###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

,SuicideWatch,"my fucked up logic is that they'll only have to mourn one day of the year i guess. though i know it'll crush them in so many ways. it's so fucked up. my family was talking about birthday plans today as it's coming up soon and i just replied like a fucking robot saying all the things i should say and I'm a LIAR i was lying to their fucking faces. my birthday is always the most depressing time of year. i hate that i was even born so.. so much. I've been depressed and suicidal since i was so little and i honestly have no good reason. nothing ever really happened to me i guess it's just my brain and i feel so shitty that some people here don't even have someone to mourn them. i think about the people that have no one to care about them and i feel so bad and i wish i could give up my life for them or donate my organs and blood for people who needed it just so i could feel good when i commit ""the most selfish act""... it also just lines up with a lot right now  ..it just feels right. it's been a long grueling couple of years since my last attempt and nothing has felt right since then. i am in so much pain and i just want freedom i just a release from all this physicial and mental pain. i guess... a lot of you will tell me not to do it for a lot of reasons. and I don't want to ""argue against"" you i really don't because you have good intentions. but I can't help but feel they're blind replies and you don't really know me so I don't know what to say. should i convince you i am someone who needs to die? thats sounds awful and ultimately negative. but I'm just so alone and scared and tired and posting and replying to posts here because people in the same train of thought feel familiar to me and i only feel a connection in this fucked up way to others that feel the same. but I don't want anyone to die. suicide is so ugly and i wish there was anothet way to just end it and not have all the mess and shit that follows but it's like we can't have that. its always going to be a shitstorm that sucks sooo.. so bad... but come on.. I don't know... i can't begin to explain to you why i feel it's the right decision and i dont WANT TO explain or have you believe or agree with me  .. but I'm just soo fucking alone and want someone to hear me before i go otherwise i wouldn't post this. i know I'll be completely forgotten soon anyway. just some fucking nobody

I&amp;#39;ve been depressed and suicidal since i was so little and i honestly have no good reason. nothing ever really happened to me i guess it&amp;#39;s just my brain and i feel so shitty that some people here don&amp;#39;t even have someone to mourn them. i think about the people that have no one to care about them and i feel so bad and i wish i could give up my life for them or donate my organs and blood for people who needed it just so i could feel good when i commit &amp;quot;the most selfish act&amp;quot;... it also just lines up with a lot right now  ..it just feels right. it&amp;#39;s been a long grueling couple of years since my last attempt and nothing has felt right since then. i am in so much pain and i just want freedom i just a release from all this physicial and mental pain. i guess... a lot of you will tell me not to do it for a lot of reasons. and I don&amp;#39;t want to &amp;quot;argue against&amp;quot; you i really don&amp;#39;t because you have good intentions. but I can&amp;#39;t help but feel they&amp;#39;re blind replies and you don&amp;#39;t really know me so I don&amp;#39;t know what to say. should i convince you i am someone who needs to die? thats sounds awful and ultimately negative. but I&amp;#39;m just so alone and scared and tired and posting and replying to posts here because people in the same train of thought feel familiar to me and i only feel a connection in this fucked up way to others that feel the same. but I don&amp;#39;t want anyone to die. suicide is so ugly and i wish there was anothet way to just end it and not have all the mess and shit that follows but it&amp;#39;s like we can&amp;#39;t have that. its always going to be a shitstorm that sucks sooo.. so bad... but come on..

So. Friday night, my sister took a whole bottle, 60 pills worth, of her antidepressants. Beforehand, she had called around and apologized to a few people about things that I'm not privy to. This set off alarm bells, and somebody called emergency responders to the scene. 

When they arrived, they found her with a note, and... well, she survived. They took her to the hospital, but now she is in a behavioral health clinic. A state away. And we can't go see her. 

I am at a loss. I. Don't even know if this is the right place to come with my story. Or even what I want by telling said story. I just. 

I almost lost my sister. I was *this* close and had no idea. None. I hate this feeling. And I can't even go to her. I don't know. I don't know where to go, or what to think. 

Mainly I'm just talking I guess. Then you for reading.

,SuicideWatch,"I've had suicidal thoughts for the last 11 years or so. Back in 2010, I had decided that I'd kill myself using aspirin the day after my HS graduation. Like an idiot, I kept going because I wanted to see what I could do in the world. I bought into the lie of college, got myself into a near 40k student loan debt going for my degree in computer science. On graduation, I couldn't find a job and my credit suffered. I see that as my first clue that I should have killed myself. 

But I kept going. I enlisted in the military (my grades from college were subpar, not enough for officer) so I joined the USAF. Worked in weather. Met some cool people. Got deployed. Saw straight up pieces of a guy on the ground. I took that as my 2nd clue. It was awful. But I kept going. I was stationed in Japan and I met my wife. Our son was born a year later. I worked hard and got pretty damn good at Japanese. I was even promoted to staff sergeant. Life was good. I was beginning to think life was worth living. 

We came back to the states in 2018 and things just fell apart from there. A series of lies and false accusations led to a lack of faith in me by leadership. A mistake in a forecast I did cemented that. Weeks of 12 hour shifts drove me crazy. This was my 3rd clue, but again I was persistent. I was straight up told by my commander that he wouldn't sign for my re-enlistment. I was told by both legal and everyone I talked to, to just take the honorable discharge and go.

I tried to find jobs before I was discharged. But NOTHING came up in the area. So I had to swallow my pride and return home to my folk's place with my wife and son. Mind you, my parents don't like my wife; she's Asian, and my folks aren't very big on my siblings and I being with with anyone who isn't black. Sure, they accepted us. But they're cold to me and ignore my wife, but expect to play with my son. Then fucking covid happened. There was no quality work with my skillset to be found ANYWHERE. The only place to give me a job so far is goddamn Walmart. I make less than 1k a month and my folks demand HALF my pay for living in the house I was raised in. We have nowhere else to go with Japan on lockdown and no cash for an apartment. Had no choice but to accept. They know we need to save money, especially with my wife not having her green cars yet.

I cry every night because everything feels so goddamn hopeless. I cuss every time I wake up. I look at my son and get angry at myself for being a failure of a father.

I'm afraid what my son will think of his dad choosing to abandon his mother because he couldn't stand tall in dark times. I get screamed at every day at Walmart by psychos trying to steal TVs and karens looking for lysol. I've become a walking corpse that can only live for others and I feel like I'm starting to crack. 

I don't have opinions anymore. I try not to think. If I think too much I start crying. I look at the aspirin in the cabinet and it just looks more preferable every goddamn day.

Back in 2010, I had decided that I&amp;#39;d kill myself using aspirin the day after my HS graduation. Like an idiot, I kept going because I wanted to see what I could do in the world. I bought into the lie of college, got myself into a near 40k student loan debt going for my degree in computer science. On graduation, I couldn&amp;#39;t find a job and my credit suffered. I see that as my first clue that I should have killed myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I kept going. I enlisted in the military (my grades from college were subpar, not enough for officer) so I joined the USAF. Worked in weather. Met some cool people. Got deployed. Saw straight up pieces of a guy on the ground. I took that as my 2nd clue. It was awful. But I kept going. I was stationed in Japan and I met my wife. Our son was born a year later. I worked hard and got pretty damn good at Japanese. I was even promoted to staff sergeant. Life was good. I was beginning to think life was worth living. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We came back to the states in 2018 and things just fell apart from there. A series of lies and false accusations led to a lack of faith in me by leadership. A mistake in a forecast I did cemented that. Weeks of 12 hour shifts drove me crazy. This was my 3rd clue, but again I was persistent. I was straight up told by my commander that he wouldn&amp;#39;t sign for my re-enlistment. I was told by both legal and everyone I talked to, to just take the honorable discharge and go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tried to find jobs before I was discharged. But NOTHING came up in the area. So I had to swallow my pride and return home to my folk&amp;#39;s place with my wife and son. Mind you, my parents don&amp;#39;t like my wife; she&amp;#39;s Asian, and my folks aren&amp;#39;t very big on my siblings and I being with with anyone who isn&amp;#39;t black. Sure, they accepted us. But they&amp;#39;re cold to me and ignore my wife, but expect to play with my son. Then fucking covid happened. There was no quality work with my skillset to be found ANYWHERE. The only place to give me a job so far is goddamn Walmart. I make less than 1k a month and my folks demand HALF my pay for living in the house I was raised in. We have nowhere else to go with Japan on lockdown and no cash for an apartment. Had no choice but to accept. They know we need to save money, especially with my wife not having her green cars yet. I&amp;#39;m the only one working. Do they care? Fuck no. That was my 4th clue. &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Came to rant since I have absolutely no one to talk to. I just want to tell someone about my situation and just my story, not sure why really. If you don’t want to read this essay then it’s fine, it’s long and boring anyway 

Today I had a really bad fight with my mother, she got offended by my tone when I was talking about my own problems, yelling at me that I’m pissing her off, I told her to chill and got a “shove that down your throat and shut the f*ck up!!” and after that the argument started. 

She was always a bit unstable, whenever I told her something was her fault she yelled “Yes yes it’s all my f*cking fault! All of you are saints, absolute saints and then there’s me, this b*tch that’s ruining all your lives, go on and stab me!!” and then there was no stopping her for hours, then when she asks for advice and I give it to her she ignores me or lectures me about how wrong I am, but when anyone besides me tells her the same thing she is like an obedient puppy, listing to every word and even tell me about how they are right, if I mention that I was the first one to say it she yells again. She claims to hate it when people even talk loudly and will ignore anyone with a loud voice but she herself yells a lot and when she is saying something important she starts muttering inaudibly and will refuse to repeat herself. 

Because of the current situation I can’t exactly leave to go study, and finding a place to rent in my country is extremely difficult as everything is really expensive (or super cheap but is in an extremely shady area where you are most likely going to get robbed) so I have to keep living with that woman. She’s been that way my entire life, when I was little I was blamed for everything because I was labelled as the “problem child”. I was diagnosed with autism when I was little but my family doesn’t believe in mental illnesses. 

I don’t have any other family besides her, dad walked out years ago. My older sister even attempted to kill me by suffocating me, her boyfriend had to step in and pull her away or else I would have ended up really injured. My brother has his own family so for him I’m just a pest, he openly complained about me being embarrassing because I’m “inadequate” because I’m not a social butterfly like him.

Along with all that there’s also the bullying I got at school. When I was little I didn’t have the same new toys as other kids so I was bullied for being boring and lame, then it changed to being bullied because I wasn’t allowed to watch the same shows as others so I didn’t have anything interesting to say, and then it just kept on going until everyone just mocked everything about me. Then it got to the point where they were betting money on how long it would take to make me angry, their parents told my parents and my teachers but none did anything. Then once when a teacher told me off in front of the class for “don’t be rude to other people!” I started crying and the next day I find out that apparently my classmates were spamming “OP was crying! OP was crying!” because I always held it in but then I finally snapped.

When I changed school I went to another country for that (mother came along as I wasn’t old enough yet) and there I was mostly left alone but there were people who bullied me because of my nationality (they didn’t like outsiders at that school, especially the teachers) so I decided to just hang in there, I passed my exams, got decent grades and returned home. 

Then the pandemic hit so I can’t travel anywhere and since what I’m studying requires you to actually be there physically so online doesn’t work for my subject.

So now I’m just stuck, I have no one and my mother is slowly driving me insane and with today’s fight I’m feeling even worse, I’ve been contemplating suicide a lot, I tried cutting but got scared so instead I cut up my leg, I tried hanging but got scared so stopped last minute, and now I actually got a pack of sleeping pills and was thinking of ending it that way, no pain and no worries. Though one thing is stopping me and that is my dog, I got him when I returned home, just a little bit before the pandemic, he’s the reason I’m still alive since I doubt my family would care for him once I’m gone, but now I don’t think even my boi will be enough to stop me. I trained my dog to be very well behaved so most likely it will be easy to find him a good home, maybe even my brother would take him in since he has a kid who likes dogs. 

I don’t really know what’s the point of this post but I just want to make it anyway, maybe someone here will tell me something that can keep me going hopefully, I’m scared of dying but at the same time I don’t want to endure this anymore. I think I’d be doing everyone a favour by dying, my family won’t be hurt at all, and I have no one else who worries about me, so logically this is the best option for me. I’m kinda hoping someone here will be able to change my mind even a tiny bit.

,SuicideWatch,"sorry in advance for the long post and the giant block of text idk how to make it look pretty and easier to read, here's the story of my life and it's missing a lot of stuff but those are traumas I can't get myself to share.

basically ever since I was a kid i've always been really depressed and always isolated myself. I lost my dad when I was 3 and around the age of 7 I started thinking about suicide a lot. I would put myself at risk hoping that something would happen and I would die because I was always too much of a pussy to actually take things in my own hands, I would just be running in the middle of the road whenever I saw a car speeding and coming my way or a bus etc. I just wanted them to hit me and kill me but somehow they've always managed to avoid me, one time a guy even crashed while going over the speed limit because he tried to not run me over (no serious injury he was fine). after that i've always had a reckless behavior because I thought well maybe if i keep putting myself at risk like that surely something is gonna happen eventually and i'll finally be free ? so I kept doing that while growing up, I also kept isolating myself and eventually dropped out and was sent to a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt. I took random pills i found in my moms stash and hoped it would be enough but she caught me while I was almost done swallowing the last few pills. I spent a few months in the psych ward but it felt like an eternity and while I was in there they put me on a lot of different medications, one of them was xanax. after I managed to lie and convince the therapists that I was doing ok now they finally set me free and I was sent back home but by that time i had already dropped out of school and I was doing worse mentally than I was before the psych ward. so I started abusing the medications that were prescribed to me especially xanax, I would knock myself out and blackout for days and then go see my psychiatrist and tell him yeah I don't know I must have lost my meds somehow or I lost the prescription just so he would make me another one and I could go ahead and abuse them even more. I would take the amount I was prescribed for a month in maybe one to three days depending on how I felt, eventually he started getting suspicious and called my mom and she told him than I've been abusing my meds and not taking the ones that were supposed to be beneficial for me at all. so they sent me back to the psych ward once again, they didn't give me any xanax this time but just the meds that were supposed to turn me into a ""normal"" human being, none of them worked and if anything some of them gave me strength i never had to actually go thru with things and kill myself. so they cut out all those medications again and tried once again new pills, this time I figured if I wanted to get out of this place once again I would have to cheat and lie, so I did. I would not swallow my pills and throw them out and I would pretend they were working and I was feeling better, it worked and they let me out once again. I'll also mention while i'm at it that I spent new years eve and my birthday at the psych ward with no family that ever came to visit me. I was always allowed 1 hour of hanging out with my family if someone came to visit me but no one ever came. all those events happened from when I was 15 years old for the dropout of school and I just turned 20 when I got out of the psych ward the second time. I was home most of the time it was just a few months in those 5 years that I actually spent at the ward but when I wasn't there I was still suicidal and thinking about dying all the time. I never had many friends and I lost most of them, I'm not even sad about that but i'm actually more sad that the few friends that I have left that were there with me thru everything are still strangers to me and just people I can't relate to or be myself around. my ""best friend"" that i've known for 10 years actually never let me down and was always there for me no matter how down bad I was but despite everything I've never been able to truly open up to him or anyone about how I feel and who I really am. He think he knows me but in reality he has no idea of the person I am and how I feel, sometimes he tries to take me out so we can hang out with some people and I actually force myself to go but every time I just sit here surrounded by ""friends"" and despite that I still feel alone? I've always felt alone no matter who i've talked to or ""bonded"" with. around this time last year I met someone and for whatever reason I instantly actually enjoyed talking to that person it was the first time ever I actually felt not alone, and when I was talking to her it felt like everything was going to be fine and all my problems were suddenly something that didn't bother me or overwhelm me as much as it always does. we bonded really fast with each other and we were so alike it felt like all the stuff I went thru was some kind of challenge I had to endure just to have the chance to meet that person as some kind of reward for those 23 years of pain. she's the only person I was ever able to truly open up to and it was the first time I actually opened up to someone, she liked me for me and she's the only person I was ever able to be my real self around.we ended up falling in love and dating and I remember at first I thought this is too good to be true, it's a rollercoaster at one point it's gonna crash and it will be the death of me, I even told a ""friend"" that cares about me a lot(despite me not being able to care about that person or anyone else either) about it and she could see it herself that this was something really unique and some kind of bonding that didn't even seem real because of how unique it was and she told me ""if she leaves you, you'll be dead"" because my ""friend"" really understood how unique this was. but that thought went away really early on in our relationship when she also opened up to me and cried to me while saying how she genuinely felt about me and out of respect I won't say the stuff she told me but it wasn't just words that you tell someone when u get into a relationship it was deep and truly something that came from the bottom of her heart and i'm sure that she has never felt this way or said anything like that to anyone she has ever dated before me. after everything that was said I started trying my best to become someone better because for the first time in my life I actually wanted to grow old with that person and having a shitty boring life didn't mean much to me as long as I had her with me. we both felt the same way about everything it was really genuine but eventually she had a phase where she was stressed and wanted to be left alone, she didn't want to talk to me and for 2 weeks she would barely reply to me saying she just wanted to be alone for now because she felt down and stressed. I remember getting mad at her because she would ignore me and not want to talk to me but at the same time she would go out and hang out with her friends and talk to them all the time while not giving me any attention at all, she told me that she just felt empty and going out was just a way to change her mind and keep herself occupied so she wouldn't be stuck with her thoughts and that she was not talking to me and prefered hanging out with them because she felt empty and being with them was different since she doesn't have feelings for them. after those 2 weeks she broke up with me because she said in those 2 weeks where she wanted to be alone she lost all her feelings for me and everyone else, but considering the people she used to hang out with all day during that time are now really close to her it's easy to figure out it's just me she lost feelings for. after that she tried to reach up to me and tried to make us stay friends but most of the time it would end up in us arguing because I had too many questions about everything and she either gave answers that made no sense to me or said ""not everything in life makes sense"". I told her I hoped one day her feelings would come back and everything would be fine again but I doubt it, to which she replied something like ""I don't know that and neither do you"" or ""you can't predict the future"". and every time I mentioned I would wait for her forever because she was and she still is the only person that could ever make me feel whole, things got worse and all of a sudden things went from maybe my feelings will come back maybe they wont to ""I don't think they ever will"" ""move on because I will"" ""don't wait for me you'll be disappointed and it stresses me out even more"". but what hurts the most out of all the stuff that was said is that she said multiple times that i'm the right person for her it was just and still is the wrong time, and that's when I started getting really mean to her and everytime she would try to text me to be friends I would just get really angry and I would be mean to her. I even told her multiple times how can you say i'm the right person for you and then tell me literally in the next sentence ""but you should move on because i will"" you don't believe i'm the right person if that's how you see things, but no she kept telling me that i'm the right person again and again, it didn't matter how many times I screamed at her or flamed her for it she kept insisting. she also said I was the best person she ever met even after the breakup she kept saying that, one night after she tried once again to reach out to me to be friends and on good terms despite me screaming at her and being really mean as always she said those exact words ""you're the best person I know and i'll always care about you"". when we were together she used to say it all the time as well and even before we caught feelings for each other, she always told me I was the best person she had ever met, eventually after weeks or months of her trying to be my friend and me pushing her away each time she said ""will things always be like this between us"" and said it made her feel sad and angry so i eventually gave in and said sure let's try to be friends I guess I don't really have the will power or energy left to scream at you if that makes you feel any better. ever since then it's been terrible because we don't talk much even tho she says she wants us to be really close friends like we were at first before any feelings were involved, she doesn't open up, if i try to make a convo and ask what she's doing today she refuses to tell me, she pretty much just refuses to tell me anything about her life because that's none of my business anymore. a lot of the stuff she says and she promise me she means it just sounds so fake because her actions are literally the opposite. not too long ago when I was pushing her away she kept saying I was the best person she knows but after having a talk about her so i could maybe get some insight on how she feels because like I said most of the stuff she says doesn't align with her actions she now said ""you're one of the best, but not the best person i know"". it's funny how things change so fast and how as soon as I gave in and literally tried my best to hurt in silence and not show her how i felt inside so i wouldn't make her feel sad or bad i now mean less than I did when I was just pushing her away and screaming at her. when she broke up with me she also mentioned she doesn't like being in a relationship because of those phases where she feels empty and just wants to be alone and she said she doesn't want a relationship or anything in her life for now, but after getting mad at her she eventually told me she's been talking to someone lately and she's right it's none of my business but it sounds really wrong and fucked up when she said she didn't want any relationship in her life for now when breaking up with me and considering every promises she has ever made me and everything she has ever told me in the past. I remember being really insecure about someone in her life, just a coworker that she met one day while we were still dating and they became somewhat friends just at work but one night a few weeks after that maybe she told me he tried to flirt with her and that she thinks he likes her and she said ""doesn't know I have a bf i guess i'll let him know"", i got mad about that guy and she said ""chill i didn't go along with it"", and I know she would have never cheated on me but I couldn't help being jealous. eventually they started hanging out together as friends more and more and I would get insecure about it and I would tell her and also remind her of that one time he tried to flirt, and now she kept telling me he wasn't trying to flirt it's not like that it was just a misunderstanding he's not interested in me and neither am I, but to me what that guy told her literally was flirting and i'm not sure how she convinced herself it wasn't when she's the one that told me about it and called it flirting in the first place. they kept getting closer to the point where nowadays he's her best friend and they're really close, that's something I got mad at her for and screamed at her for one night because I told myself yeah she dumped me and now she's going out with the one guy I was literally insecure about. but no she told me they're really close friends but it's not like that and that's how she told me she's been talking to someone she said i've been talking to someone but no him so stop assuming things. but does it even matter, I used to be her best friend before we caught feelings for each other and then I was also her boyfriend, those 2 spots were mine and now none of them is. I got replaced, and i'll slowly become a memory that she will eventually erase from her brain. I've always hated myself so how can I blame her for wanting to be with someone else? I never understood why she loved me, especially with everything she said it wasn't just the type of love from some random relationship, it was love in it's purest form. it's hard to explain without context on everything she promised and used to say back then and I know it sounds like just any breakup but it's really not and I know saying this also sounds like what every person would say as soon as they get out of a relationship but once again trust me it's really not. she's the only person I've ever cared about and I still care about her to this day more than anything, that's something that will never change. It was her or nobody until the end and i'll stand by that no matter what. I wasn't abusing drugs when I met her I would sometimes take something just to have fun but rarely and that's how she used drugs as well, and when we were together we would sometimes take something together but in a responsible way and not often. after the breakup and everything tho I started abusing drugs daily and in stupid dosages, I wanted to be numb and not feel anything because when I was sober the pain I was feeling was so much worse than I thought it could ever be. I can't describe how much it hurts and even tho I was depressed and suicidal my whole life and had a really low point where I lost a family member and was in the worst pain i could have ever imagined, I never thought it could get worse and when I look at myself today and how I hurt daily and what my thoughts are constantly during the day i'm genuinely amazed at how bad everything is. but yeah I abused drugs a lot, ended up in the hospital around 3 times in a month because I was od'ing, my heart from a medical point of view is in a really shitty condition due to the drug abuse and apparently it will take a really long time to heal from what i've been told, but even if it does heal that won't heal my sorrows and everything else so I couldn't care less. when she heard about it tho she asked me to stop taking drugs and even tho my life is literally hell right now because I lost her I still promised her I would stop taking drugs because at the end of the day she's the only person I care about and I can't get myself to say no to her, so I did and i've been sober for around 2 weeks now. without the drugs tho, things are worse because I have to actually face everything daily without any interruption. i've never wanted to kill myself more than I do nowadays and there's not a single day that goes by where I don't prepare everything and get ready to do it and then I just sit here looking at all the pills from my drug stash with all the deadly combinations and insane dosages i could take and mix to make sure I die for good this time and it takes all the strength I have in me to not go for it. I sit for hours watching all the pills, counting the dosages, making sure mixing those and those are lethal and even if some of those don't interact with each other I know that a mix of so many drugs and in such a retarded dosage is for sure going to kill me. and I want to do it, more than ever and I'm always so close to doing it but then I tell myself if I die would she even care? would she even notice? and the thing that has been stopping me so far is the fact that if I do go thru with it and she somehow finds out about it, there's a possibility she'll be sad and there's a possibility she'll blame herself and I don't want to hurt her despite the fact that she hurt me more than anyone or anything has ever did. I don't want her to live her life thinking this was her fault but then again maybe it wouldn't phase her at all and if it did maybe she would get over it really fast just like she did with me. but I can't anymore, it just gets worse and worse every day and it's getting harder and harder to stop myself from doing it, so i'll finally go thru with but I'll do my best to try and survive for the next 2 months. I want to do it at a special date and in 2 months there's 2 events in particular that sound to me like it will be the right time to do it, there's my birthday and a few days after that there's the date where she first admitted to me she loved me, so i'll pick one of these two to end it all if I can even manage to hold on for that long. don't get me wrong i've always been suicidal and i've attempted suicide a few times before I even met her, this isn't her fault, it's just a mix of everything that has ever happened, I was abused as a kid, I've seen 2 out of the 3 people that ever mattered to me die and the third one just made empty promises and hurt me more than anything ever did and now that she's gone it's time to put an end to everything. I managed to survive for 23 almost 24 years somehow but now I just can't keep going anymore. I'm not sure why I wrote all of this I didn't even want this to be a long essay at first but I needed to get this off my chest. it doesn't really matter if anyone takes the time to read this or not and if someone does, please don't come at me with stuff like ""hang in there"" ""it gets better"" ""you'll find someone else"" ""you can focus on making ur future better"" ""you're just heartbroken it will go away eventually"" ""time heals wounds"" blablabla I really don't care and like I said i know this looks and sounds like just another heartbreak and eventually i'll move on but I can assure you that everything before her already made me want to end my life and that now it's a billion times worse than it has ever been because she was truly the one and only and the bond we had was something I had never seen anyone else experience before and it would be impossible to properly describe it. I've tried to kill myself multiple times when I was happier than this, nowadays everything is much worse than I could have ever imagined. so yeah that's it I guess, I hope no one ever has to experience the way I feel and if you made it to the end thank you for taking the time out of your life to read the tragedy that is my life, there's a lot of stuff that wasn't said and traumas that I don't want to get into but I can't be bothered anymore.",t2_wcmzmzj,False,,0,False,ending it all in less than 2 months,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,True,t3_jywp4r,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606084971.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;sorry in advance for the long post and the giant block of text idk how to make it look pretty and easier to read, here&amp;#39;s the story of my life and it&amp;#39;s missing a lot of stuff but those are traumas I can&amp;#39;t get myself to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;basically ever since I was a kid i&amp;#39;ve always been really depressed and always isolated myself. I lost my dad when I was 3 and around the age of 7 I started thinking about suicide a lot. I would put myself at risk hoping that something would happen and I would die because I was always too much of a pussy to actually take things in my own hands, I would just be running in the middle of the road whenever I saw a car speeding and coming my way or a bus etc. I just wanted them to hit me and kill me but somehow they&amp;#39;ve always managed to avoid me, one time a guy even crashed while going over the speed limit because he tried to not run me over (no serious injury he was fine). after that i&amp;#39;ve always had a reckless behavior because I thought well maybe if i keep putting myself at risk like that surely something is gonna happen eventually and i&amp;#39;ll finally be free ? so I kept doing that while growing up, I also kept isolating myself and eventually dropped out and was sent to a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt. I took random pills i found in my moms stash and hoped it would be enough but she caught me while I was almost done swallowing the last few pills. I spent a few months in the psych ward but it felt like an eternity and while I was in there they put me on a lot of different medications, one of them was xanax. after I managed to lie and convince the therapists that I was doing ok now they finally set me free and I was sent back home but by that time i had already dropped out of school and I was doing worse mentally than I was before the psych ward. so I started abusing the medications that were prescribed to me especially xanax, I would knock myself out and blackout for days and then go see my psychiatrist and tell him yeah I don&amp;#39;t know I must have lost my meds somehow or I lost the prescription just so he would make me another one and I could go ahead and abuse them even more. I would take the amount I was prescribed for a month in maybe one to three days depending on how I felt, eventually he started getting suspicious and called my mom and she told him than I&amp;#39;ve been abusing my meds and not taking the ones that were supposed to be beneficial for me at all. so they sent me back to the psych ward once again, they didn&amp;#39;t give me any xanax this time but just the meds that were supposed to turn me into a &amp;quot;normal&amp;quot; human being, none of them worked and if anything some of them gave me strength i never had to actually go thru with things and kill myself. so they cut out all those medications again and tried once again new pills, this time I figured if I wanted to get out of this place once again I would have to cheat and lie, so I did. I would not swallow my pills and throw them out and I would pretend they were working and I was feeling better, it worked and they let me out once again. I&amp;#39;ll also mention while i&amp;#39;m at it that I spent new years eve and my birthday at the psych ward with no family that ever came to visit me. I was always allowed 1 hour of hanging out with my family if someone came to visit me but no one ever came. all those events happened from when I was 15 years old for the dropout of school and I just turned 20 when I got out of the psych ward the second time. I was home most of the time it was just a few months in those 5 years that I actually spent at the ward but when I wasn&amp;#39;t there I was still suicidal and thinking about dying all the time. I never had many friends and I lost most of them, I&amp;#39;m not even sad about that but i&amp;#39;m actually more sad that the few friends that I have left that were there with me thru everything are still strangers to me and just people I can&amp;#39;t relate to or be myself around. my &amp;quot;best friend&amp;quot; that i&amp;#39;ve known for 10 years actually never let me down and was always there for me no matter how down bad I was but despite everything I&amp;#39;ve never been able to truly open up to him or anyone about how I feel and who I really am. He think he knows me but in reality he has no idea of the person I am and how I feel, sometimes he tries to take me out so we can hang out with some people and I actually force myself to go but every time I just sit here surrounded by &amp;quot;friends&amp;quot; and despite that I still feel alone? I&amp;#39;ve always felt alone no matter who i&amp;#39;ve talked to or &amp;quot;bonded&amp;quot; with. around this time last year I met someone and for whatever reason I instantly actually enjoyed talking to that person it was the first time ever I actually felt not alone, and when I was talking to her it felt like everything was going to be fine and all my problems were suddenly something that didn&amp;#39;t bother me or overwhelm me as much as it always does. we bonded really fast with each other and we were so alike it felt like all the stuff I went thru was some kind of challenge I had to endure just to have the chance to meet that person as some kind of reward for those 23 years of pain. she&amp;#39;s the only person I was ever able to truly open up to and it was the first time I actually opened up to someone, she liked me for me and she&amp;#39;s the only person I was ever able to be my real self around.we ended up falling in love and dating and I remember at first I thought this is too good to be true, it&amp;#39;s a rollercoaster at one point it&amp;#39;s gonna crash and it will be the death of me, I even told a &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; that cares about me a lot(despite me not being able to care about that person or anyone else either) about it and she could see it herself that this was something really unique and some kind of bonding that didn&amp;#39;t even seem real because of how unique it was and she told me &amp;quot;if she leaves you, you&amp;#39;ll be dead&amp;quot; because my &amp;quot;friend&amp;quot; really understood how unique this was. but that thought went away really early on in our relationship when she also opened up to me and cried to me while saying how she genuinely felt about me and out of respect I won&amp;#39;t say the stuff she told me but it wasn&amp;#39;t just words that you tell someone when u get into a relationship it was deep and truly something that came from the bottom of her heart and i&amp;#39;m sure that she has never felt this way or said anything like that to anyone she has ever dated before me. after everything that was said I started trying my best to become someone better because for the first time in my life I actually wanted to grow old with that person and having a shitty boring life didn&amp;#39;t mean much to me as long as I had her with me. we both felt the same way about everything it was really genuine but eventually she had a phase where she was stressed and wanted to be left alone, she didn&amp;#39;t want to talk to me and for 2 weeks she would barely reply to me saying she just wanted to be alone for now because she felt down and stressed. I remember getting mad at her because she would ignore me and not want to talk to me but at the same time she would go out and hang out with her friends and talk to them all the time while not giving me any attention at all, she told me that she just felt empty and going out was just a way to change her mind and keep herself occupied so she wouldn&amp;#39;t be stuck with her thoughts and that she was not talking to me and prefered hanging out with them because she felt empty and being with them was different since she doesn&amp;#39;t have feelings for them. after those 2 weeks she broke up with me because she said in those 2 weeks where she wanted to be alone she lost all her feelings for me and everyone else, but considering the people she used to hang out with all day during that time are now really close to her it&amp;#39;s easy to figure out it&amp;#39;s just me she lost feelings for. after that she tried to reach up to me and tried to make us stay friends but most of the time it would end up in us arguing because I had too many questions about everything and she either gave answers that made no sense to me or said &amp;quot;not everything in life makes sense&amp;quot;. I told her I hoped one day her feelings would come back and everything would be fine again but I doubt it, to which she replied something like &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t know that and neither do you&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;you can&amp;#39;t predict the future&amp;quot;. and every time I mentioned I would wait for her forever because she was and she still is the only person that could ever make me feel whole, things got worse and all of a sudden things went from maybe my feelings will come back maybe they wont to &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t think they ever will&amp;quot; &amp;quot;move on because I will&amp;quot; &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t wait for me you&amp;#39;ll be disappointed and it stresses me out even more&amp;quot;. but what hurts the most out of all the stuff that was said is that she said multiple times that i&amp;#39;m the right person for her it was just and still is the wrong time, and that&amp;#39;s when I started getting really mean to her and everytime she would try to text me to be friends I would just get really angry and I would be mean to her. I even told her multiple times how can you say i&amp;#39;m the right person for you and then tell me literally in the next sentence &amp;quot;but you should move on because i will&amp;quot; you don&amp;#39;t believe i&amp;#39;m the right person if that&amp;#39;s how you see things, but no she kept telling me that i&amp;#39;m the right person again and again, it didn&amp;#39;t matter how many times I screamed at her or flamed her for it she kept insisting. she also said I was the best person she ever met even after the breakup she kept saying that, one night after she tried once again to reach out to me to be friends and on good terms despite me screaming at her and being really mean as always she said those exact words &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re the best person I know and i&amp;#39;ll always care about you&amp;quot;. when we were together she used to say it all the time as well and even before we caught feelings for each other, she always told me I was the best person she had ever met, eventually after weeks or months of her trying to be my friend and me pushing her away each time she said &amp;quot;will things always be like this between us&amp;quot; and said it made her feel sad and angry so i eventually gave in and said sure let&amp;#39;s try to be friends I guess I don&amp;#39;t really have the will power or energy left to scream at you if that makes you feel any better. ever since then it&amp;#39;s been terrible because we don&amp;#39;t talk much even tho she says she wants us to be really close friends like we were at first before any feelings were involved, she doesn&amp;#39;t open up, if i try to make a convo and ask what she&amp;#39;s doing today she refuses to tell me, she pretty much just refuses to tell me anything about her life because that&amp;#39;s none of my business anymore. a lot of the stuff she says and she promise me she means it just sounds so fake because her actions are literally the opposite. not too long ago when I was pushing her away she kept saying I was the best person she knows but after having a talk about her so i could maybe get some insight on how she feels because like I said most of the stuff she says doesn&amp;#39;t align with her actions she now said &amp;quot;you&amp;#39;re one of the best, but not the best person i know&amp;quot;. it&amp;#39;s funny how things change so fast and how as soon as I gave in and literally tried my best to hurt in silence and not show her how i felt inside so i wouldn&amp;#39;t make her feel sad or bad i now mean less than I did when I was just pushing her away and screaming at her. when she broke up with me she also mentioned she doesn&amp;#39;t like being in a relationship because of those phases where she feels empty and just wants to be alone and she said she doesn&amp;#39;t want a relationship or anything in her life for now, but after getting mad at her she eventually told me she&amp;#39;s been talking to someone lately and she&amp;#39;s right it&amp;#39;s none of my business but it sounds really wrong and fucked up when she said she didn&amp;#39;t want any relationship in her life for now when breaking up with me and considering every promises she has ever made me and everything she has ever told me in the past. I remember being really insecure about someone in her life, just a coworker that she met one day while we were still dating and they became somewhat friends just at work but one night a few weeks after that maybe she told me he tried to flirt with her and that she thinks he likes her and she said &amp;quot;doesn&amp;#39;t know I have a bf i guess i&amp;#39;ll let him know&amp;quot;, i got mad about that guy and she said &amp;quot;chill i didn&amp;#39;t go along with it&amp;quot;, and I know she would have never cheated on me but I couldn&amp;#39;t help being jealous. eventually they started hanging out together as friends more and more and I would get insecure about it and I would tell her and also remind her of that one time he tried to flirt, and now she kept telling me he wasn&amp;#39;t trying to flirt it&amp;#39;s not like that it was just a misunderstanding he&amp;#39;s not interested in me and neither am I, but to me what that guy told her literally was flirting and i&amp;#39;m not sure how she convinced herself it wasn&amp;#39;t when she&amp;#39;s the one that told me about it and called it flirting in the first place. they kept getting closer to the point where nowadays he&amp;#39;s her best friend and they&amp;#39;re really close, that&amp;#39;s something I got mad at her for and screamed at her for one night because I told myself yeah she dumped me and now she&amp;#39;s going out with the one guy I was literally insecure about. but no she told me they&amp;#39;re really close friends but it&amp;#39;s not like that and that&amp;#39;s how she told me she&amp;#39;s been talking to someone she said i&amp;#39;ve been talking to someone but no him so stop assuming things. but does it even matter, I used to be her best friend before we caught feelings for each other and then I was also her boyfriend, those 2 spots were mine and now none of them is. I got replaced, and i&amp;#39;ll slowly become a memory that she will eventually erase from her brain. I&amp;#39;ve always hated myself so how can I blame her for wanting to be with someone else? I never understood why she loved me, especially with everything she said it wasn&amp;#39;t just the type of love from some random relationship, it was love in it&amp;#39;s purest form. it&amp;#39;s hard to explain without context on everything she promised and used to say back then and I know it sounds like just any breakup but it&amp;#39;s really not and I know saying this also sounds like what every person would say as soon as they get out of a relationship but once again trust me it&amp;#39;s really not. she&amp;#39;s the only person I&amp;#39;ve ever cared about and I still care about her to this day more than anything, that&amp;#39;s something that will never change. It was her or nobody until the end and i&amp;#39;ll stand by that no matter what. I wasn&amp;#39;t abusing drugs when I met her I would sometimes take something just to have fun but rarely and that&amp;#39;s how she used drugs as well, and when we were together we would sometimes take something together but in a responsible way and not often. after the breakup and everything tho I started abusing drugs daily and in stupid dosages, I wanted to be numb and not feel anything because when I was sober the pain I was feeling was so much worse than I thought it could ever be. I can&amp;#39;t describe how much it hurts and even tho I was depressed and suicidal my whole life and had a really low point where I lost a family member and was in the worst pain i could have ever imagined, I never thought it could get worse and when I look at myself today and how I hurt daily and what my thoughts are constantly during the day i&amp;#39;m genuinely amazed at how bad everything is. but yeah I abused drugs a lot, ended up in the hospital around 3 times in a month because I was od&amp;#39;ing, my heart from a medical point of view is in a really shitty condition due to the drug abuse and apparently it will take a really long time to heal from what i&amp;#39;ve been told, but even if it does heal that won&amp;#39;t heal my sorrows and everything else so I couldn&amp;#39;t care less. when she heard about it tho she asked me to stop taking drugs and even tho my life is literally hell right now because I lost her I still promised her I would stop taking drugs because at the end of the day she&amp;#39;s the only person I care about and I can&amp;#39;t get myself to say no to her, so I did and i&amp;#39;ve been sober for around 2 weeks now. without the drugs tho, things are worse because I have to actually face everything daily without any interruption. i&amp;#39;ve never wanted to kill myself more than I do nowadays and there&amp;#39;s not a single day that goes by where I don&amp;#39;t prepare everything and get ready to do it and then I just sit here looking at all the pills from my drug stash with all the deadly combinations and insane dosages i could take and mix to make sure I die for good this time and it takes all the strength I have in me to not go for it.

It’s almost like I don’t dare to make a change, even though I so passionately long for it? I want a divorce. I want to move states. I want a complete and entire personality make-over. I want to go to therapy. I want to be my own person. But I can’t.

The last four years have been a nightmare. I got married pretty young, I moved to a place I never wanted to move to. I did a lot of things to please others and I pretty much lost my own will during the process.

Since then, life has been dull. I haven’t left the house alone in over four years. I have lost all of my friends. I’ve been isolated and my anxieties have skyrocketed. I can’t do anything on my own anymore. It’s not that my husband wouldn’t let me - at all. It’s more like I lost the capability to. I’m scared of everything.

I want to change so many things in my life but I cannot do it. I cannot change. I feel like I am trapped within myself.

I feel like I’m actively, yet somehow unknowingly, restricting myself from overcoming this crippling stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s almost like I don’t dare to make a change, even though I so passionately long for it? I want a divorce. I want to move states. I want a complete and entire personality make-over. I want to go to therapy. I want to be my own person. But I can’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last four years have been a nightmare. I got married pretty young, I moved to a place I never wanted to move to. I did a lot of things to please others and I pretty much lost my own will during the process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, life has been dull. I haven’t left the house alone in over four years. I have lost all of my friends. I’ve been isolated and my anxieties have skyrocketed. I can’t do anything on my own anymore. It’s not that my husband wouldn’t let me - at all. It’s more like I lost the capability to. I’m scared of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want to change so many things in my life but I cannot do it. I cannot change. I feel like I am trapped within myself. I can’t even take my own life because I feel like that would be too much responsibility. Because I cannot make big decisions for my own life - or death for that matter. I’m not scared of death. But I can’t escape the stagnation.&lt;/p&gt;

I was looking at old pictures of myself and friends that I used to have, and I'm pretty sure I mentally died or lost my soul or something in my early 20s. Idk how to explain it (I'm 28 rn). I think my body wants to make it right and follow suit.

Looking at them should bring me happiness from those great memories but they only make me inexplicably and deeply sad.

I thought I had this under control a few years ago, but its all come crashing down. Realizing I'm useless without being able to work. I have no real friends today, and all but one of my past friends have anything to do with me. I reach out but I can tell they don't want to talk to me.

March 10th, 2017. 26y/o My brother overdosed and died in his sleep.

December 26, 2019. 21y/o My husband's brother was killed in a car crash the day after Christmas, he has 2 kids.

June 9th, 2020. 25y/o My battle I deployed with, he took his own life a year after we got back home.

I'm tired of seeing people die when my worthless ass is still alive. Its cruel.

I somehow managed to get re-married after a really fucking hard divorce(was my best friend at the time and we were together 7 years, his family was always so affectionate, it made me feel good. But we brought out the worst in each other. Leaving was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I knew it was best for the both of us). My current spouse is so sweet and patient I don't feel like I deserve him.  I feel like I tricked him into a relationship with me and I'm draining his happiness the same way I did my ex. He tries his best but for some reason I can't change and that's what hurts the most.

I wish I could get rid of these feelings and just be happy.

A few years ago, work running and the gym took up most of my free time and now my back is so fucking messed up I can hardly even walk right.

I feel like I've just hurt everyone I've ever come into contact with, I'm the only common denominator.

I wish I could just have my memories wiped or just stop existing. I feel like the ragged old dog that needs to be put down, but the owner doesn't want to because hes so used to the dog being around.

I'm currently on 5 different psych meds, and I talk to a therapist once a week. But its somehow still not enough to make me normal. My meds STRICTLY say not to drink alcohol, but I'm now drowning my sorrows with some cheap vodka and sunny-d. This post has taken a while to write.

I don't mean at all for it to be attention seeking.- If worse comes to worst I guess this can serve as a suicide note.

That same year during winter break on New Years night once again on vacation with my family, I was drunk and listening to Cavetown out on the deck sitting on top of the ocean. I wanted to roll in and just sink and was damn close to it. The good news i guess is that was the last time, but the first half of this year was filled with drinking and being catatonic while the second has been filled with working from 8AM to 2AM every weekday and drinking on the weekends. I&amp;#39;ve never been able to tell anyone since I&amp;#39;m just the darling child going to be a doctor one day and the top of my program in college when in reality when I see myself, I only think about how I&amp;#39;ve been having suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and only survive by working hard enough to be too tired to kill myself. I want to check into a mental hospital this winter break but just accepted a good position to be working 40 hours a week and I need the money, but I&amp;#39;m terrified that this winter break will be the time I finally go thru with it.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch," 

I've been suicidal for more than half my life now, and I feel like it should be recognized as enough time for me to understand and consider all the risks and make an informed decision. I hate numerous arguments people make because I've already considered them all and found a refutation. I totally understand a spur of the moment suicide should not be encouraged for obvious reasons, but for others like me; the circumstances are different and it arguably will not change due to a combination of mental and circumstantial factors.

Before I jump into anything I just want to recognize: I understand that I am very privileged and that my reasons to die would be trivial at best. I was recently called a loser for having the mindset that I have, which I understand, because it's true: I lost at life and now I'm talking the shortcut out. I guess my life has been so shallow to this point that these problems are enough to get me, but I'm too tired to even bother defending my ego.

First of all, the fact that suicide is an inherently selfish act is true, just like every thing else we do. Yes, me wanting to die to ""feel better,"" is selfish I suppose, but isn't just like ignoring a toxic person &amp; moving far, far away? Yes, I recognize I'm hurting people around me, but my logic is: those people hurt me first by making me feel this way and they are continuing to also be selfish by keeping me here in pain.

I also want to recognize that my circumstances will not get better because of my mental set. Unhappiness aggregates. Though I know I have been happy and I can be fleetingly happy in the future, we humans have been evolutionarily programmed to see pretty much only the negative. I *can't* imagine a time when I was happy in the past-- and trust me I know I have been happy. It's just that I'm afraid of the pain that's inevitably going to come and none of the ups in life can ever compare.

Finally, I think me being alive won't amount to much. Sure, if I really tried I could do something with myself. But do I really want to go through that effort? There's no benefit to me doing anything really. If I become a famous actor or a scientist, nothing would change. I'd still end up 6 feet under whether now or 60 years later. I've been told this nihilist attitude will get me nowhere, but based on those principles so will changing my attitude too.

Suicide a shortcut. We've beat the system. People will always complain and societal stigmas stemming from an evolutionary background will always persist. But who cares? We won't be around to hear their complaints if everything works out.

I just wish I could have been at this point when I didn’t have to factor the holidays into my timing. Because I literally cannot wait much longer. 

So, my question is this: in terms of the long-term mental health of my family/friends, which would be more damaging, 1) doing it sometime between thanksgiving and Xmas, or 2) doing it in between Xmas and the start of the next semester in late Jan? Or, does it even matter which I choose? Either way I see the holidays being all but permanently ruined for my family in the future, and I would like y’all’s advice.

There's a quote I heard that's pretty fitting, I'm friendly with all but friends with few. 

My best friend, one of my only friends actually, started seeing someone new and it created some space between us. Jealous of that time shared with someone else I acted out and now there's a rift that seems too large to bridge. It's like they just picked up with someone else and that's it, I'm hurt and feel so alone.

I've noticed myself imagining the unthinkable to mitigate the constant pain. I'm afraid that I'll let myself get into a bad headspace and actually go through with it if I keep allowing those thoughts to pass unchecked. 

I see it playing out very vividly and feel a brief relief, then start to think about my brother who I know it would be incredibly hard on. If it wasn't for him I don't even know what I'd do or where I'd be right now.  

If something ever happened to him what the fuck is stopping me then, I wonder.

I've been thinking about getting a dog. A big slobbering loving dog that wags it's tail when I come home and jumps in my lap to be close if I sit down.

I don't feel close with anyone anymore, and it's starting to hit hard. I don't feel an innate sense of purpose and my life feels unfulfilled. I want a family but loathe the idea of ""searching"" for a life partner, and it's hard to dive into other things like work or new projects when a family is what I want the most. Everything else seems like a waste of time. I want to be needed for me as a human, not what I can provide or purchase with my skills or the fortune that's been bestowed upon me. 

Such first world problems I know. I'm fortunate to be able to go to the beach pretty much any day I'd like, travel places most only dream about, and purchase things that are ridiculously expensive. 

None of that shit matters to me and I'll always secretly wonder if people genuinely like me for me or if they just like me for what I bring to the table in terms of materialistic pleasures and/or financial security. 

Just feeling really jaded about life and the connections we make with others. I've got one friend who I know will be there for me no matter what, extravant lifestyle or that of a pouper doesn't matter. Is it selfish to say I need more than just one friend who I can trust like that? 

If I get a dog I figure that'll give me a good 10+ years to sort out these fucked up thoughts I've been having.

I’ve made a few posts on this sub venting and such but i have stayed off it recently and thought it was time to go back to tell my tale so here it is

On October 27th i attempted suicide. I took 30 Percocet and attempted to OD. I texted some friends in a group chat and basically told them what i was doing and saying sorry and all that. One of them told their moms and their mom told mine. the worst part of it was my moms face when i told her what i did. so she called 911 and i got in an ambulance to the ER. When i got there i basically found out all the percs were expired so nothing happened. I woke up and they had me go to a separate building so the psych ward or mental hospital. It was your basic psych ward. i had a cool roommate. most of my day was spent playing cards and such. it was the teen place so it was pretty fun to hang out and talk with other kids your age about your experience and what happened. I’m 16 for reference. After that was over i got prescribed anti depressants specifically prozac. then i started the PHP program for teens as well. this was the same thing with support groups but you don’t sleep there. this was actually a lot more boring at it’s mainly just lessons. but it wasn’t all bad since i got my dick sucked in the bathroom. the girls there are wild lemme tell you. but that’s that and now i’m out of that and starting to go back to normal. still depressed but suicidal thoughts have gone away for now. but i’ve started cutting so that’s not good i guess.

,SuicideWatch,"First time posting here, but this is something that I have been struggling with for a long time and I want to get it off my chest (at least a little).

Some backstory: I'm an Asian male, 160cm tall and in my late teens. I was born premature and have been struggling with health concerns through most of my life, however none of the pain from surgeries or parental pressure ever bothered me, compared to my height. My height is the one, vivid defining factor that dictated my relationships, school life, confidence, etc. 

Ever since my peers started outgrowing me, the casual ridicule from people (good people, who often don't even know how much their words or jokes hurt) about my height slowly whittled away at my confidence and self esteem. I have always been social and outgoing, and play numerous sports, but those all too often are placed on the back-seat as compared to my height. It seems like no matter what I do, nothing can ever traverse the chasm between my height and that of my peers, and the sheer lack of respect people have for me due to my height has resulted in me slowly becoming more and more depressed over time. Relationships have been few and far between, and I am ashamed to say the experiences I've had as well as the countless comments from women (often casually) about my height has resulted in me having a low opinion of them in general, and thus affecting my empathy for them. Nowadays, I only look for hookups and casual sex, the thought that I could never be enough for someone due to my height being so deeply ingrained in me I've stopped thinking of having any emotional connection to women.

Nowadays, I go out, socialize, party etc but inside, no matter how many friends I make, how f**ed up I get at parties, how much fun I have, I can't stop feeling hollow inside, and angry that I couldn't at least be born average height, even just a little taller. 

The worst part of it all is the fact that I was even lucky enough to be born with good features, and just had to get the short end of the stick (literally) with my height. 
So many times I've heard comments like ""He's kinda hot, but his height..."" or ""I'd smash if he was taller."" I've even considered limb lengthening surgery but that's really the only driving force I have right now, the prospect of one day being regarded as a real human being compared to the midget I am right now being absolutely amazing. 

I use various drugs to numb myself to my feelings, but those brief flashes of happiness soon fade in the light of reality - that nothing I do will ever really help, even limb lengthening will only make me slightly taller at best. I wear insoles to increase my height, and with my height being so short, they help me be regarded as an equal at least by girls, and even guys. I can't be taken seriously or as a male by a lot of my fair weather friends, and honestly have been considering just ending it all sooner or later rather than struggle through life being mocked and disregarded for something I couldn't control.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe its a cry for help, maybe I'm just frustrated and this is me venting. If I try too hard at stuff and be competitive I'm ""compensating for something"", if I get into a relationship oftentimes girls' girlfriends, etc will give them peer pressure to stop dating me after realizing my height, and ridicule me constantly behind my back. The amount of times something good was broken apart due to this is crazy - an example being how one of my closest friends, someone I thought I could connect with during my highschool years completely ghosted me and cut off contact due to her friends making fun of me and her for talking to me. This hurt especially because I had been there for her when she was going through a lot previously, and wasn't even trying to get into a relationship, but the sheer fact that me, a short guy, could ever be worth talking to seemed to fly over most of her friends' heads. This incident in particular is what caused a lot of my current self destructive behaviour, not caring about university, just going out and getting f**ed up every night to feel alive, hooking up with prostitutes and talking to them, finding them better friends than most of the 'normal' women I know, too.

I rolled the car and the airbags didn't go off so I have a carotid neck injury and will need CT scans every 6 months for a few years. I'm now a stroke risk during covid. I also am on the brink of being diagnosed with cervical cancer I got from HPV from a rape over a decade ago and have been monitoring since.

My family was incredibly abusive. My sisters use to beat and spit on me. My brother choked me unconscious and threw frying oil on me. He also stole acid once from my dad's chemistry lab and sprayed it on me and those are just a few greatest hits.

My partner is a complete douche bag and porn addict. I hate him so much sometimes. Because I'm sober, as is he, for the first time in years everything is harder. Does he care? Fuck no. I interrupted a stupid fucking story about how he hates going out (no shit we do nothing together) in the car Thursday because we got home and I wanted to pet a sweet cat that comes by the house. I asked 4 times if I could get out and he just kept talking so I apparently blurted out ""stop talking so I can get out...you're going to scare the cat away"". Cue 2 straight days of the silent treatment because ""he was so taken aback by ""stop talking"". So ""rude and disrespectful"".

Thing is, this man could not be bothered to look up from his phone or console when you're speaking. I have PTSD and have repeats of the things my family did to me often. The other day I was talking about how I wasn't doing ok that day because my mom had been texting me even though we're not talking, brought up the acid story and he NEVER looked up from his phone. When I told him he should chill about the ""stop talking"" if I can manage him not bothering to look up or say a goddamn word when I'm talking about my traumas and he goes ""I'm sorry but how many times are you going to tell that story"".

He just got a talking to at work by HR because of the way he talks to women. He sees nothing he does as wrong. I have no way out of this relationship and have no family worth contacting for help.

Tonight I just started walking towards farmland and was going to either stuff my pockets with rocks and try the creek or if that wasn't deep enough then at least I'd be soaked and hypothermia would set in quick as it was around freezing.

,SuicideWatch,"I will attempt to be quick, clear, and concise.

I'm a 35M, married, had two kids, one boy one girl. My son would be 11 today and my daughter would turn 4 in February. 

I've battled heroin addiction and alcoholism since I was 19. I've had periods of sobriety- 3 years clean twice.  Months countless other times. I haven't drank in 4 years. I'm not especially proud of that because it was one of the easiest things I've ever done - stopping drinking - I didn't miss it, didn't give two shits about alcohol. 

I've ruined lives. My parents are amazing people. They've dedicated their golden years to seeing me go in and out of rehab, I went to prison once, I'm just awful. They never stopped rooting for me.

My wife. God she's a saint. Before she met me the worst thing she did was smoke a cigarette. She received a BS in Elementary Education. She taught special education. I made her try heroin. I'm the worst. She resisted for so long. She still lived for so long. I made her try heroin. Heroin didn't let go.

My mom is a retired teacher. My father is a CFO. He is a CPA. I've been riding his coattails for years. Perhaps he enabled me. That doesn't matter now. He's 74 and still working. He will probably never retire. It's my fault. I'm the worst. I've cost that man 200k by my calculations. Its probably far higher. He will never leave me. I wish he would.

My sister is/was a heroin addict. She's been clean for a decade. She won't talk to me. My family is fractured because of me. I have three nieces and a nephew.  They still love me but they probably shouldn't.  My sister still won't talk to me. She's probably the smartest out of them all. Dump me early. Stand your ground.

I need love. Now more than ever. I finally have a better grasp on my addiction than I ever have. It doesn't matter. Its too late. I've ruined everything good I've ever had. I have nothing. I want to die. I've made my peace with life.

I burnt all my bridges. Cant find a heroin dealer that will sell to me. Totally meant to do that but I figured my life would get better. Wish I could still cross those bridges. 

Cant drive my car into a wall or a semi or something else that will kill me. At this point, this immaculate 10k car is the only thing I could leave my family. I have no assets and no life insurance. Heroin saw to that. 

I'm a felon so I cant own a gun. 

Hanging seems awful. 

I'm not going to drown myself.

,SuicideWatch,"I have no social skills, I can’t initiate conversations I can’t maintain or make friendships I struggle to find things to say when I’m alone with another person. Growing up I was always the smart and quiet one, and now I’m just the weird, isolated, soon to be burnout one. All my closest friends from high school, most of which I became friends with in grade school or were introduced to by my grade school friends all went to college together while I decided to go to a college that has a better computer science program. This past semester I have had a couple opportunities to make new friends and I did t take them because I didn’t know what to do. My whole life I have never been the one to initiate hanging out even if I wanted to. I either never let any of my personality out or I’m just fucking obnoxious and insufferable. I realize that my future is one of loneliness, never finding friends or a life partner. I crave social interaction. I want to hang out with people, make new friends, go to parties and just have the overall “college experience”, or at least have one with a couple friends in it. I have only enjoyed three days this semester and those were when i visited my friends at their college. It alleviated my (irrational) fear that they would replace me, but made me realize that they are living the life I can only dream of. Those 3 days I felt like a real person. I want to interact with people but I don’t know how, I don’t know how to make conversation or small talk or just talk to friends. Even if I got rid of the social anxiety magically I still don’t have the social skills or habits to make and maintain friends. This is why I realized I have no hope. I thought that I just need therapy or medication to get rid of the anxiety (haven’t tried but I know it’s pointless bc of the aforementioned lack of social skills), but it’s all just fucking hopeless. The depression has seriously affected my college grades. I graduated as a valedictorian, 36 ACT, many APs credits and classes. I just can’t do schoolwork right now, but I can’t stop because then the feeling that my life is so quickly passing by me will intensify even more, which will just worsen the situation.

Growing up I was always the smart and quiet one, and now I’m just the weird, isolated, soon to be burnout one. All my closest friends from high school, most of which I became friends with in grade school or were introduced to by my grade school friends all went to college together while I decided to go to a college that has a better computer science program. This past semester I have had a couple opportunities to make new friends and I did t take them because I didn’t know what to do. My whole life I have never been the one to initiate hanging out even if I wanted to. I either never let any of my personality out or I’m just fucking obnoxious and insufferable. I realize that my future is one of loneliness, never finding friends or a life partner. I crave social interaction. I want to hang out with people, make new friends, go to parties and just have the overall “college experience”, or at least have one with a couple friends in it. I have only enjoyed three days this semester and those were when i visited my friends at their college. It alleviated my (irrational) fear that they would replace me, but made me realize that they are living the life I can only dream of. Those 3 days I felt like a real person. I want to interact with people but I don’t know how, I don’t know how to make conversation or small talk or just talk to friends. Even if I got rid of the social anxiety magically I still don’t have the social skills or habits to make and maintain friends. This is why I realized I have no hope. I thought that I just need therapy or medication to get rid of the anxiety (haven’t tried but I know it’s pointless bc of the aforementioned lack of social skills), but it’s all just fucking hopeless. The depression has seriously affected my college grades. I graduated as a valedictorian, 36 ACT, many APs credits and classes. I just can’t do schoolwork right now, but I can’t stop because then the feeling that my life is so quickly passing by me will intensify even more, which will just worsen the situation. There’s no fucking point to living. The only reason I am alive is because elf the naive hope that I have always had that things will get better if I do xyz or by random chance (things have never gotten better), and because I can’t bear the pain I would cause to my loved ones.

,SuicideWatch,"2020 has been one awful year in our household. Setback after setback, endlessly working with no savings to show for it, and the loss of loved ones. My girlfriend and I are typically happy, but this past year has rotted much of our relationship. I don't have much of a spine, so I typically cry, shut down, or resort to being a doormat when it's been a bad day. My gf however has a temper, she yells, screams, swears to the point my neighbours have approached me about it, and when she can't possibly rage anymore she breaks down into having sobbing and suicidal ideation. This makes support difficult because all the yelling has a way of making me clam up and my heart to feel sore, and it all reminds me too well of my childhood home growing up. While my dad never hit me, he had a volume which would bring me to tears, and my reaction to my partner's anger is much the same. I myself struggle with depression and spent a stay in an MH ward last year for a suicide attempt, so naturally my support for her usually includes what I found helped me, mainly professional help, having someone to talk to who was detached from the situation, medication, and for her specifically, working on her temper issues.

All of this she rejects. She refuses medication, she distrusts mental health professionals, and makes empty promises about dealing with her anger. I'm worried because she has a family history of suicide that she's at great risk of following through if the day is bad enough. Her reasons mostly come from low self esteem about her appearance, unemployment, or the feeling of getting nowhere. She's my best friend and I love her and I just want to see her happy, but I'm all alone in helping and I'm pathetic help. I want her to get help because I'm scared if my efforts aren't good enough, I could lose her. She doesn't have anything in the way of a professional diagnosis, but her mood swings between crying and angered screaming at the slightest frustrations make me think there might be something she's been ignoring for a long time.

I appreciate you caring, Alex. Because you care, I need to make something clear to you...Please, be aware that your good intentions can cause harm. 

I was made aware that you went on Evie's live show and said something to her about me killing myself? I NEVER said that I would kill myself. Please remember that I'm a real person. Just because YOU MISUNDERSTAND what I'm saying, doesn't mean you can choose to use your free will to confuse others. 

Please, be careful what you say. I am not suicidal. I did NOT say I would kill myself during my stream. If you cannot understand my sarcasm, please check with me first. I speak with LOTS of sarcasm. If you want literal responses, you should ask for them. 

You can cause serious harm by misunderstanding my words and worrying my friends, or others. 

Again, I know you DONT mean to misunderstand, but it's very harmful for you to quote me saying things I NEVER SAID in any literal sense.

You're an adult and I will treat you as one. So, please take this message as me defending my rights to be able to speak for myself. You do not speak for me or my mental health. Ever.  Leave my friends alone.

I’m a patron of hers and if you don’t know who she is as a Youtuber and she’s had a history of attempts and near-attempts. What she said is that if Biden installs a mask mandate she’d do it (nonvoting hardcore constitutionalist). As someone who has worked for a crises clinic, I am of the belief that you should always reach out to friends when someone is suicidal even if you don’t know them personally and sometimes she says she’s being sarcastic when she’s not.

He got up to get me another drink (after I declined) I got up to use the bathroom and while I was at it I told the bartender not to let me leave with him, that he was making me uncomfortable.

After he left I went outside to wait on a friend to pick me up but I thought they bailed because it was getting late, my phone had died hours earlier.

,SuicideWatch,"A couple of months ago I started contemplating suicide because of a certain issue. During that time, certain things happened and it almost feels as if God is trying to tell me to kill myself.

I was once on the Youtube homepage, and I clicked on a song suggestion. The song was ' West End Girls ' by the Pet Shop Boys. The first line of that song is '' Sometimes you're better off dead, if there's a gun in your house aim it at your head ''. I immediately closed the song.

I'm not sure if this happened on the same day, but it happened close to that time. I was again on Youtube, and I saw a thumbnail for a song suggestion. "" God was never on your side '' by Motorhead.

Despite being a Motorhead fan, I had never heard that song before. The reason why this title struck me so hard was because earlier this year, something happened which caused me to believe that the exact opposite was in place. That God was on my side because something positive had happened and I was feeling very thankful. But that positive thing turned negative a few months ago, which is what caused me to become suicidal. And I feel like this song suggestion was like a '' Haha gotcha loser '' message from God.

I have gotten a few other moments like that. Where I've seen things which eerily remind me of my situation. And what I've seen has always involved the element of death. I feel like God is laughing at me up there and is turning my life into a joke.

Just recently, I've been struggling with the idea that no matter what I try in my life, it always ends up in failure. Then this evening I was listening to an old Joe Rogan episode where he was talking about some credit card thief who went to a casino to gamble and Joe's exact words were '' This guy was a perpetual loser. He just couldn't win! '' And then his guest made a joke about how he should have jumped off a bridge. 

That's the exact same thought I was dealing with that day. The fact that no matter what I try, I always fail.

I'm not even that religious. I'm agnostic but I've always leaned towards the idea that there might be some universal power out there.

Hello, everyone.

My mental health has been rapidly declining over the past week.

I relapsed on Sunday after 1 1/2 years of being clean. Since then everything became so numb again.

When I found my suicide note from June there was no emotion connected to it. I don't feel anymore.

The only time I feel genuinely happy is when I talk to a certain friend. He is the only one that knows about my sh and I feel like I don't need to hide around him.

But I know that he means much more to me than I do to him. He is always so helpful while I'm just kinda there.

He knows that I was suicidal in June but I told him that I was fine now. Which was a lie. I have been suicidal since Tuesday. Still am.

The thing is, I don't want to die.

But I know that I can't stop it by myself.

The reasonable thing would be to ask my friend for help. But I don't want to be manipulative or bother him. I don't even know if he considers me a friend. He has some mental issues himself and I am scared of making it worse for him. I also don't know how he could even help me. I already am in therapy and going to a mental hospital is no option right now.

,SuicideWatch,"I don’t know where to start. I’m 22 years old and have been feeling an inevitable doom over my shoulders for some time now. When I was 17 I literally woke up one morning and didn’t feel right. Not as in a depressive episode or a panic attack, but as if I was still dreaming. A light foggy feeling in my head. I was depressed at the time due to isolating myself from others and not attempting to have a social life, but it’s been nothing compared to what it has been lately. As time went on the foggy feeling only got worse. I thought to myself “its only temporary, by the time your 20 it will be long gone” but I’m 22 now and it’s more present than ever.

I have a 1 year old daughter and a beautiful girlfriend. I have a decent car and a house to live in. Everything that I need I can provide for myself. I don’t know why I feel how I do. I try so hard to hide how I feel from my girlfriend and daughter, but I feel I need to let her know sometime soon. I’ve tried getting help but when it comes to it I can’t help but hide how I really feel. I have convinced myself that if I let anybody know exactly what’s going on I will be hospitalized. I have to much on my plate for me to not be able to work and be with my family right now. My brother is currently in jail involving the death of his infant son last September. His wife was pregnant when he got arrested and after she gave birth I was contacted by the department of human services and asked if my girlfriend and I would be able to care for their newborn daughter. We immediately said yes.

My little sister has been in and out of foster homes for a couple years. Last year I finally had myself together enough to be able to take her into my custody. I learned shortly after she moved in with us that she was pregnant. She gave birth a week after my brothers baby was born.

I now have a daughter of my own, my girlfriend, my niece and nephew, and my little sister that I have to be able to provide for. So I feel taking a break for my mental health is off the table right now. To them I try to make it seem like nothing is going on. But I’m reality I’m barley hanging on. To them I appear normal and healthy.

I feel incredibly isolated and trapped inside my own head. I’ve been feeling paranoid lately as well and it’s the worse thing that I’ve been through. The thought of suicide has been becoming more and more casual for me to think about. I never want to kill myself and I never thought I would, but I’m feeling so disconnected from reality I fear it’s the only way out. I dont think I would be able to, but with how I’m feeling recently I become more unsure every day. I work a third shift job Monday through Saturday so Sunday nights I’m all alone. When I get off work I spend an hour or two with my family and then tell them I’m tired and need to go to bed, but I can’t sleep. I lay awake in bed and toss and turn for hours until I finally fall asleep, leaving me with 4-5 hours of sleep before work. I try to sleep with my girlfriend on Sunday nights but I can never sleep for more than an hour. I’ve been having terrible nightmares every Sunday. I wake up feeling dreadful and scared, I don’t know why. I go into the living room and try to watch tv and clean the house, but that does little to help how I’m feeling. I’m scared that one day on a Monday morning my family will wake up and find me dead in the basement, without ever knowing why. I think about how it would affect my family, and the depression, guilt, and anger it would bring them, and it’s enough to stop me.

,SuicideWatch,"suicide isn't Wrong or we just don't care. its proven by how we treat it  
suicide prevention isn't about care. its about money and a pat on the back. always has been and always will be.

we use guilt and others feelings to say why its wrong. which actually proves the person is right NOT wrong. if you can't think of one reason it would help them you likely are wrong in saying they shouldnt and also likely wrong they are truly helping others. (if they can't help themself they can't help others we actually teach this {can't fill from empty cup} )  


next we make false promises. it gets better. no statistically it gets worse not better #sorrynotsorry it was a mis-informed program for bulling in schools and it actually failed even for that. stop spreading it.  
we make other promises but don't personally verify or have anyway to make sure they have a reasonable chance of being true. STOP DOING THIS! you prove their suicide was right. and that you lied. last thing you need when you need them to trust you. #don'tmakeapromiseyoucantkeep  


stop making it a actual CRIME to attempt suicide. great proof there its not about helping but money. YES look it up is is a crime in the books or used to be. but the successful completion is not.  


AND MOST IMPORTANTLY if they say its FINANCIAL related the ABSOLUTE WORSE THING YOU CAN DO is to GIVE them ANOTHER BILL... that means the WORST POSSIBLE thing is to call the cops on them.  
you an't cute. you aint doing the right thing. your teaching them A: you don't care about legal or financial issues for them. B: that prob makes them more suicidal and more likely to attempt.  
C: its a dick move and proof the healthcare system and mental isnt about saving lives BUT making money.  


remember its NOT asked for by the person, non consent treatment. PROVEN to not be medically necessary in majority of cases and actually more likely to cause harm. WHY THE F$&amp;$&amp;&amp;$ should i have to pay one dime for it. oh yeah because its a LEGAL thing not even a medical and untill after the asseement its more less practicing medicine without a license.

you want to save someone form suicide DON""T EVER CALL 911 on them. you 100% of the time do not improve the situation this has been proven. you can't stop them from doing it. and you WILL 100% of the time lose a friend for it. and make them for up to 3 months MORE likely to actually die then before.    


\^\^\^ needs to be teached rather than the outdated lie.  if you really want to help BE there in person. otherwise you can't help by a phone call to police. which for some groups that alone can make sure you can find out the person died instead. some like LGBT and POC actually that alone is the most likely to end up with them dead by the police.   


better yet if you don't even know if they are at work or home DON""T FRI\*ING CALL. i was pulled out of work and lost pay and socked with a 2.5K medical bill you don't think i was less. i actually attempted AFTER that when i had no intent before.

suicide prevention isn&amp;#39;t about care. its about money and a pat on the back. always has been and always will be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;we use guilt and others feelings to say why its wrong. which actually proves the person is right NOT wrong. if you can&amp;#39;t think of one reason it would help them you likely are wrong in saying they shouldnt and also likely wrong they are truly helping others. (if they can&amp;#39;t help themself they can&amp;#39;t help others we actually teach this {can&amp;#39;t fill from empty cup} )  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;next we make false promises. it gets better. no statistically it gets worse not better #sorrynotsorry it was a mis-informed program for bulling in schools and it actually failed even for that. stop spreading it.&lt;br/&gt;
we make other promises but don&amp;#39;t personally verify or have anyway to make sure they have a reasonable chance of being true. STOP DOING THIS! you prove their suicide was right. and that you lied. last thing you need when you need them to trust you. #don&amp;#39;tmakeapromiseyoucantkeep  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;stop making it a actual CRIME to attempt suicide. great proof there its not about helping but money. YES look it up is is a crime in the books or used to be. but the successful completion is not.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AND MOST IMPORTANTLY if they say its FINANCIAL related the ABSOLUTE WORSE THING YOU CAN DO is to GIVE them ANOTHER BILL... that means the WORST POSSIBLE thing is to call the cops on them.&lt;br/&gt;
you an&amp;#39;t cute. you aint doing the right thing. your teaching them A: you don&amp;#39;t care about legal or financial issues for them. B: that prob makes them more suicidal and more likely to attempt.&lt;br/&gt;
C: its a dick move and proof the healthcare system and mental isnt about saving lives BUT making money.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;remember its NOT asked for by the person, non consent treatment. PROVEN to not be medically necessary in majority of cases and actually more likely to cause harm. WHY THE F$&amp;amp;$&amp;amp;&amp;amp;$ should i have to pay one dime for it. oh yeah because its a LEGAL thing not even a medical and untill after the asseement its more less practicing medicine without a license. (the cop isnt trained for this; many require a medical doctor to interact, but most don&amp;#39;t actually do this)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;you want to save someone form suicide DON&amp;quot;T EVER CALL 911 on them. you 100% of the time do not improve the situation this has been proven. you can&amp;#39;t stop them from doing it. and you WILL 100% of the time lose a friend for it. and make them for up to 3 months MORE likely to actually die then before.    &lt;/p&gt;

Then that September hit, I’ve smoked cannabis every day except for 3 days since then. Usually in the evening before bed, but at some points 3-4 times a day.

,SuicideWatch,"I lurk this subreddit a lot because it honestly astounds me how I don’t know what it feels like to be depressed, suicidal, unhinged and the like.

However for the first time this week I experienced this feeling. I won’t go in depth, but a relapse of a certain drug caused me to feel like I was... not belonging in this world. I looked back at all the absurd messages I sent to friends (and strangers) and I only feel guilt and shame. Eventually I’ll start feeling better by as time goes by but even with friends around me, everytime I wake up the cycle of emptiness resets. This is my 4th day in this cycle.

While I’m a little more stable now, I can finally admit that I understand what a lot of you are going through right now. Some of you might have it way worse than me.

&lt;p&gt;However for the first time this week I experienced this feeling. I won’t go in depth, but a relapse of a certain drug caused me to feel like I was... not belonging in this world. I looked back at all the absurd messages I sent to friends (and strangers) and I only feel guilt and shame. Eventually I’ll start feeling better by as time goes by but even with friends around me, everytime I wake up the cycle of emptiness resets. This is my 4th day in this cycle.&lt;/p&gt;

Nobody. I never had a special someone. That's why im here. I have nobody to talk to about my problems. 

My parents, my father always calls me lazy, idiot, a mess. I had a dream to be a pilot. This is what he says about it ""that face? Pilot?"". I am now studying aircraft engineering. It's not going well. My first semester was solid then corona hit. My second semester was on online classes and it's fucked. I understood nothing. Im stressed. I want to postpone my studies but my father refused.(costs him money, why spend on your kid when you can buy 10k watches?!)  he blamed me for my performance. He's right tho. I started sleeping less during thw night, more during the day. Play games so i can forget who i am. Stay in my room as long as i could. What do my parents say about this? They tell me im lazy, stupid, a mess, a failure. Compared me to my siblings, to their friends childrens.

&lt;p&gt;My parents, my father always calls me lazy, idiot, a mess. I had a dream to be a pilot. This is what he says about it &amp;quot;that face? Pilot?&amp;quot;. I am now studying aircraft engineering. It&amp;#39;s not going well. My first semester was solid then corona hit. My second semester was on online classes and it&amp;#39;s fucked. I understood nothing. Im stressed. I want to postpone my studies but my father refused.(costs him money, why spend on your kid when you can buy 10k watches?!)  he blamed me for my performance. He&amp;#39;s right tho. I started sleeping less during thw night, more during the day. Play games so i can forget who i am. Stay in my room as long as i could. What do my parents say about this? They tell me im lazy, stupid, a mess, a failure. Compared me to my siblings, to their friends childrens. &lt;/p&gt;

I've always been extremely depressed and suicidal. In recent years, I joined Discord and met a bunch of wonderful friends on a particular community. I've been very attached to this community, and the owner, while initially bad at running it, has slowly been getting better than better, and the community has been improving more and more as a result. In a way, that community that I use as my escape constantly getting better and better over time felt almost motivating. My escape is improving, it's even more enjoyable to use it, maybe I can get through this?

About half a year ago, they were permanently banned. This was part of the 'community constantly improving' that I talked about earlier. The ban was well recieved, and the community felt so much nicer to use. My escape really felt like a comforting place where I could hide from the pains of the real world. It was comforting. I relied on it.

Today, the owner unbanned them. I feel so betrayed. We're very close friends. I can't believe she would do something like this. Something I had become dependent on has been ripped away from me. I feel like I have nothing, no outlet, nothing to save myself anymore. 

And I feel even worse about feeling this way in the first place. It's just her doing what she thinks is right, it's not like she was trying to hurt me. I understand that. I feel selfish. I feel like I'm using my hatred for a person as an excuse. I don't know anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"Recently, I lost someone very important to me, someone I met on Discord, a Polish girl that I became very close with for three weeks, for those three weeks, I was very happy, I was very interested in her, and she was very interested in me, every morning, she'd send me a message asking how I was, we'd talk about anything that were on hour minds, sorrows, innermost thoughts, and our dreams and goals, we were very attentive towards each other, she had a COVID situation at home and I was constantly asking if she's feeling any symptoms, fearing that I may lose her, once I drove to the beach because she said she wanted pictures, and I drove 40 minutes to the beach just so I can take some pictures to send to her, we'd send each other voice messages sometimes, when words couldn't describe what we want to express, also I often share pictures of my meals with her, all in all, because I felt as if I found my soulmate, someone I felt valued by, someone very close to me, and I was no longer lonely, I was no longer suicidal.

But if you're reading this, you're probably wondering why I'm writing, well, good things never last, because I suffer from a wide range of mental issues, specifically trust issues, and fear of abandonment, my senses became heightened to the peak when it comes to detecting anything that can perceived as a sign of she starting to dislike me or distrusting me or leaving me, two days ago, she said she wanted to share her Instagram with me, we have already sent a lot of pics of ourselves to each other by then, but then she sort of withdrew the idea, I felt that our bond and trust we had for each other is threatened, and I started to feel distant to her, the next day, she was replying very late to my messages and I felt worrisome, later, she sent a screenshot where she was having a conversation with someone where she sent several voice messages, saying that she feels sorry for her friend that they have to listen to her rants, again, I felt that like I was being replaced and I couldn't even admit to her how I feel, because I know I'm being pathetic, and irrational.

Unfortunately, that night, we argued, and fought about pointless things, time and time again I insinuated my fear that we're not close anymore, at the end of it, she said to me ""If you don't want to talk to me anymore, tell me and I'll never message you again"", as I saw that statement, I was hurt, I wondered if our past three weeks meant anything to her, for her to say something like this, that wasn't what I wanted at all, I felt that my trust issues was real, and my fear of abandonment demanded that I must push her away from before she has a chance to leave me, and as such, on an impulse, I said to her ""Don't ever message me again"", even though deep now, I know I didn't meant it, and then I unfriended her. That night, I couldn't sleep, I was suffering from harshest depression I had in years for hours, in the morning, I couldn't eat, I was still thinking about her, I was wondering if I have gone too far, I was wondering if she's crying, I was wondering if this friendship can be fixed.

After talking with few friends about my situation, they recommended that I reconcile, I knew I had to talk to her again, and I will attempt to put things right. When I added her again, she didn't accept it, which prompted me to add her twice, only then she accepted, I wrote about how I was sorry and I was hurt, and I wished that we can work on this, because I still value her, unfortunately, she was cold, and distant, she didn't really want to talk to me, and she insinuated that our relationship was toxic, and if we continue it, then we'll just argue again, I knew by then that, I was no longer anything of worth in her eyes, the damage is done, and we're now what I feared the most in the beginning, that we'd become apart. So I said to her ""You're heartless, is our past three weeks all a joke to you?"", for she replied ""WTF, I'm heartless, right, it was all a joke, right, I was staying up all night every night as a joke, I was checking in on you every day as a joke, I trusted you to tell you about my personal life as a joke, I tried to motivate you and make you feel happy as a joke, I even though once, that you're the type of person I could possibly fall in love with, nah sorry, it was a joke too"".

I couldn't even comprehend it, I didn't even read it word by word, I was simply hurt and I just wanted her to tell me that I'm still worthy, so I asked her ""Am I still important to you"", she said after that I called her heartless, no, I'm not. By then, I entered a defeatist mindset, I believed there's nothing else I could do, so I said goodbye to her, before she unfriended me, she left a message that I think I'll always remember, ""If it wasn't for your fucking trust issues, all of this wouldn't have happened"", as I read this, I realised, perhaps she's right, my trust issues ruined a lot of relationships, I was unable to commit to her, I was always doubting myself, I always feared that she may leave me one day. And the thing is, it happened, it happened because I believed it, not because I fear it. So my advice for everyone out there, wish for what you want, don't fear for what you don't want. Never say anything hurtful, if you're hurt, if you're angry, tell the person you value ""I really care about you and it's upsetting that we fight like this, I just want to let you know, I care a lot about our relationship and it's not where I'd like it to be and I'd like to make it better so can we talk about it?""

&lt;p&gt;But if you&amp;#39;re reading this, you&amp;#39;re probably wondering why I&amp;#39;m writing, well, good things never last, because I suffer from a wide range of mental issues, specifically trust issues, and fear of abandonment, my senses became heightened to the peak when it comes to detecting anything that can perceived as a sign of she starting to dislike me or distrusting me or leaving me, two days ago, she said she wanted to share her Instagram with me, we have already sent a lot of pics of ourselves to each other by then, but then she sort of withdrew the idea, I felt that our bond and trust we had for each other is threatened, and I started to feel distant to her, the next day, she was replying very late to my messages and I felt worrisome, later, she sent a screenshot where she was having a conversation with someone where she sent several voice messages, saying that she feels sorry for her friend that they have to listen to her rants, again, I felt that like I was being replaced and I couldn&amp;#39;t even admit to her how I feel, because I know I&amp;#39;m being pathetic, and irrational.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, that night, we argued, and fought about pointless things, time and time again I insinuated my fear that we&amp;#39;re not close anymore, at the end of it, she said to me &amp;quot;If you don&amp;#39;t want to talk to me anymore, tell me and I&amp;#39;ll never message you again&amp;quot;, as I saw that statement, I was hurt, I wondered if our past three weeks meant anything to her, for her to say something like this, that wasn&amp;#39;t what I wanted at all, I felt that my trust issues was real, and my fear of abandonment demanded that I must push her away from before she has a chance to leave me, and as such, on an impulse, I said to her &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t ever message me again&amp;quot;, even though deep now, I know I didn&amp;#39;t meant it, and then I unfriended her. That night, I couldn&amp;#39;t sleep, I was suffering from harshest depression I had in years for hours, in the morning, I couldn&amp;#39;t eat, I was still thinking about her, I was wondering if I have gone too far, I was wondering if she&amp;#39;s crying, I was wondering if this friendship can be fixed.&lt;/p&gt;

About 5 or 6 months back, I found out that my girlfriend had started cutting herself, a couple months later, she's diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. I've been trying to support her for the entirety of the time that I've known about it, and it's slowly building up and draining me. I've had two suicide attempts, both complete failures.

Lately she's seemed distant, and I feel like she doesn't love or care about me anymore, and that her friends are more important to her than I am, even though we've planned out our future together, and even named our children. School has been slowly overburdening me, as it's genuinely gotten to the point where I feel like I'm drowning in assignments, and I can't do anything about it due to the severe lack of motivation my unbearable depression has caused me. My parents are both very disappointed in me, and think that I'm just a huge waste of time. I can't get out of bed every morning, and when I do, I wish I had a gun to shoot myself with, without a second thought. The only reason I'm still alive is out of fear that my girlfriend would do something to herself she can't undo. I stay up and get little to no sleep every night trying to both support her and try and get my projects done and submitted in time. I just wanna be relieved of my stress, I can't do this anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"I'm really struggling with killing myself right now.  Just got out of jail for domestic violence, I won't get into the details.  Basically it boils down to, I have been struggling with alcoholism due to PTSD (mil vet), anxiety and depression for the last 10 years, and my wife encouraged me to try her anti-depressant to try and help me.  So I started using it, but it's definitely just an element to my problem, not really the root or biggest deal.  For the entire time I was with my wife, I had a habit of going manic, depressive, but not usually suicidal.  Once in a while I would express it, but reason verbally that my kids keep me going.  


3 months into this drug, citalopram, and one of my manic episodes turned into a very serious attempt at suicide.  There was a family trigger with my father, my wife got scared and called the cops.  Then I was into full panic.  I have a few pending custody issues going on that I know a domestic violence charge would completely obfuscate my position, and I instantly ran for my gun safe to try and kill myself to make what I considered at the time the best possible outcome for my wife to keep my daughter in her custody rather than my daughter going to my ex's family (their family is on record for sexually molesting her as an infant, but CPS cares more about the very provable alcoholism that I had at the time and had no interest in protecting my daughter from her predatory, might I say evil, family...luckily the law was on my side in the end and after much fighting/legal fees)  


Anyway, I am in no way excusing my behavior, just trying to understand it.  My wife perceives me trying to take the phone away from her while she was calling the cops to stop me from being suicidal as assault, which she has every right to and I'm in no way trying to downplay.  Actually, that's the primary reason for my self-loathing.  


I absolutely love my wife.  I adore everything about her, I can't even think of 3 flaws she has off the top of my head.  In fact, the only thing I can think of is her patience and understanding.  Her compassion, her love, how hard she tried to help me get through my problems.  And now, 3 months into citalopram at her advice, I have finally put hands on another person, despite my absolute pacifistic core values.  I can neither understand how I acted that way, nor forgive myself for it.  My family and friends, with great reason, have chosen to excommunicate me to stand with her.  I would give them that same advice if they asked me what to do.  Nothing gives me more solace in knowing that her of all people is the person that will guide my children to adulthood.  


With all the circumstances that I face, if I was to try my best and power through this, I'm looking at 5-20 years in prison, and out of respect for my wife I will not fight any of it.  However, I am a very strong willed person, and I do not want to spend 20 years in a cage and watch my kids grow up through letters in the mail.  My wife finally drew a line in the sand, and I agree with her.  My kids do not need me around them growing up, even if I think I have some philosophical value to add to their rearing, and even my wife would probably agree that I'm a genius when it comes to non-physical discipline and education for them...but I will never forgive myself for forcefully trying to snatch the phone out of my wife's hand, and now that the law is involved, I'm afraid any optimism going forward is just hot air.  

I feel like if I was to remove myself from the picture now, before they get too old, would be best for them and me.  I'm an affliction to everything and everyone I've ever loved, and I've gone against my core principles and beliefs in a way that I can't understand.

,SuicideWatch,"I am 16 years old and plan to kill myself right before my final's results are released which is about 2 months from now. I have been abused by my father ever since i could remember and have had no one to share my problems with, especially since my mother left me when i was 4. I really really really really despise my father for everything he put me through and one of the many reasons i want to kill myself is precisely because I know he will suffer beacuse of it. My father is a gambling addict and I am tired of him venting his frustrations when he loses money upon me. We used to be decently rich but he gambled everything away to the point of bankruptcy and huge debts. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 12 which was right after he got out of jail for domestic abuse. My step-mother had attempted to take her own life in front of the family and it is honestly very traumatising. Not only that my father has been scolding his own dad (my grandfather) to the point that he admits he wants to die too. I think I am like this now because of the 8 months my father spent in jail. I tasted freedom for the 1st time in my life and my step mother opened my eyes to the abuse I was receiving. If i still thought the abuse was normal then maybe I could have been handling this better. Being born in an asian household, perhaps this is normal for many but I am seriously having trouble coping right now.

I am just too tired to continue living. As the eldest brother and most fluent english speaker, much responsibility and expectaions have been placed upon me and I am tired of helping. My father always needs me to do stuff for him (paying bills, filing tax) and on several occasions I am incapable of doing them, I would get scolded for being useless. How is that even reasonable, no school would teach about this stuff and him being 30+ years older than me means he should be the one who knows this stuff. My father and stepmum have a very bad relationship and will always badmouth about each other behind their backs to ME. And I always have to lie to both that they did not say anything about each other. I am constantly fat-shamed by my father since i overate due to depression and also expected to do well in my studies.

Right now I hate every single member of my family, my grandfather who is afraid of my father and will not hesitate to throw me under the bus to save himself. My younger sister who is very spoiled by my father and mother. My younger brother who I have opened up to about my feelings but only got ignored and laughed at. My stepmum who now keeps pestering me to stand up to my father since i'm 'more useful to him so he will listen', which of course will always end badly because my father will always manage to talk me down. And most of all, my father who is the source of all my problems. If only he did not exist, maybe i could have been happier somewhere else.

2 months ago, I tried killing myself ather having done no studying for my preliminary exams. However I chickened out and decided to help myself out of this situation. I made a plan to get a job and move out as soon as I could and then maybe I would be happy. I would have been very poor but as long as my father isn't around, i was sure i could manage. I was talked to by multiple teachers asking why my results were so bad/not the usual standard. But when i could have reached out about the abuse, i got worried that i was going to blow everything out of proportion and told them our family was in a difficult financial situation which is true but not the whole story. Because of this i did not receive the help I should have gotten and I have sinc then given up on continuing to live.

I realised how futile it was to continue living. Even if I was to get a job, forced conscription for 2 years when I'm 18 means I will lose it anyway. For at least another 5 years I have to share the same roof with him and I definitely could not keep sane for that long. Even if I managed to get a decent job, then what? I would be spending a good portion of my life trying to pay off his debt and that's just thinking long term. My finals will definitely make him beat me up which will not be the first time it happened. What I am most afraid of is the destruction of my phone which is the only reason that keeps me going. I love the internet and the many games I play and always look forward to the newest updates. It is the only reason i tried to escape my situation previously and how I convinced myself to not end my life. So with all the hardships I have to face in the future, I came to the conclusion that killing myself before my results are in is the best.

I apologise for writing so much, this is like a summary of my very short life. If I were to look at things positively, maybe my death would bring about a good change in my father. If it made his wrath worse, maybe my stepmum would garner the courage to call the cops on him again and i doubt his sentence would be as lenient. And if no significant change occurs, I am satisfied with the thought that my father would be suffering a lot more from his own actions.

I have been abused by my father ever since i could remember and have had no one to share my problems with, especially since my mother left me when i was 4. I really really really really despise my father for everything he put me through and one of the many reasons i want to kill myself is precisely because I know he will suffer beacuse of it. My father is a gambling addict and I am tired of him venting his frustrations when he loses money upon me. We used to be decently rich but he gambled everything away to the point of bankruptcy and huge debts. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 12 which was right after he got out of jail for domestic abuse. My step-mother had attempted to take her own life in front of the family and it is honestly very traumatising. Not only that my father has been scolding his own dad (my grandfather) to the point that he admits he wants to die too. I think I am like this now because of the 8 months my father spent in jail. I tasted freedom for the 1st time in my life and my step mother opened my eyes to the abuse I was receiving. If i still thought the abuse was normal then maybe I could have been handling this better. Being born in an asian household, perhaps this is normal for many but I am seriously having trouble coping right now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am just too tired to continue living. As the eldest brother and most fluent english speaker, much responsibility and expectaions have been placed upon me and I am tired of helping. My father always needs me to do stuff for him (paying bills, filing tax) and on several occasions I am incapable of doing them, I would get scolded for being useless. How is that even reasonable, no school would teach about this stuff and him being 30+ years older than me means he should be the one who knows this stuff. My father and stepmum have a very bad relationship and will always badmouth about each other behind their backs to ME. And I always have to lie to both that they did not say anything about each other. I am constantly fat-shamed by my father since i overate due to depression and also expected to do well in my studies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now I hate every single member of my family, my grandfather who is afraid of my father and will not hesitate to throw me under the bus to save himself. My younger sister who is very spoiled by my father and mother. My younger brother who I have opened up to about my feelings but only got ignored and laughed at. My stepmum who now keeps pestering me to stand up to my father since i&amp;#39;m &amp;#39;more useful to him so he will listen&amp;#39;, which of course will always end badly because my father will always manage to talk me down. And most of all, my father who is the source of all my problems. If only he did not exist, maybe i could have been happier somewhere else.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 months ago, I tried killing myself ather having done no studying for my preliminary exams. However I chickened out and decided to help myself out of this situation. I made a plan to get a job and move out as soon as I could and then maybe I would be happy. I would have been very poor but as long as my father isn&amp;#39;t around, i was sure i could manage. I was talked to by multiple teachers asking why my results were so bad/not the usual standard. But when i could have reached out about the abuse, i got worried that i was going to blow everything out of proportion and told them our family was in a difficult financial situation which is true but not the whole story. Because of this i did not receive the help I should have gotten and I have sinc then given up on continuing to live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I realised how futile it was to continue living. Even if I was to get a job, forced conscription for 2 years when I&amp;#39;m 18 means I will lose it anyway. For at least another 5 years I have to share the same roof with him and I definitely could not keep sane for that long. Even if I managed to get a decent job, then what? I would be spending a good portion of my life trying to pay off his debt and that&amp;#39;s just thinking long term. My finals will definitely make him beat me up which will not be the first time it happened. What I am most afraid of is the destruction of my phone which is the only reason that keeps me going. I love the internet and the many games I play and always look forward to the newest updates. It is the only reason i tried to escape my situation previously and how I convinced myself to not end my life. So with all the hardships I have to face in the future, I came to the conclusion that killing myself before my results are in is the best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I apologise for writing so much, this is like a summary of my very short life. If I were to look at things positively, maybe my death would bring about a good change in my father. If it made his wrath worse, maybe my stepmum would garner the courage to call the cops on him again and i doubt his sentence would be as lenient. And if no significant change occurs, I am satisfied with the thought that my father would be suffering a lot more from his own actions. The son he has called useless this entire time will finally become useless and he will regret ever hurting me. For those who believe that family comes first and that they will be the ones suffering after a loved one&amp;#39;s suicide, I doubt i would care if i was dead. I am very aware what I am trying to do is very selfish, after all he did raise me for 16 years. However I just want to not help them anymore, not when i am taken for granted. I doubt many fo you read this far after seeing the length. Never would I have thought I would post my story online which could potentially put me in danger but honestly i do not care much anymore.

,SuicideWatch,"To start this off i should probably give context to my life.

I was born with multiple malformations on my legs, one of them being my right leg not being able to grow as fast as my left (from both the knee and the hip) so i was forced to have many operations throughout my life. The first one being when i was around 6 weeks old, continuing up until last year. In total i would say i had over 45 operations done, and last year i found out ALOT of them were unnecessary and overly detrimental. I was also the victim of malpractice which i am currently involved in a lawsuit against that said doctor. I pretended to be happy most of my life, firstly it was childish ignorance then as i grew it turned into an act of myself, as i couldn't bare to watch my parents suffering any more because of me. It worked for awhile but last year, as i got the news about my malpractice and all of the operations done being mostly useless, i broke. I pretty much gave up the act and begged my parents to let me see a therapist so i can get diagnosed. I was diagnosed with depression pretty much in my first session and have been taking medication since then. Since having so many operations my feet are mostly scar tissue, making me have incredible nerve pains which are incurable, i also have a high tolerance to regular pain killers making it harder and harder to keep going. After almost 12 years of only physical pain, emotional pain and sadness i am tired. Recently found out my dad hasn't been happy since i was born so that's something that adds to my sadness.

I also have extreme sadistic urges whenever i get really angry and depressive. Not necessarily at myself cause i know i will not kill myself, no matter how deranged i made a vow to myself and i made my code of honor to never break those. The only way i will ever kill myself is by accident or if i were to ever lay my hand upon a woman (hit her or worse). Love your family and never hit a woman. These are my life rules. But i feel more and more deranged as the days pass by, i feel like i will snap one day and strangle a random person on the street that looks at me funny, and worse of all i know that i will partly feel good about doing it. I have tried everything to reduce my seething anger ( meditation, drugs, alcohol, hobbies, therapy, talking about it ) but nothing except physical exhaustion helped ( that also made me be ok for a few hours max)  and being disabled denies me of many things related to physical activities so my question to you, reading this, is. What could i do so i won't be drawn to killing someone in the future.

I also had my first relationship which ended after a few months because i entered my annually autumn depression, and she said she couldn't deal with it with me, broke up over the phone, first person i ever loved outside family :D

T.L.D.R.: Sad, clinically depressed, extreme chronic pains, and really angry. Want to kill people and self. Help.",t2_6yhyadic,False,,0,False,Some advice would be appreciated. 19 M (kinda long),[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jyf5qk,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,1605981686.0,,[],{},,True,,1606010114.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;To start this off i should probably give context to my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was born with multiple malformations on my legs, one of them being my right leg not being able to grow as fast as my left (from both the knee and the hip) so i was forced to have many operations throughout my life. The first one being when i was around 6 weeks old, continuing up until last year. In total i would say i had over 45 operations done, and last year i found out ALOT of them were unnecessary and overly detrimental. I was also the victim of malpractice which i am currently involved in a lawsuit against that said doctor. I pretended to be happy most of my life, firstly it was childish ignorance then as i grew it turned into an act of myself, as i couldn&amp;#39;t bare to watch my parents suffering any more because of me. It worked for awhile but last year, as i got the news about my malpractice and all of the operations done being mostly useless, i broke. I pretty much gave up the act and begged my parents to let me see a therapist so i can get diagnosed. I was diagnosed with depression pretty much in my first session and have been taking medication since then. Since having so many operations my feet are mostly scar tissue, making me have incredible nerve pains which are incurable, i also have a high tolerance to regular pain killers making it harder and harder to keep going. After almost 12 years of only physical pain, emotional pain and sadness i am tired. Recently found out my dad hasn&amp;#39;t been happy since i was born so that&amp;#39;s something that adds to my sadness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have extreme sadistic urges whenever i get really angry and depressive. Not necessarily at myself cause i know i will not kill myself, no matter how deranged i made a vow to myself and i made my code of honor to never break those. The only way i will ever kill myself is by accident or if i were to ever lay my hand upon a woman (hit her or worse). Love your family and never hit a woman. These are my life rules. But i feel more and more deranged as the days pass by, i feel like i will snap one day and strangle a random person on the street that looks at me funny, and worse of all i know that i will partly feel good about doing it. I have tried everything to reduce my seething anger ( meditation, drugs, alcohol, hobbies, therapy, talking about it ) but nothing except physical exhaustion helped ( that also made me be ok for a few hours max)  and being disabled denies me of many things related to physical activities so my question to you, reading this, is. What could i do so i won&amp;#39;t be drawn to killing someone in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also had my first relationship which ended after a few months because i entered my annually autumn depression, and she said she couldn&amp;#39;t deal with it with me, broke up over the phone, first person i ever loved outside family :D&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry if i added things as i went, this was a pretty rough way to summarize my life but i did my best.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Parents got divorced when I was in kindergarten; afterwards, my mother had partial custody of me. Then, one day, she just stopped picking me up for visitation -- but she was an addict (police busted the meth lab her roommates ran in her backyard, and the judge sent her to rehab...but then she just ran away from it, etc) and so I try not to hold it against her.

My father was a great man, who'd lived an interesting life and worked hard to provide the good life for me -- but then he went bankrupt when I was seventeen, and it went downhill fast. His business partner cheated him out of almost everything he was entitled to, and so we went from ""working class"" millionaires to living on handouts. He wouldn't drop his standard of living, and wouldn't prioritize bills before cigarettes, so he'd end up spending $7 of his last $10 on cigarettes and putting $3 in gas in the car, just enough to where he could drive to work the next day. If I asked him to stop, he'd threaten to kick me out of the car and force me to walk home. If I begged him to stop, he'd threaten to kick me out of the house and said he ""had no son."" If I asked my grandmother to intervene, she'd shout at me for spending $1 on a sweet tea at a gas station, when I skipped eating the night before because I didn't think we had the money. If my father took the money I had set aside to pay for my prescriptions, I was supposed to not say anything.

One day, I broke. My father got angry at his broken laptop, and refused to drive to his mother's to use her computer to file his income taxes (the EIN credit is massive when finding $5 on the sidewalk means you're eating good that night, and it was the last night to file,) so I began shouting. I screamed ""I can't do this anymore,"" and I screamed ""Please help me keep loving you"" -- and he'd mock me, sniffing his cigarettes as he chainsmoked them in my face. When he threatened to commit suicide, I called my grandmother, and after I threw a picture frame on the floor, he began to punch me in the face. I never punched back, because I couldn't bring myself to be the man that beat the person I idolized as a child. 

I called the cops. He lied and said I hit first, and my grandmother lied and said they were just ""wrestling."" She screamed at me, saying I had ""bitten the hand that fed me"", and said I couldn't live with her (despite her having a spare bedroom and complete financial ability to help.) She relented when she saw me call the only men's shelter in my city, and was told that they had no vacancies for the foreseeable future. Otherwise, she was completely fine with me being homeless.

So I moved in with her, and within three days, I got a job. I worked it for 40 hours a week in the southern heat, and though I hated every minute of it, I never threatened to quit. When I got COVID from work and my employer sent me home for two weeks, she screamed at me and said I'd ""made a big mistake."" When I got a concussion at work and was told by my doctor to stay home for ten days, she screamed at me for being ""lazy and with no ambition"", and made me go to work (I hadn't been able to sleep the night before, which is common in concussions, and so by the time my shift was over I had been awake for 25 hours straight.) I broke down crying in her car afterwards, and she treated me like I was a child.

**I feel so alone.** I can risk death at work, but I'm still ""lazy"" to her; she knows fully what all my father did after bankruptcy, and yet she still thinks we should ""reunify"" for the sake of the family. I'm being kicked out for Christmas, as my father will be coming over to her house, and yet I'll be told to be grateful that I get to come back home the next day. I'll go to Thanksgiving with my uncle and cousins, and yet they'll undoubtedly think of me as lazy, because my grandmother and father told them as much. I wanted to keep relationships with my family after leaving my father's house (I was about to move across the country until my housing arrangement fell through at the last moment, and considered never talking to these people again,) but it feels as if I am utterly worthless to them. What's the point of a family if they treat you like you're nothing?

And so here I am. No mother, no father. No degree, no hope. I try to be charitable in the hopes that it'll make god like me (I spent $130 on a woman's groceries the other day, when her EBT card was declined,) but I feel like it's fruitless to hold out for a blessing like that.

I'm also just waiting for my friends to slowly cut me off (which kinda seems impossible because they care about me a lot) and for my boyfriend to get tired of my poor mental health and shitty personality and break up with me.

One of my best friends has cut me off already and blocked me on twitter for some reason. She never communicates properly anyway, but it's still sad.

Anyway, I just don't have the energy to fully kill myself now because one of my batchmates died suddenly and another one has cancer (but will hopefully survive).

,SuicideWatch,"Im sorry, every single day I’m woken up with the same feelings and they don’t seem to be dissipating or even slightly going away, I’ve hurt so many people in such a short time and the idea that I could even do it again is so destroying and debilitating that I just can’t face that. I’m sorry for it all, I wish I could wake up feeling better and believing that things could Infact be better but I just know it can’t. I’ve not been happy with my life for a long period of time, and anytime I do get happiness, Every time I bring someone good in to my life, someone that genuinely makes me happy and someone I would do anything to make happy, I find some way to hurt them a lot, my fucked up thoughts and worries ruin things and makes me in to a selfish obsessed arsehole who breaks people’s trust, treats them like shit and ultimately shows them that they’d be better off without me. I let the same problems that have been engrained in to me flood over and I push people to the point where they no longer see the value in me being in their life, and I truly don’t blame them. I don’t value me so it’s not surprising that the people I treat like shit don’t either. I am an awful person, I’ve treated the few people who I was so lucky to have close to me, all so disgustingly bad, saying and doing things that wouldn’t be expected of someone who is meant to care for someone. There isn’t an excuse, mental health isn’t an excuse to treat anyone badly or be a toxic horrible person. 





I destroy relationships, I do it through my own selfish means without even realising I’m doing it half the time, I subconsciously am an awful person, people welcome me in to their life and I fuck it up time and time again. Every single person who has been with me is now happier without me in their life, their life’s actually improved when I wasn’t in it. That’s so unbelievably telling of the person I am and the things I do. It doesn’t matter how many chances I’m offered, I always never learn and I continue to say disgustingly stupid things that I don’t mean, but I don’t think about the things I say I just say them without the social awareness to understand how they come across, I do it so much all the time and all it does is hurt people. This isn’t a self pity thing where I feel not good enough or feel like no one cares or understands me, it’s that people do care but I hurt them and treat them in such awful ways that they can’t have me in their life anymore, for their own sake. I’m not a good person, I’m a fucking awful person. So why spend time trying to improve myself when I don’t even believe that anything will work to change me, and then eventually end up hurting someone else? Nothing will change who I am. I’m an emotional manipulator, a controller and a horrible fucking person. I abuse people and it’s really that simple. 





I don’t know why I do the terrible things I do, but I don’t blame anyone for not wanting me in their life, I wouldn’t want me in it either. No amount of therapy, self help books, medication or “learning from your past” will change that because I just keep doing it and even though I try everything I can to change, it still happens. Why should I need a book, CBT, DBT you name what ever kind of therapy you want, just to function like a normal person? To treat people normally, to not act out in incredibly awful ways? Why can’t I just be normal?  Most people go through their life having friends, relationships, family members that they never treat like shit, who never act in such awful ways who don’t need therapy, medication, self help to get better or to just be better. I’m not normal, I’m this way because that’s the person I am, and the only person who can actually change me Is me, but I’ve tried time and time again, Im done trying to pretend I’ll ever be anything other than an awful, horrible, deceptive, manipulative piece of shit. My life has literally been littered with shame and guilt and no matter how bad I want to change or how much I try the same things keep happening, I keep pushing away and hurting the people I care so much about. It always gets to the point where I’ve hurt the person I love too much and they need to leave my life for their own good or my issues are so deep ridden that I’ll never be that person they want me to be, I just hurt people and have never been worth it to anyone, and I can’t blame them. 





I never felt good enough growing up, not from anyone, my family, my parents I always felt like I was letting down or annoying, always falling out with and arguing with and I’m sorry that I was never the child you wanted me to be, it shows I was born that way, it’s me I’m the problem, my brother ive never been close with or talked to really, didn’t have many friends at school and the few I did either cut me out their life when they met better ones and the one person that stayed I pushed away by treating him awfully, and the couple of friends I have now, I fear doing the same to. I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again and the truth is everyone is better with me not in their life they just haven’t realised it yet. No relationships should have the amount of problems I bring to them, 4 years, 1 and a half years or two months it doesn’t matter, I bring an abundance of toxicity and pain to them and I don’t think that will ever change, I’m sorry to those who have experienced that first hand and the shit I did to you, the tears I brought you, the relentless problems. You wanted me in your life but eventually realised I’m not the person you thought I was. It’s just who I am, internally. I’m thankful for the experiences and happiness that these people have brought me but truly sorry and ashamed for the damage I’ve done. For not repaying your love and support. I bring no positive qualities to people’s life’s and never will, I bring no positive qualities to my own life and never will. Its soul destroying. 





I wish I wasn’t me and I can’t continue to live, being me. I’m honestly sorry to anyone this hurts by the decision to do this, I wanted to be normal, I wish I could be so fucking badly but I’m just not, i never will be. I’m honestly a weirdo, an unsociable freak. I make decisions, awful decisions, awful reactions to situations that no one in their right mind would make, I’ve always done it and I always will because I’m fucked in the head. Everyday to me feels the exact same and has for nearly 2 months now, I’m trapped literally reliving all the awful things I did to people and the fact my life consists of the same shit everyday right now is a product of that. A product of me. Even though I don’t want to hurt people, yet I do time and time again, all of my life has consisted of losing people who mean a lot to me and realise they are better off. I’ve never had many friends or people I felt connected to, always felt in a way isolated and it’s not that crazy that when I meet someone I love that I expect too much from them, I become clingy and pushy, I am extremely selfish, I’m a horrible person by nature. 





So many people have left my life and been better off, while every time I’m left facing me and the reality of it all, I don’t have anything worth it. Nothing I do gives me purpose, and anything that does make me happy I ruin. I feel so empty so pointless, literally nothing makes me happy or matters to me, and it’s so bad because it should, I should care and be happy but I’m not, I have a car, one year off a degree, stable job and money but that’s never mattered to me, I’ve never taken the opportunities to make a friend group, I wake up everyday to no texts or messages from anyone because I’m not a fun person to have in someone’s life, other people are. I get told over and over that I need to learn to be alone, but I’ve been alone my entire life I don’t do things that people my age should be doing or things I want to do because having people to do them with is what makes them special and matter. I’m sick of being alone. literally my entire life has been me being my only real friend, and anyone who does come in to my life I push away or isolate myself from them because I know I’ll eventually hurt them. Any social interaction I’m invited to or I’m part of I act like a controlling manipulative weirdo and want to make it all about me, no one wants me in their life and it’s not that hard to see why, I’m not someone is fun to be around or have in life. 





Im an embarrassment to people and I’m an embarrassment to myself, I wake up every day alone to do the same stuff over and over again, just trying to get to the next day, why would anyone want that? Everyday I want to die because this is not the person I ever wanted to be, or how I ever wanted to treat people, but it’s the reality of it. I’ve always had the idea to move country and get away, start my life again, but I’ve done that in certain aspects and I’ve fucked it up time and time again, the same stuff keeps happening, because the issue isn’t other people, it’s me. When people come in to my life they wonder why I do the certain things I do why my social media is so sparse, why I’m not out with people as much why I don’t have many friends, why I spend so much time on places like Reddit and I’m focused so much on self help, it’s because Its an escape to the reality of my life, about not wanting to be me and realising that there really aren’t many people in my life that see me as important to them or would consider me a good friend. It’s always been like that, I’ve always felt different from the rest and always been alone, it’s probably a big reason why I cling so much on to relationships because without that, I have virtually no social interaction and losing that person is literally losing everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m alone in life because I’m not good to have in others life’s, that’s been made clear to me time and time again. When I hurt someone like I have to people I’ve been lucky enough to love, I just choose to remove myself from their life at this point because it’s clear they’d be so much better off, forgetting ever meeting me, I’m a negative thing in their life and I can’t blame them for thinking that, it’s been that way my entire life, being someone that hinders people’s life’s, not benefits them. It’s why I have nothing. Im a hurdle to a happier life for them. I always was left feeling wonder why I never experienced anything with family when people spend so much time with their parents and get along with them, doing so much with friends being able to socialise and just be wanted by others, I’ve never had that and don’t think I ever will, I’m not deserving of it ive had chances to get that life I always wanted but being 25 and seeing where I am and how the same patterns continue and continue, it’s not worth the amount of serious therapy, medication everything to potentially be better, it won’t ever happen, I’m scared of being 30 35 40 or older and still having the same problems over and over, that’s not a life I Want to live, it’s never been. Should anyone go through life trying their hardest to not be the person they are? Is that a way to live? Waking up everyday trying to not be you? That’s been me my entire life, imagining, dreaming and sometimes praying to be someone different to be a person who has a life worth living, something about myself to make me care for the life I live with people who make me happy and who I can experience so much with. I’m tired of all of this pain and loneliness, it’s constantly realising I’m never gonna live that life I wanted and be with the people I do, because I’ll just hurt and hurt over and over again. I’m not happy being me and can’t imagine I ever will be, I live each day thinking about my past and the happiness I had and how I find ways each time to destroy it and that’s an issue with me as a person. I wish that things were different and my life wasn’t a continued feeling of regret and hate for myself but it’s not. I hate everything I’ve done, the way I let myself be and I just can’t keep waking up with the overbearing shame of it all. No matter how hard I try, the amount of effort, emotionally and mentally to be a better person, the person I want to be, it never changes. I repeat the same selfish, manipulative patters every time, I leave those who I care so much about freaked out and scared by my actions and who could blame them? I literally push the people I love to be scared of me, their families not wanting them to be involved with me anymore their friends thinking they’d be be better off without me, and where does that leave me? Facing the reality of my actions of the person I am of the person I let myself be time and time again, I’m a monster a fucking freak and someone no one should have the misfortune of having in their life. They deserve better, so much better, and I absolutely do not. I put myself in these situations I create them, I give myself the false hope that I can be happy, have someone in my life that does make me happy, someone I truly fucking care so much about but I always, always find some way to fuck it up, to ruin the thing that I love so much, and then I’m left thinking about this stuff day to day realising how much of an awful person I am, I never learned the first time it happened, the second or third so who’s to say I will now? I appreciate everyone who has tried to help me and support me through this hard time, you tried you’re absolute best but I’m too far gone, this was inevitable it always has been. 





The inclination of hope was the only thing I’ve had to keep going in the last years. That things could improve I could get that life I wanted, that I could have the people in it that matter the most. It’s been rightfully shot down time and time again even when I try to fix things, commit to being better I delude myself to think I’ll ever change. The reality is when I hear the tone of their voice when talking to me. The coldness of it, the lack of interest in me or having anything to do with me, and not just them everyone around them family and friends alike. They don’t want anything to do with someone like me, I had people that used to be excited to see me spend time with me and truly brought me so much happiness and I’ve pushed away like always because I can’t ever be the person they hoped I’d be, the person I hoped I’d be. They see me for what I truly am, a horrible, selfish and destructive person. They have every right to no longer want someone like me in their life and feel they would be better off if I wasn’t part of it. I deserve this all of this. It’s why I’m alone, why Im the person I am, the choices I make are my own and I live with those choices every single day. Everyone would be better off without me in their life that’s the only thing I’m sure about. I hate no one but myself so please don’t think or believe that any of this was directed outwards, I cared and still care so much about those that I hurt but my actions have always been telling of the person I am and the life I live. This isn’t a case of just pushing through this hard time because I’ve tried to distract myself, meeting people, watching tv, playing games, going out walks talking to my family and grandparents and everything you are supposed to do in hard times, but my life has been this constant feeling of being unwanted and lack of identity, I don’t know who I am or what matters to me, the only times I’ve ever felt truly myself and happy is when I am with those that I love and to have people that mean so much to me, and holding out hope that a person like that will once again appear in my life isn’t worth all this constant hate for myself. I mentally and physically just can’t do this anymore, hurting people I care about and put so much in to loving, and then have them leave my life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I never have and anytime I think things have gotten better I find a way to fall back to where I was but this time it’s so much worse, I genuinely believe there’s something defective with me as a person, I think I’m internally broken, I’m a crazy person who obsesses over being someone else. I hate the skin I am in. 




It hurts so much to care so much about someone, to try your hardest to be the best person you can be, and yet continue to fuck it all up, because you can’t change. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me, and going on living each day wishing I wasn’t me isn’t something I want to do anymore. I miss the feeling of having someone I care so much about in my life, that feeling of connection and love, it takes so much for me to feel that feeling of love and belief that someone loves me but every time, every fucking time I ruin it, I change their perception of me, I show them why I’m not someone they want in their life. Now I wake up everyday with constant thoughts each day are of the people I’ve hurt and lost due to my actions and just how fucking weird and horrible I am, I don’t want to keep doing that, I can’t justify it in anyway, I’m pathetic. I don’t see how anyone could ever love someone so fucked up. No one deserves to be treated the way I treated people. I sincerely hope they live a happy life, they absolutely deserve it, because even though it all ended through me being so horrible to them, they brought me happiness that meant the world to me, genuinely. 



This isn’t anyone’s fault but mine so please don’t feel guilty for it, no one can save me from myself or the things I do over and over again, so please don’t look for someone or something to blame, this was my decision, something I caused and created and this is the only thing I’ve felt sure about. I’m really sorry I wish I was a better, different person, but I’ll never be the person I want to be or how I want to be for others. These have been the loneliest, lowest, most self hating months of my entire life, I can’t keep running from the person I am and the things I do. I just can’t bare to see someone I care so much about leave my life again and decide they are better off because of the things I do, my life isn’t what I ever wanted it to be, and the way I treat people isn’t the way I ever wanted to treat them, but I always cross the line and lose the person who means more than anything to me. I’m a disgusting person and that’s all I ever have been, I assure you the world will be a better place without horribly toxic people like me in it. There is no going back now.

I put myself in these situations I create them, I give myself the false hope that I can be happy, have someone in my life that does make me happy, someone I truly fucking care so much about but I always, always find some way to fuck it up, to ruin the thing that I love so much, and then I’m left thinking about this stuff day to day realising how much of an awful person I am, I never learned the first time it happened, the second or third so who’s to say I will now? I appreciate everyone who has tried to help me and support me through this hard time, you tried you’re absolute best but I’m too far gone, this was inevitable it always has been. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The inclination of hope was the only thing I’ve had to keep going in the last years. That things could improve I could get that life I wanted, that I could have the people in it that matter the most. It’s been rightfully shot down time and time again even when I try to fix things, commit to being better I delude myself to think I’ll ever change. The reality is when I hear the tone of their voice when talking to me. The coldness of it, the lack of interest in me or having anything to do with me, and not just them everyone around them family and friends alike. They don’t want anything to do with someone like me, I had people that used to be excited to see me spend time with me and truly brought me so much happiness and I’ve pushed away like always because I can’t ever be the person they hoped I’d be, the person I hoped I’d be. They see me for what I truly am, a horrible, selfish and destructive person. They have every right to no longer want someone like me in their life and feel they would be better off if I wasn’t part of it. I deserve this all of this. It’s why I’m alone, why Im the person I am, the choices I make are my own and I live with those choices every single day. Everyone would be better off without me in their life that’s the only thing I’m sure about. I hate no one but myself so please don’t think or believe that any of this was directed outwards, I cared and still care so much about those that I hurt but my actions have always been telling of the person I am and the life I live. This isn’t a case of just pushing through this hard time because I’ve tried to distract myself, meeting people, watching tv, playing games, going out walks talking to my family and grandparents and everything you are supposed to do in hard times, but my life has been this constant feeling of being unwanted and lack of identity, I don’t know who I am or what matters to me, the only times I’ve ever felt truly myself and happy is when I am with those that I love and to have people that mean so much to me, and holding out hope that a person like that will once again appear in my life isn’t worth all this constant hate for myself. I mentally and physically just can’t do this anymore, hurting people I care about and put so much in to loving, and then have them leave my life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I never have and anytime I think things have gotten better I find a way to fall back to where I was but this time it’s so much worse, I genuinely believe there’s something defective with me as a person, I think I’m internally broken, I’m a crazy person who obsesses over being someone else. I hate the skin I am in. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It hurts so much to care so much about someone, to try your hardest to be the best person you can be, and yet continue to fuck it all up, because you can’t change. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me, and going on living each day wishing I wasn’t me isn’t something I want to do anymore. I miss the feeling of having someone I care so much about in my life, that feeling of connection and love, it takes so much for me to feel that feeling of love and belief that someone loves me but every time, every fucking time I ruin it, I change their perception of me, I show them why I’m not someone they want in their life. Now I wake up everyday with constant thoughts each day are of the people I’ve hurt and lost due to my actions and just how fucking weird and horrible I am, I don’t want to keep doing that, I can’t justify it in anyway, I’m pathetic. I don’t see how anyone could ever love someone so fucked up. No one deserves to be treated the way I treated people. I sincerely hope they live a happy life, they absolutely deserve it, because even though it all ended through me being so horrible to them, they brought me happiness that meant the world to me, genuinely. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This isn’t anyone’s fault but mine so please don’t feel guilty for it, no one can save me from myself or the things I do over and over again, so please don’t look for someone or something to blame, this was my decision, something I caused and created and this is the only thing I’ve felt sure about. I’m really sorry I wish I was a better, different person, but I’ll never be the person I want to be or how I want to be for others. These have been the loneliest, lowest, most self hating months of my entire life, I can’t keep running from the person I am and the things I do. I just can’t bare to see someone I care so much about leave my life again and decide they are better off because of the things I do, my life isn’t what I ever wanted it to be, and the way I treat people isn’t the way I ever wanted to treat them, but I always cross the line and lose the person who means more than anything to me. I’m a disgusting person and that’s all I ever have been, I assure you the world will be a better place without horribly toxic people like me in it. There is no going back now. I’m so sorry.&lt;/p&gt;

I have my plan all put together, I got the final missing parts to it today. I'm not going to kill myself right now this minute. The watch has started though, the clock is just ticking and ticking away.

Everything I've seen and read points to me ending up in the hospital in the eventual case of when I get COVID. I'm a big dude, not as big as I use to be, but I've always been able to keep up. I've made some lifestyle change for the better in quarantine, but not enough to change the fact of where I'll end up. I also found out I'm going to have to go to the worst hospital system in my state, that's neat. 

If it doesn't kill me in the hospital, then I'm definitely going to be left with permanent lifelong disabilities. The simple fact of the matter is that the life I had before won't be possible post-COVID. There won't be concerts or karaoke nights. There won't be barcrawls or musume trips. Nothing. My friends will move on and simply just replace me. I'm already in my 30s so it's not like I'm going to be making any new friends. What would we even do? 'Hey let's just sit around because I can't breathe anymore, I would say let's talk but again, the breathing thing.'

I could go on and on with the after effects and and thing I won't be able to do. There's strokes, heart attacks, seizures, permanent memory loss, permanent sexual dysfunction, the list goes on and on and on and on and it DOESN'T GET ANY FUCKING BETTER. The worst of it all that so much of it is out of my control. I can't do a fucking thing about it.  

I use to hate myself but I got to a good place. I was fucking happy for once in my life. I had a group of friends, I had events I ran in my local city, I was seeing someone but that ended because of COVID, I had an job and a great side gig. Left with the job now, but hey it did let me buy the things I needed for this. Now I'm here looking down the perveriable barrel of a gun I can't control. 

I'm not going to sit and let myself be crippled by it. I don't want to see myself become a shell of myself.

,SuicideWatch,"TL;DR: I attempted suicide earlier this month. I am having trouble recovering. How long will it take to move on from an event like this, and how should one cope?

Almost three weeks ago, I overdosed on Tylenol PM. I had thoroughly researched the effects of acetaminophen, and I knew exactly how much to take. I had already put my affairs in order, cleaned up my bedroom, and written a note. All that was left was to do the deed.

I sat on my bed, shook out the correct number of pills, and cracked open a bottle of water.

I thought I knew what I was doing, but I didn't. I didn't realize how strong the ""PM"" portion of the medicine would be. I assumed that I would get slightly drowsy and then fall into a peaceful slumber.

But that's not how it happened.

Instead of being lulled to sleep, it felt like something was trying to drag me to sleep. It was violent. I became frightened. Less than two hours later, I was in the back of an ambulance on its way to the nearest hospital.

I spent five days in the hospital. Two days in ED and three days in behavioral. I doubt that any of the paramedics or nurses who cared for me will ever see this, but I am forever grateful to them.

Because my attempted method of suicide was an overdose, I was housed with the recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. Initially, I was scared. I had depression. Why were they putting me with people who had substance abuse issues? We were supposed to offer each other support and guidance. What could I possibly learn from druggies and drunks?

It turns out that I could learn a lot. Most of the people there had underlying issued with depression or other mental illnesses, and that is what led them to become dependent on drugs or alcohol. They were some of the wisest and bravest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I couldn’t believe how ignorant and biased I had been.

Now, here I am, three weeks later.

Fortunately, I have fully recovered from my attempt. At least, physically. Of course, my depression is far from being ""cured."" I have been prescribed Zoloft, and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon. However, I am still lethargic, unmotivated, and bogged down by a whole host of other symptoms. 

The biggest obstacle I have run into is recovering from this whole affair. For a while, I had trouble sleeping in my bed. I kept thinking about that night. Everytime I laid down, I swore I could smell rotting flesh. When I woke up in the morning, I was surprised that I was still alive. 

I am avoiding school. My professors have sent me concerned messages, and I know that my grades are dropping, but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I have to go to work tomorrow (I took the last two weeks off) but I don't know if I can even manage that. I have been spending my days lounging around the house, sleeping, staring at the T.V., and feebly attempting to get back into my old hobbies.

At first, I was so angry and disgusted with myself. Why am I acting like this? Why can't I move on? Why can't I return to my everyday life? I started to regret going to the hospital. I scorned myself for being too weak to follow through with my plans. I began to wish that I actually had died.

But now I realize that it takes time to recover from something like this. No one should expect someone who survived a suicide attempt to immediately be able to return to their daily lives. It takes time to cope with all of the emotions. I am trying to be patient with myself, and yet...

,SuicideWatch,"I feel so useless and unheard. No one truly cares how I feel, no one understands what I have to go through.

I'm 26 years, living with my family (parents and sister). I'm from (low)middle class family.
When I was young, I was bullied about being poor, about my shape, and everything. I always felt like a loser. I told my mom and she told me not to worry about it...no one listened to me.

In 2012, my mom got crashed by a car, the police didnt give a fuck about it. My mom's leg was broken back then and we didnt have enough money to go to the hospital. Meanwhile I passed the test for a Medical School but I couldn't go there because we needed money for my mom first. My dream had gone. (It's impossible to try again in my country if you're over 26 years+poor)

After seeing the thing that happened to my mom. I started studying Laws myself. I read too much. I thought I was going to change the system. I thought we all deserve justice no matter who we are. Finally I got to study in Faculty of Law.
But things didnt go so well, I still got bullied by words and actions by classmates and Profs. because I'm poor, I dont have a car, my mom still took me to the Uni by old truck and old motorcycle (3people riding1 motorcycle, my mom, me,my sis). My Uni life was terrible I can say, I still dreamt about it sometimes and woke up crying. Luckily I have few good friends to help me get through it.
In the last year of my Law school, I won a scholarship to study Masters degree  in Europe but had to pay for some stuffs. I told my prof. that I didnt have that much money but I'll try to get it. She told me if I dont have money, she'd give that scholarship to her niece(who's my classmate) and finally she did. I lost it again.

After finished university, I started working as a legal officer. It was a great job with great salary. But its soooo far from home. 
I was happy working there until my boss tried to rape me. I told my coworker, the thing she replied to me was ""It happens here"". I was shocked, I told my parents, they told me to call the police, so I did. And again, the police didnt give a fuck, they said my boss is too big to deal with. And then everyone in that area knew about my story, everyone looked at me like a murder. I talked to my lawyer friends, they couldnt help because I didnt have enough money and power. My parents told me to quit but I didnt. 
One day my boss and the gang came to my room with a gun, he said ""If you dont get out of here, I'll kill you"". I didnt tell anyone about it, I quit and came back home. (He got me 100k debt before I quit)
I got a new job in my hometown. My coworker flirted with me. But I didnt like him...and I didnt know that a woman who works in the office had a crush on him. [CRAZY]
Everything's getting worse. My coworkers(women) started bullying me, spy, hacked my facebook, used my ID number doing bad things, came to my house and threw something in my windows, told my boss that I stole something. My boss talked to me, no one believed me.
Meanwhile...I was with my boyfriend, I told him I wanted to quit this job, I cant handle it anymore, I cried so often. And he helped me. I quit that job. He sends me some money. 

The thing is I'm not happy to be like this. I want to work. I'm still in debt. I applied for like 40 jobs but no one called me. I passed the test to be government officer but they didnt call me (it takes soooo long).
Now I'm tired. I'm jobless. I'm broke. I'm useless. While seeing all my friends getting married, having good jobs, having family, getting new houses. But I'm here, sometimes I dont even have food to eat, no power, no water. I applied for a part time jobs but they said they dont want people who studied Law. (Yeah, they gonna cheat). Sometimes I worked as a part time waitress and they didnt pay or only paid Half. And I could do nothing because no one listened to me.
Yesterday my dad told us that the owner wont let him rent the shop anymore before we dont have money to pay since Covid19 hit. (He couldnt make money for long time tho, I'm the one who pays everything in this house)
Now I feel so stressed and hopeless. Some night I feel like dying, suicide comes across my mind so often. But if I die, no one will take care of my family. 
I'm just tired.

In the last year of my Law school, I won a scholarship to study Masters degree  in Europe but had to pay for some stuffs. I told my prof. that I didnt have that much money but I&amp;#39;ll try to get it. She told me if I dont have money, she&amp;#39;d give that scholarship to her niece(who&amp;#39;s my classmate) and finally she did. I lost it again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finished university, I started working as a legal officer. It was a great job with great salary. But its soooo far from home. 
I was happy working there until my boss tried to rape me. I told my coworker, the thing she replied to me was &amp;quot;It happens here&amp;quot;. I was shocked, I told my parents, they told me to call the police, so I did. And again, the police didnt give a fuck, they said my boss is too big to deal with. And then everyone in that area knew about my story, everyone looked at me like a murder. I talked to my lawyer friends, they couldnt help because I didnt have enough money and power. My parents told me to quit but I didnt. 
One day my boss and the gang came to my room with a gun, he said &amp;quot;If you dont get out of here, I&amp;#39;ll kill you&amp;quot;. I didnt tell anyone about it, I quit and came back home. (He got me 100k debt before I quit)
I got a new job in my hometown. My coworker flirted with me. But I didnt like him...and I didnt know that a woman who works in the office had a crush on him. [CRAZY]
Everything&amp;#39;s getting worse. My coworkers(women) started bullying me, spy, hacked my facebook, used my ID number doing bad things, came to my house and threw something in my windows, told my boss that I stole something. My boss talked to me, no one believed me.
Meanwhile...I was with my boyfriend, I told him I wanted to quit this job, I cant handle it anymore, I cried so often. And he helped me. I quit that job. He sends me some money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The thing is I&amp;#39;m not happy to be like this. I want to work. I&amp;#39;m still in debt. I applied for like 40 jobs but no one called me. I passed the test to be government officer but they didnt call me (it takes soooo long).
Now I&amp;#39;m tired. I&amp;#39;m jobless. I&amp;#39;m broke. I&amp;#39;m useless. While seeing all my friends getting married, having good jobs, having family, getting new houses. But I&amp;#39;m here, sometimes I dont even have food to eat, no power, no water. I applied for a part time jobs but they said they dont want people who studied Law. (Yeah, they gonna cheat). Sometimes I worked as a part time waitress and they didnt pay or only paid Half. And I could do nothing because no one listened to me.
Yesterday my dad told us that the owner wont let him rent the shop anymore before we dont have money to pay since Covid19 hit. (He couldnt make money for long time tho, I&amp;#39;m the one who pays everything in this house)
Now I feel so stressed and hopeless. Some night I feel like dying, suicide comes across my mind so often. But if I die, no one will take care of my family. 
I&amp;#39;m just tired.&lt;br/&gt;
Thank you for reading. &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

Im Sorry.

I don’t know what to do with this fake happiness.

And I can’t live with it getting worse.

I can’t participate anymore.

In the drudgery and doom

The world is ending for me.

I hate that it has to go on in you with pain.

I don’t want to do this to you.

But I need to start thinking of me.

Iâ€™m reaching, but I fall.

Dark

And no morning

Nothingness is the gift.

And for me, the right exit.

Because of that, I missed a lot of classes and I didn't deliver any homework I had to. My mom always tried her best to see only the best in me and now, seeing her just looking at me sadly... I just fucked up horribly.

I also rejected an offer to go to college, because I was scared it would lead me nowhere and It would be a big waste of time. They wouldn't even put me in anyways, so it doesn't matter anyways.

And I subscribe to that worldview because I only look at good-looking people too, so I am a hypocrite to complain. I just wish I wasn’t me. I see people with monumentally better lives and I wonder how they got so lucky to be them. I’m stuck like this forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s just not fair. Nothing is fair. I see no other option than to take myself out of the equation. There is no other solution to this endless suffering.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This is long and I cannot go on with life after being backstabbed and banned from one of my biggest hobbies and the camp I wanted to raise my kids at in the future. I violated a rule of internet contact by talking with scouts over the pandemic to get me through it and one of them reported me after having a mental breakdown when I was blocked after sending way too many messages to apologize and I looked crazy , I kept reaching out to try and do damage control but it just made my situation worse trying to salvage the friendship and staff bond. I am eventually going to kill myslef at the camp now in the new dining hall I will never get to see.

The pandemic is making my situation worse and there is no light at the end of the tunnel even when it ends knowing I can't go back to the place that gave me a purpose. I had sent nothing inappropriate or threatening we just got into a minor argument over a misunderstanding that I took out of context. Now everyone from the camp will think I said something predatory or threatening when not knowing the details and I can't live with my reputation ruined like that when all the scouts looked up to me and staff members respected me. 




I am 27 and was proud of who I was 1-2 months before all this happened.  I destroyed so little in such a short amount of time with the Girl Eagle scout I was going to work with and mentored and I now look like a monster. I shouldn't have been in contact with a 16 year old girl in the first place this was the root of my problem but I saw her as a friend I made at camp and was bringing her up as a staff member as if she was a daughter of my own. I have no kids and teaching the scouts at camp filled the void of not having any of my own. She was willing to sell me her art and was a pretty and kind person to be around. Keeping in touch with everyone from the camp was keeping me going through the covid pandemic . I just wanted one year with us all working together before camp was canceled in 2020.  I ruined it all by bothering her and getting mad over a dumb comment and made it worse by apologizing and reaching out too much until I got reported for internet harassment now I feel like an evil monster when all I wanted to do was save the bond I had with her as a staff member, friend and mentor. 

The camp had saved my life from alcoholism in 2019 and got me into shape from 270lbs to 220 lbs from quitting alcohol and staying active. My own childhood camp from when I was a scout.  I was proud to be part of a huge year in which girls had joined the bsa and was happy to have a future first generation girl eagle scout in my center to be part of history with me and give me a purpose in life. 

Me and the girl Eagle scout were talking online one night and I took a comment she made out of context and got unnecessarily mad that she had said ""ew"" to a dumb story I had told. In a normal mind state I would brush this off. She had apologized and then I became a kiss ass apologizing back and sent 8 messages over the course of 4 hours in one night until I got blocked on IG.

I had panicked and kept messaging her on different platforms that I was suicidal and to please unblock me so we can remain friends. I was hormonally unstable from steroids my personal trainer put me on and was panicking in an anxiety attack. I kept going through the day on different platforms begging for her forgiveness and probably scared her so bad looking back in hindsight and looked like a creepy stalker. I wish I can go back in time and stop this but I can't and feel like death is the next option because it will be all I can think about forever and I will be living in constant pain. 

The worst part about this was she looked up to me a lot and liked me as a person before this emotional meltdown happened. I lost her as a friend forever and ended up getting reported to the camp by her because I couldn't stop bothering her through email after she had called for help when I was suicidal. It took weeks for my hormones to be somewhat normal and out of my system. 

During this time frame I had also lost hours of my job severely due to covid cutbacks lost my dog for 5 days. I found out my sister had been raped too and I can't go back in time to stop myself from messaging the girl when I had such a short fuse and wish I never even responded negatively to her original comment when she said ""ew"" to my story. The steroids made me unable to rationalize this.

Now my brain can think straight again but this is the bad part. All of the emotion of being banned is hitting me and all the memories of camp I had and all the friends I made haunting me in my dreams and nightmars. My reputation is ruined people will think I am a creep or predator when all I wanted to do was salvage the relationship with the girl eagle scout I mentored so she would stay in my center and make me art because she was extremely talented. She will become a popular staff member and knowing I will never be there to witness her success and the fact she hates me and is scared to ever contact me again kills me inside. All of this was preventable within one week. 

I can't go back to the camp or visit when staff is there because what I did makes me a risk. It is a problem enough that the boy scouts organization is being sued for sexual harassment.  I wanted to put my sons and daughters in scouts and have a dynasty at the camp in the future.  Now all of my dreams are stomped out and my reason to live I wanted to be a Ranger there . My purpose in life is gone teaching those kids and knowing how popular I was with them on staff is killing me. I can't even join the military after being potentially suicidal now. I have no way to redeem myself in life. 

I already have bothered some staff about suicide after this happened and they called for help but it doesn't work. They just sit me in a room and have police talk to me and sitting in the room with other mental patients just makes me want to die faster or get out fast so I lie and tell them im not suicidal just so I can get out. Ive been there twice in one week. I am never going back there I will be dead before I ever reach the mental health emergency at the hospital again. 

To make it worse the hospital said to reconcile with whoever sent help yet I was blocked on everything and emailed her a fake report I typed up because I was desperate to save the situation and wanted her to know I was safe at the time. 

I am sorry Victoria and sorry to the Boy scouts organization for making this look so bad and making this more pressure on the Narragansett council and camp Yawgoog.  I can never see her reach eagle or tell her how proud I am because I am blocked from all contact on every platform yet we would talk for months during the pandemic. She hates me now forever and is scared to ever talk to me again because of the meltdown and messages sent. Its about to get worse tho once they find ny dead body and notes and it makes the news. 

I became way too emotionally attached after she decided to paint me a staff hat that I will never get now.  She will also never want to see me again and probably wishes I was dead and I deserve it. I should be dead right now  but the only thing keeping me alive is my parents love and family. 

I want to just kill myself at the camp it was my life and my new identity and it will make the proper gravesite for me. Its where I would feel necessary to do it. I can't ever see the new dining hall they built either with staff and scouts in it. I should just end it because all I can think about is the girl Victoria and the camp and all my friends on staff I will never see again. My dream job as a Ranger there is ruined forever and everyone that finds out that I am banned for obsessively harassing a 16 year girl electronically to try and fix a friendship and staff bond everyone will see it the wrong way. I will just look like a stalker or pedophile or groomer or serial killer. When it wasn't the case at all she was my apprentice and pride to mentor. 


I know for a fact her parents , troop, or council will never reverse the decision to let me teach there ever again. I don't want my friends from camp to know when I plan on committing suicide there at the camp. My life is wrecked completely and reputation is ruined. All the scouts made songs about me and its all ruined from that one week of steroid abuse and being mentally unstable from hearing about my sister being sexually assaulted made me want to kill someone. I wish I never messaged the girl in that mind state. 

I lost my only purpose in life that gave me happiness in life and the summer.  I know therapy will never help this situation.  All I can picture in my head is all of the staff taking their staff pictures and having fun and I will never be there with them again. I also don't even know if I can join another BSA camp or not depending on the level of what was said by the parents and obviously they are overprotective of their daughter who is 16 and contacted a 27 year old. Nobody will know it was in a wholesome way and never meant anything sexual or negative in our chats. I just tried so hard to salvage our friendship and looked like a crazy stalker because the steroids destroyed my mental state.

This would never have even happened if we worked together in 2020 and the pandemic never happened. I felt the need to stay in touch with everyone after our season was canceled so badly. It is why I talked to everyone from camp in the first place even the young scouts and old staff members.  I had nothing else to stay happy about except thinking about the pandemics end and being back together at camp. I wouldn't have even tried bodybuilding steroids either if my trainer didn't recommend them. But I have nothing else to do with low job hours then to physically push myself . 

I just hope they know there will be a time when my body will be found dead in the camp dining hall. Everyone will know how badly I was treated mentally and neglected when I vented emotionally to her and warned that I would become suicidal if I was banned. Im glad to know my emotions meant nothing to her and the camp. I am just disposable despite being one of the best people in my center. I did not have to get reported by her if she just waited the 2 weeks for me to become mentally stable again and rationalized not to bother her. She did not have to block me after pouring out emotion to apologize in our original chat even if it was annoying.  It was not the right thing to do she could've just told me to stop but instead cut off all contact and reported me for trying to reach out and let her know how bad my mental state was . Ruining my whole life in cold hearted way I should just die because I will never stop thinking about her and the camp. I ruined all my friendships in the past with alcoholism and finally had a sober clear outlet and I ruined it my new structure for positivity in my life with new friends. Now I mentally never will recover. 

Everyone from the camp will hate me because eventually she will talk. The decision will never be reversed all her friends from camp will talk and they will make everyone think I am evil just because of a stupid internet overreaction and our age difference. The fact I was on her side and giving her advice to fight real harassment and the staff that physically kept trying to touch the girls never got reported is a spit in the face to me. The worst part about this is I can't even bring myself to hate her because I saw her as if she was a kid of my own. I wanted an artsy type girl to mary or one that was into the outdoors or scouting and its all ruined forever. 

  
All I have is my body that is in good shape and people tell me a lot I am attractive now with all the fat loss and new muscle. It doesn't mean anything tho if im mentally destroyed and can't even function to go to work anymore or even talk to a girl that finds me attractive.  I will die alone with no kids and never have a cute wife with a lot of kids. I will never be able to visit that camp if I put my kids in scouts and its too much to handle. Knowing my dreams got destroyed this badly. I will never recover mentally and be haunted for life looking at all the stuff I have from the camp that I took pride in. All my pictures too mean nothing. All it shows is what I had and now currently lost forever due to my shitty actions by trying steroids for 3 weeks because I asked my trainer for an extra boost at the gym and what drugs would help the best to burn fat and recover my muscles the fastest. This all stemmed from the pandemic closing camp and giving me nothing better to do than use social media and the gym. 

 
Every summer its all ill think about is the camp and how I cannot work there. Knowing I was backstabbed by a 16 year old girl I had the most respect for and she did it over me just reaching out constantly about my mental state hurts so bad when there are actual people at camp that are way worse and physically harass people I had to report them even though she did not want to before in our previous conversations months ago. They are the real enemies to the scouting organization not me. I am just a 27 year old who wanted to stupidly save his staff relationship with a 16 year old girl that I mentored.

All I can picture in my head is all of the staff taking their staff pictures and having fun and I will never be there with them again. I also don&amp;#39;t even know if I can join another BSA camp or not depending on the level of what was said by the parents and obviously they are overprotective of their daughter who is 16 and contacted a 27 year old. Nobody will know it was in a wholesome way and never meant anything sexual or negative in our chats. I just tried so hard to salvage our friendship and looked like a crazy stalker because the steroids destroyed my mental state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This would never have even happened if we worked together in 2020 and the pandemic never happened. I felt the need to stay in touch with everyone after our season was canceled so badly. It is why I talked to everyone from camp in the first place even the young scouts and old staff members.  I had nothing else to stay happy about except thinking about the pandemics end and being back together at camp. I wouldn&amp;#39;t have even tried bodybuilding steroids either if my trainer didn&amp;#39;t recommend them. But I have nothing else to do with low job hours then to physically push myself . &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just hope they know there will be a time when my body will be found dead in the camp dining hall. Everyone will know how badly I was treated mentally and neglected when I vented emotionally to her and warned that I would become suicidal if I was banned. Im glad to know my emotions meant nothing to her and the camp. I am just disposable despite being one of the best people in my center. I did not have to get reported by her if she just waited the 2 weeks for me to become mentally stable again and rationalized not to bother her. She did not have to block me after pouring out emotion to apologize in our original chat even if it was annoying.  It was not the right thing to do she could&amp;#39;ve just told me to stop but instead cut off all contact and reported me for trying to reach out and let her know how bad my mental state was . Ruining my whole life in cold hearted way I should just die because I will never stop thinking about her and the camp. I ruined all my friendships in the past with alcoholism and finally had a sober clear outlet and I ruined it my new structure for positivity in my life with new friends. Now I mentally never will recover. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone from the camp will hate me because eventually she will talk. The decision will never be reversed all her friends from camp will talk and they will make everyone think I am evil just because of a stupid internet overreaction and our age difference. The fact I was on her side and giving her advice to fight real harassment and the staff that physically kept trying to touch the girls never got reported is a spit in the face to me. The worst part about this is I can&amp;#39;t even bring myself to hate her because I saw her as if she was a kid of my own. I wanted an artsy type girl to mary or one that was into the outdoors or scouting and its all ruined forever. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All I have is my body that is in good shape and people tell me a lot I am attractive now with all the fat loss and new muscle. It doesn&amp;#39;t mean anything tho if im mentally destroyed and can&amp;#39;t even function to go to work anymore or even talk to a girl that finds me attractive.  I will die alone with no kids and never have a cute wife with a lot of kids. I will never be able to visit that camp if I put my kids in scouts and its too much to handle. Knowing my dreams got destroyed this badly. I will never recover mentally and be haunted for life looking at all the stuff I have from the camp that I took pride in. All my pictures too mean nothing. All it shows is what I had and now currently lost forever due to my shitty actions by trying steroids for 3 weeks because I asked my trainer for an extra boost at the gym and what drugs would help the best to burn fat and recover my muscles the fastest. This all stemmed from the pandemic closing camp and giving me nothing better to do than use social media and the gym. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every summer its all ill think about is the camp and how I cannot work there. Knowing I was backstabbed by a 16 year old girl I had the most respect for and she did it over me just reaching out constantly about my mental state hurts so bad when there are actual people at camp that are way worse and physically harass people I had to report them even though she did not want to before in our previous conversations months ago. They are the real enemies to the scouting organization not me. I am just a 27 year old who wanted to stupidly save his staff relationship with a 16 year old girl that I mentored. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will be found dead eventually at the camp dining hall and nobody will know when it will happen&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"My first relationship ever was when I was 13, and the girl that I was dating was also 13. Early, I know, but everyone in our school was beginning to date at that age. We were a very happy couple, we kissed and cuddled, and we told each other how much we loved each other and gave each other gifts. I thought everything was going great. But all good things come to an end, and she wanted to break up with me.

The reason for this was because she felt that I was too good for her. And I disagreed with this as much as possible, because it wasn't true at all (I've had a very low self-esteem for as long as I could remember). She ended up breaking up with me, but I still didn't give up. I thought, that if I just kept asking her to come back to me, she would, and then we could be happy again, and do all the things we did before. I missed seeing her. So that's what I did. I kept asking over and over for her to come over because I deeply missed her. She didn't want to get back together, but eventually, she agreed.

Unfortunately, the relationship was beyond repair in both our eyes. We broke up, again, and we didn't talk to each other for several years.

Now, I realise what I had done, I kept begging for her to come back because of my own selfish desires, and she didn't want to. In the end, I made her give in to coming back to me, being blind to the fact that she didn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore, and yet I made her come back to me. And I feel absolutely terrible now for doing such a thing. The guilt I feel every day for the last couple of months is overwhelming.

Fast forward to 2020, I am now 16. I finally talked to her for the first time in 3 years, and I apologised for everything, and I told her that I had changed from the desperate, selfish kid I once was. She was a bit confused as to why I was apologising, but accepted it anyway.

I'm not sure if she has forgiven me, or if she was mad with me in the first place. Maybe she's forgotten what happened, and she'll remember it one day and realise all the dumb mistakes I made. I'm pretty terrified about how my past will affect my future, and especially if what I was doing was pressuring her to come back to me, and so we could kiss and cuddle again, how that would affect the rest of my life and my mental health.

I just don't know how to get rid of the guilt I feel every day. It was a long time ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. Am I just overthinking things? Or is this a reasonable thing to worry about?

TL;DR I pressured my ex to come back, we did, and it didn't work out, but I think we are still on good terms with each other, but now I feel guilt.

To my udder disappointment upon waking up in the hospital,  I hear the nurse say&amp;quot; he&amp;#39;s awake&amp;quot;. My wife enters the room and says to me &amp;quot; I&amp;#39;m leaving you and we are getting a divorce &amp;quot;. She turned around and walked away. I am now 51 years old. I have been married twice have two offspring from each marriage. I am basically homeless and don&amp;#39;t have anyplace to stay after this upcoming new year 2021. I talk to my youngest daughter everyday,  she is the only one that talks to me anymore.  Out of all the things I have been through , I think I am ok. I deal with my life day by day, don&amp;#39;t expect anything from anyone and just try to be a good person(whatever that is). I have a lot of things to say but feel l&amp;#39;ve said enough for now . No matter what happens in your life suicide is not the answer. Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This is a really, really, really, really long one...

I’ve always not been great mentally, tried to commit suicide several times before (mostly pills or at bad times blood loss/ or more simply tried to off myself with a coke overdose). this went on for maybe 10 years (since teens). stuff then happened that maybe ‘warranted/validated’ how i felt (i don’t mean to diminish anyone else’s feelings - just ‘warranted’ in my head). 

i ended up in a horrible relationship because i wanted to help my (sort of) girlfriend through her brother committing suicide. she gave me a black eye at that time - and i excused it - and we somehow ended up married, despite that abusive behaviour not changing. lost my nan (complications from regular surgery), mum - from cancer- in the space of a month. my mother in law (who was the gentlest most caring person i’ve ever known -and helped my wife be less abusive) then died. i miss them all so fucking much. after years i finally had the sense to push for divorce.

i switched antidepressants, but then i fell/had a first time seizure (possibly because of the new antidepressants). 

from that i had a brain haemorrhage. i lost most of my hearing (playing music/band/playing in shitty gritty clubs etc. was everything to me). it made me lose my sense of smell/taste (i loved food and cooking), and my brain just isn’t what it was. aside from music, then only thing that made me feel useful was writing, or joking. now i can’t spell, or read well. or find words easily. i get stuck part way through a joke that makes people laugh at me because i scramble for the wrong words and that’s funny in itself. from the head injury i’ve developed epilepsy, and have had seizures that have landed me in hospital.

i get so dizzy and nauseous that i can’t leave bed sometimes. or even get down the stairs. i get frequent night terrors. i’ve not been without a headache since three, nearly four years ago from the head injury. three years with a headache, a headache so bad it makes me want to smash my face into a wall, genuinely, and i mean this literally - there’s nothing else i can do with the pain - despite of every sensible pain treatment. i can’t take the pain. 

i was supposed to stop over at my childhood home from the divorce (got married very early 20s, with previously mentioned older woman - was supposed to just stop over till i found another place - before the haemorrhage). now i’m stuck in my childhood bedroom, incapable of doing anything, not being able to contribute anything. 

i can’t leave, i  can’t sleep, i can’t taste, i can’t smell, i can’t hear well, i struggle to understand words and conversation. and i always.have.an.excruciating.headache. 

the night terrors make sleep, which should be a rest, awful. but i can’t help it. i fall asleep part way through work (in a job i’m blagging, because it takes me so long to understand what i’m reading/hearing). i wake up, at my desk, feeling fucking terrified. and then having to push through the day (i’m lucky enough to be working from home).

i don’t feel like i can do it. i genuinely wish a seizure would take me out. that way no-one will feel responsible. i take my cocktail of epilepsy/pain meds four times a day. and every time think, what if i miss this one. what if i skip a day. this time will i stop breathing indefinitely, instead of having paramedics round to inject me and put a mask on. my dad said the reason my brother got sectioned (psychotic depression) was because that seizure kept him up all night.

,SuicideWatch,"Life is absolute hell. I hate it here. I don't have any reason to, I have a nice family I guess, and more than most people could ask for. When I think of that, it just makes me feel guilty for not having enough dopamine to function properly.

I've struggled with on and off self harm since 9th grade. Of course, my parents found out, it became a big deal, I found more discrete ways to do it. (Few burns to the thighs do the magic.)

I hate everything in my life. I feel so tied down, so horrible. I struggle with PCOD, and its entire package deal; I'm overweight and ugly, hirsutism is a freaking pain, medications work only to become useless 2 months later. I'll probably get diabetes in my 30s (given I survive till then lmao) cause it runs in my family too. Oh, and I'm 17. I hate high school stress. I used to be smart and nowadays no matter how hard I try I'm just not smart enough to make my Asian parents proud of me. I just can't anymore and I want to give up and run away from life. My parents expect so much from me (in a good way) and they feel like I have so much potential. And I feel so guilty for letting them down every single time and I don't even want to face them anymore. I feel so so guilty that I have tears running down my face as I write this.

What's weird is there's times when I feel okay. Not extremely happy, just okay and dissociated from my pain, for a good 2-3 days. Then the tinniest of triggers rips my entire emotions open and I'm back to searching up ""Painless ways to die"" (No, I don't want to contact suicide helplines, thanks). I've tried twice but I was too scared to actually just get it over with. I have an overwhelming fear of failure even when it comes to ending my life, apparently.

There's only two things that keeps me from actually just getting it done with.

1. I'm scared I'll screw up so bad that I'll end up alive and handicapped. And that is something I absolutely fear, because I'm a dancer. And dancing is the one thing that also keeps me going everyday. Jumping from a building only to screw my spinal cords and become a handicap is an everyday nightmare. Imagine not dancing for the rest of my life. No thanks, I'd rather die.
2. I have a 5 year old brother. And I love him so much that my heart feels full every time I see him. Yes, he pisses me off sometimes, but he loves me so much and the thought of leaving him just breaks me. He's literally my only anchor. The one person that I can't leave behind. I just can't, I love him so so much. I'm always in a dilemna cause I don't want to be selfish and leave him, but I just want to be selfish for myself and end the pain of life for once and for all.

worthless to society, the people around me, the people i really care for.

&lt;p&gt;i&amp;#39;m a 20 years old college dropout, living with my dad and my two siblings, freelancing from time to time just to give almost everything to my dad to pay the rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i used to have a hobby, i used to enjoy listening to music, i used to have fun with my friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t even know when things started to go wrong.
im just absolutely hollow.
worthless to society, the people around me, the people i really care for.
i just don&amp;#39;t want to be a burden to anyone anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i fell in love half a year ago, knowing beforehand it&amp;#39;s never going to happen; i&amp;#39;ll never tell her. i&amp;#39;ll just give up again because i don&amp;#39;t want to bother her anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;nothing really motivates me, because i have absolutely no goals in life. i&amp;#39;ve done everything i can imagine myself doing. i don&amp;#39;t need more, i just want to disappear, nobody giving a shit about it and just forget about me would be my greatest pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i don&amp;#39;t care about anything, i just don&amp;#39;t want to bother anyone anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i want to silently disappear, but how?
please, no fucking bull about anything else.
i&amp;#39;ve had enough.&lt;/p&gt;

I get angry too, sometimes about small things, I try to be calm but sometimes it spills out, like I find myself giving someone a dirty look when their back is turned or a harsh tone of voice, it scares me when I do this and I know it upsets others. Tried counselling, it was no help at all, just questions I didn’t have answers for. A psychologist from work diagnosed me with ASD which explains a lot about me (no idea about tone and volume of voice and how to express myself, absolutely no social skills). 

At 23 I'm still living at home with my parents. I dropped out of University after one year of a Nursing degree and they've never really forgiven me (rightly so, it was due to laziness on my part). Now I work a mediocre housekeeping job at a local hospital and they don't hide that I've been a disappointment to them. 

I self harm and have for years, in the last few months it's gotten very bad, my parents have noticed and my mother has gone ballistic about it.

They've both tried to be understanding and supportive but I think I've exhausted their patience.

I just can't deal with knowing I will never see that money again, right now.

,SuicideWatch,"Hello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5

&lt;p&gt;About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5
Years no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind. I just want the pain to end, I just want to not be alone, and want someone to hug me and tell me I’m valid.&lt;/p&gt;

After that she got angry. I start to explain it. She engages, but then blocks me. This happens like 8 times. After a while she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards'. Then I reply that I did change because I hit the gym 6 times per week, eat extremely healthy, quit smoking, graduated and starting my career. That's her cue to explode.

'You'll never learn how to live your life' 'Loser' 'Whiner' 'This is the same irrational behavior as at that concert when you were arguing with random ppl'...

My relationship with my family is not healthy backside i rarely talk to them even tho they're good ppl, Whenever we have to eat on dining room i only stay quiet cuz i dont have anything to contribute on the conversation or we have awkward silence which i feel so guilty for because i feel like  I'm the cause of that . I never had a deep or just a normal  conversation with my parents or anyone with my family I'm a super shy, quiet and reserved person

 Theres no one i know that knows me completely because  I'm not good at expressing myself

I only have less than 10 good friends at school 2 on my section but only surface level friendship i don't talk to any other of my classmates.  Online classes give me so much anxiety especially when reciting to the point i cant even recite i just go silent ... what more on face to face classes ughhh

My social media=Facebook is dead , I don't post anything cuz i don't know how or why it wouldn't get any likes anyways. I don't post selfies I'm ugly and insecure

I could write a ton of negative traits rather than positive ones 

i don't have anything good at but I'm only good at drawing I'm really into it, decent skills since I was 10 yrs old i became good at drawing anime girls but i rarely show off my drawings to other people which makes me idk 'why am i keeping this to myself' tho i want to share it with other people to see .... i just cant i don't know how I feel embarrassed for drawing anime girls and liking anime

It's like what I really love its embedded in my heart

But i know it wouldn't contribute for my future I cant even recite in class or write good essays or think critically or say something intellectually , i feel so stupid im simple minded 


To summarize: I rarely talk, I'm too naive and dumb for this world, has no social life so alone i wanna die im wasting all opportunities im fucked up no one likes me 

I always wanted to Improve! Better my relationship with my family! but no my body says no i stay silent because I'm shy

&lt;p&gt;My relationship with my family is not healthy backside i rarely talk to them even tho they&amp;#39;re good ppl, Whenever we have to eat on dining room i only stay quiet cuz i dont have anything to contribute on the conversation or we have awkward silence which i feel so guilty for because i feel like  I&amp;#39;m the cause of that . I never had a deep or just a normal  conversation with my parents or anyone with my family I&amp;#39;m a super shy, quiet and reserved person&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Theres no one i know that knows me completely because  I&amp;#39;m not good at expressing myself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only have less than 10 good friends at school 2 on my section but only surface level friendship i don&amp;#39;t talk to any other of my classmates.  Online classes give me so much anxiety especially when reciting to the point i cant even recite i just go silent ... what more on face to face classes ughhh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My social media=Facebook is dead , I don&amp;#39;t post anything cuz i don&amp;#39;t know how or why it wouldn&amp;#39;t get any likes anyways. I don&amp;#39;t post selfies I&amp;#39;m ugly and insecure&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I don’t know where else to go and have no one else to talk to about any of this, so I’m just gonna rant and ramble on here to get these thoughts out. As the first quote of the book/film states, “I’m thinking of ending things”. I think I’m getting pretty close to the end of my life, like I’ve always known that my life would be taken by my own hands. Its loomed over me my entire life. 

I’m 22 and my life is far more of a mess than the average young person in their early 20s. I’m a college drop out with no sense of direction or motivation to even try to find that within myself. I’ve never had a sense of drive and I’ve always known this about myself from early childhood, even though I’m probably one the most passionate and giving people that you could ever meet. My future already feels like it’s been decided for me and the outlook is not good. I’ve never been in a relationship and I’ve never even kissed anyone. Even though I considered myself and am considered by others to be attractive and have a great personality, I either have too many walls built up to let someone in or I’m just not anyone’s type. My relationship with my friends has felt extremely one sided for a very long time now, and some of these friends I’ve had since elementary school. I always have to ask to hang out and make the plans for everyone. I didn’t even get gifts from them on my birthday this year (not that I really wanted something, just the gesture that mattered). I do sooo much for others, but I can’t even remember the last time anyone did something for me that didn’t allow the other person to gain something from the situation. I can’t stand listening to trivial complaints anymore, knowing that their problems aren’t actual problems and it’s just normal young adult complications. Especially since if I were to voice my problems, it would be too much for them to handle. I was abused for many years by my stepfather and even though I was able to move out last year finally, he still has control over my life by keeping my mother from me while she’s jobless and carless (due to pandemic). Oh, and also because of this pandemic, everyone in my close family is jobless and financially in shambles. I was kept in a second house (mother in law suite) with barely any access to the outside world and was constantly monitored on cameras for 2 years until I was able to get a car and job to get away. Prior to this, I lived in Maine to finish my junior and senior years of HS so I didn’t have to live with my stepfather then. He even got rid of my cats while I wasn’t there and I never got to say goodbye to them. They’re currently starting a divorce, but even still, I haven’t been able to hug my own mother since March. And even though I’ve moved out, I just feel worse about the entire situation since I can’t help my mom. I’ve seen multiple therapist and it usually starts off ok for the first few weeks, but ends within the first few months because I wind up feeling worse about other aspects of my life. I’m a clinically depressed, paranoid Bipolar with ADHD and insomnia. I also have problems with addiction and have a dependency on weed that I can’t break. I’ve tried many types of medications, rehab, and antidepressants that all have side effects that I can’t work with. After all this and all this time I’m still alone and have no plans for the holidays. They really just serve as a reminder that I really am alone. These are just some of the examples of how hopeless and ridiculous my life has turned into. I really just see no point in continuing on when I already know things won’t get better and I can’t help myself anyways. Really the only thing that’s stopped me in the past is because I know what this would do to my mother, but I really just can’t keep going much longer.

&lt;p&gt;I’m 22 and my life is far more of a mess than the average young person in their early 20s. I’m a college drop out with no sense of direction or motivation to even try to find that within myself. I’ve never had a sense of drive and I’ve always known this about myself from early childhood, even though I’m probably one the most passionate and giving people that you could ever meet. My future already feels like it’s been decided for me and the outlook is not good. I’ve never been in a relationship and I’ve never even kissed anyone. Even though I considered myself and am considered by others to be attractive and have a great personality, I either have too many walls built up to let someone in or I’m just not anyone’s type. My relationship with my friends has felt extremely one sided for a very long time now, and some of these friends I’ve had since elementary school. I always have to ask to hang out and make the plans for everyone. I didn’t even get gifts from them on my birthday this year (not that I really wanted something, just the gesture that mattered). I do sooo much for others, but I can’t even remember the last time anyone did something for me that didn’t allow the other person to gain something from the situation. I can’t stand listening to trivial complaints anymore, knowing that their problems aren’t actual problems and it’s just normal young adult complications. Especially since if I were to voice my problems, it would be too much for them to handle. I was abused for many years by my stepfather and even though I was able to move out last year finally, he still has control over my life by keeping my mother from me while she’s jobless and carless (due to pandemic). Oh, and also because of this pandemic, everyone in my close family is jobless and financially in shambles. I was kept in a second house (mother in law suite) with barely any access to the outside world and was constantly monitored on cameras for 2 years until I was able to get a car and job to get away. Prior to this, I lived in Maine to finish my junior and senior years of HS so I didn’t have to live with my stepfather then. He even got rid of my cats while I wasn’t there and I never got to say goodbye to them. They’re currently starting a divorce, but even still, I haven’t been able to hug my own mother since March. And even though I’ve moved out, I just feel worse about the entire situation since I can’t help my mom. I’ve seen multiple therapist and it usually starts off ok for the first few weeks, but ends within the first few months because I wind up feeling worse about other aspects of my life. I’m a clinically depressed, paranoid Bipolar with ADHD and insomnia. I also have problems with addiction and have a dependency on weed that I can’t break. I’ve tried many types of medications, rehab, and antidepressants that all have side effects that I can’t work with. After all this and all this time I’m still alone and have no plans for the holidays. They really just serve as a reminder that I really am alone. These are just some of the examples of how hopeless and ridiculous my life has turned into. I really just see no point in continuing on when I already know things won’t get better and I can’t help myself anyways. Really the only thing that’s stopped me in the past is because I know what this would do to my mother, but I really just can’t keep going much longer. I will plan it out and leave nothing unsaid if it really comes to this&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I talked to my therapist today, he was the first therapist to directly address my grades and struggles in highschool. He was realistic and treated me like an adult, none of which the others have. I can't find motivation to go to any of my classes. I've always lacked that motivation but now it's especially strong given remote learning. I've skipped almost every class and what hasn't been skipped I don't turn in any work and am failing. He gave me a few options on how we should find a solution to this, and basically at this rate I told him I don't think I will ever get enough motivation to bring up my grades, I just don't care about school enough. It's not important to me and is awful for my mental health, I've wanted to kill myself hundreds of times over school, and have come close to really doing it (even making attempts but failing), albeit I didn't tell him that part. The most realistic thing for me to do is to either drop out and get a GED, or motivate myself to get the bare minimum of C's and D's so I can graduate. He told me with how my grades look, I'm not getting into any colleges anyways.

When asked what was keeping me from dropping out already, I told him basically nothing but the fact that it's not what my parents want. He told me to focus on what I want. And I absolutely want to drop out. I have since I was 12. 

While I was at the therapy yeah I was happy an adult could finally acknowledge that school just isn't for me and that there could be another option for me. It was a relief. But now I just feel lost again.

I feel like having a GED just means I'm a failure. I know it doesn't mean that, but after all the pressure that's been put on for me for so long even knowing that I'm not a failure, I'll still feel ashamed for it. Let's say hypothetically I do get my GED, what then? I start working? Who's to say I'm not so depressed I can't work either? What if school is a billion times easier than work? What if my anxiety and other issues like (suspected but undiagnised) Autism/Asperger's keeps me from being able to function? Nobody cares if you have a panic attack every day in school. They're forced to deal with you anyways. But if I have a panic attack every day at work? Won't I get fired? What's so hard about school for me anyways? I feel like I'm burnt out over school, but what if I'm just burnt out over life in general? Having to work won't suddenly change any of that if it's life I'm tired of. Even if I'm not tired of life, won't I get to that point eventually with working? Even if I don't start off with a full time job the idea of eventually having to work 40 hours a week is exhausting just from the thought alone, none the less actually doing it. People always tell me that highschool was the easiest time for them. I'm not bullied or abused or anything like that. I should have like literally the most perfect life, and I would if I didn't have mental issues. If I can't handle highschool how am I supposed to handle the real world?

Life (for me, anyways, and for many others) just seems awful no matter how you spin it. When I was suicidal before today, it was short term. Guilt over being a failure in my classes. Now I'm suicidal over the long term. What is there to look forward to? Is it really anything worth staying for? I keep telling myself that the moment I'm an adult I'll buy a gun so I can kill myself, and then that's the end of it. Life just seems exhausting and even more so for someone like me, who gets drowned out by the system and tossed to the side like litter because it wasn't made for me.

,SuicideWatch,"I restarted a job I hate because I was getting pressure from my parents to make ""doctor"" money. 

For some context, I graduated medical school and started a residency training program but didn't complete it. I completed enough to still get a license to practice medicine. However, I can't be board-certified and that is the big buzzword and criteria to get employed as a doctor these days. I saved my life by walking away from that residency training and the only reason I was able to do that was because I had this epiphany in the midst of suicidal thoughts--it's not my life that I hate, it's just this current life/work environment and I have a choice to walk away from it. I didn't want to be another dead doctor statistic. The trade-off was that I'd have to find some other way to pay back all my loans. Long story short, I tried some stuff and it didn't work and covid hit and for some stupid reason, I decided moving back in with my parents would be a good idea as they'd become more supportive of me since I got diagnosed with depression in med school.

Anyway, I've been home for quite a few months now, trying to set boundaries with my parents and pushing back on their pressure for me to be a real doctor. I do currently work part-time but not as a doc and I have some other income so this allows me to live month to month (not ideal) including being able to pay rent to my parents and paying back a little of my student loans each month as well.

So I finally caved and restarted this job I hated but makes closer to doctor level money. It's only my third day. First 2 at the office and today and likely tomorrow doing lots of paperwork. I've been trying to stay neutral about it but today as I was filling out the tedious paperwork, I noticed more stress starting to creep in... anyway spiral to why not just kill myself? We're all gonna die one day or another? Why not now? It seems so silly to kms over this and it is. And I won't do it.

&lt;p&gt;For some context, I graduated medical school and started a residency training program but didn&amp;#39;t complete it. I completed enough to still get a license to practice medicine. However, I can&amp;#39;t be board-certified and that is the big buzzword and criteria to get employed as a doctor these days. I saved my life by walking away from that residency training and the only reason I was able to do that was because I had this epiphany in the midst of suicidal thoughts--it&amp;#39;s not my life that I hate, it&amp;#39;s just this current life/work environment and I have a choice to walk away from it. I didn&amp;#39;t want to be another dead doctor statistic. The trade-off was that I&amp;#39;d have to find some other way to pay back all my loans. Long story short, I tried some stuff and it didn&amp;#39;t work and covid hit and for some stupid reason, I decided moving back in with my parents would be a good idea as they&amp;#39;d become more supportive of me since I got diagnosed with depression in med school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I&amp;#39;ve been home for quite a few months now, trying to set boundaries with my parents and pushing back on their pressure for me to be a real doctor. I do currently work part-time but not as a doc and I have some other income so this allows me to live month to month (not ideal) including being able to pay rent to my parents and paying back a little of my student loans each month as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I finally caved and restarted this job I hated but makes closer to doctor level money. It&amp;#39;s only my third day. First 2 at the office and today and likely tomorrow doing lots of paperwork. I&amp;#39;ve been trying to stay neutral about it but today as I was filling out the tedious paperwork, I noticed more stress starting to creep in... anyway spiral to why not just kill myself? We&amp;#39;re all gonna die one day or another? Why not now? It seems so silly to kms over this and it is. And I won&amp;#39;t do it. I&amp;#39;ll just wallow more in this and grit my teeth through this work so I can make the stupid $ to feed back into the system. But the thought of suicide is relieving. The thought of just walking away from all this responsibility.

My dominant shoulder is down and it is making it very difficult to even care for my children.

Not being able to really do my hobbies or take care of my children has made my depression almost unbearable. I was so down that my boss came in on his day off and brought me to the ER because he was concerned that i was going to take my own life. Had it not been for my wife and kids he wouldve been right. I've been insanely depressed and still now just want to lie down in my bed and give up. I am not giving up because as i said previously i have my wife and kids that i need to stay around for.

Due to my depression more than my injury ive been out of work for almost a month, so far my employer has been able to work with me to make sure i dont continue down the path of depression and self harm but there is always the fear that it wont last and eventually i will be let go. It looks like my shoulder is going to take at least another 6 months to under the perfect conditions before I can even use it again. 

With that being said i know a lot of people tell me to turn to God because i am quite religious, my issue with this is that for the first time since i first went to Acquire The Fire (a big three day event that focuses around Christianity) I dont feel the embrace of God that i once felt, Ive been longing for the feeling that i felt standing in front of the David Crowder band singing ""How he Loves"" with my eyes closed, its been over 10 years since i went and i never lost the feeling i gained that night until recently. As much as it pains me to say I feel like im slowly losing my faith with nothing working to stem the bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;I hang on to the idea that things will probably fall apart by the time I’m 30, and that when everyone I love is gone or abandoned me, I can finally take my own life and have peace at last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working non-stop to avoid ending up like them. It was my plan to have a family at 24. But all relationships have failed. And my social life has gone to zero. I’m just tired of working for nothing. There is no point.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"I (20F) often get bullied by the rest of my family (I have four brothers, only girl). For one reason or another, everything is always my fault. 

First off, my oldest brother (32M) wrote me off for good last year because he asked me to give his ex girlfriend’s belongings back to her. He would do this a lot, and one time he asked I didn’t have the time (I was a caregiver and had a 12hr shift). He told me that since he co-signed for my car that I should’ve had his back, and said I wasn’t family.

My two other brothers (26M) (24M) live with him and are basically sheep, and took his side. I found out that the 24 y/o actually agreed with me, but didn’t have the guts to say anything. 

The 26 y/o sexually assaulted me when I was a child, and was horrible to me for years. He just apologized for everything a few months ago, so I guess he’s trying to make amends.

My youngest brother (19M), I thought, was my best friend. We frequently get into arguments because he doesn’t have a car and I always take him everywhere. I honestly don’t mind, but he gets into these moods where it seems like my very existence is a bother to him. Last week after we got into an argument I overheard him telling my dad how annoying I was, and I’ll admit, it hurt me. I take care of him like my own (my mom left us when I was 15- she was a drug addict and child abuser).

After the argument, I told my dad that I wanted to die because everybody around me hated me. He said “why would you do that to me?” and criticized me for not getting any help. I did make an appointment to see a psychiatrist, but I don’t know if I can make it to Sunday. Nobody has checked on me all week. I could’ve killed myself two days ago and no body would’ve noticed.

so i'm ready. i have stockpiled my xanax, i have alcohol, i have my antidepressants and other random medications. i wouldnt even be writing this if it were not for how afraid i am i might survive. i already survived an overdose once and the pain is... terrible, but i have no choice.

,SuicideWatch,"The last time I tried to kill myself was 7 years ago, in July 2013. After treatment, I started creating more advanced career goals to keep my mind off the loneliness and isolation I felt from the new people I was supposed to be friends with, in a place I never had a choice to be in. I felt like striving to complete those tasks would put me in a better place than where I was, and I was right financially. But my family just left me off here and destroyed my group of close-knit friends I had had. And the two times I complained, I was told it didn't really matter. 

These days I hear ""That must have been really hard"". Bitch, why couldn't you tell me that then? Due to that response, I figured being heartless and callous was the supposed norm. Your friends, your relationships, they don't matter. Previously, I had a great happy group to trust and rely on. And then, in the blink of an eye, all those friends and connections disappeared. Even when I was asked if I would prefer to keep them, and I said yes. So I sold out my family and friends. So why invest again? Again and again, the moves were chaotic. I never really felt that I would finally feel that happiness I hear other folks talk about. 

I tried to recreate a new social circle, spending years and years to get to know these folks well, or so I thought. Then, on the same day, both my best friend and ex-girlfriend lied/omitted info to authorities, but there was no one left for me to prove it. I always had thought my friend would have had my back. I had his and got him out of several tight spots. And my ex had manipulated my living situation and independence throughout the relationship. It took me a while to realize I was right all along; you should never trust anyone. And I realize it was my fault for letting them sell me out.

It's been 7 years. I've advanced far enough in my career since the first attempt, but when I clock out of work, all I can hear is the voice I'm starting to imagine in my head. It isn't particularly comforting...constant berating, belittling...anything to motivate me to do something better, motivated by depreciating self-esteem. It doesn't help that I don't often talk to actual people anymore due to COVID. Just screens.

I have a bunch of mental health issues and probably won’t be able to continue seeking care and medication management because my mom makes too much for me to get state health insurance, even though I’m no longer her dependent. I &lt;em&gt;might&lt;/em&gt; be eligible for unemployment, but it only pays about 2/3 of what I was making after taxes and what I was making after taxes was barely enough to get by. On top of that, I can’t apply for work until mid-December since I can’t pass a drug test. I’m also not sure how I’m going to be able to pay back my loans given that I have no money and they’ll be drafted from my checking automatically. As if having no money wasn’t bad enough, I’ll now have negative money and have to pay for the privilege of having negative money. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like drinking a bunch and just driving my car into a &lt;a href=""https://image.made-in-china.com/2f0j00RKoalswtaQrq/Hot-DIP-Galvanized-Overhead-Electric-Steel-Power-Pole.jpg""&gt;heavy duty telephone pole&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

It ain't good enough because schools want nineties. The system isn't about how well you improve or how much you try, no, it is a system that compares you to others and caters to neurotypical people. I've had a literal breakdown in most of my classes after grade 9 at this point. 

Everyone tells me I'm lazy, when just existing feels like the most exhausting thing to do. I can't do more when I am barely hanging on by a thread. That 60 may look bad to most people, and it definitely isn't my peak performance, but I look at that and smile because of the 50 I got last week. Or because I didn't think I understood it at all, and I still passed. Yet it is never good enough. Never. And then the people around me make me feel lazy and ungrateful for having those thoughts- ""you live in a first-world country, there are starving people! Be grateful and grind harder!""

The worst part of it all is when you tell people about the stress you have and the thoughts you have, they'll just say you're too much a coward to actually do it. The loneliness I have isn't due to a lack of people, it's due to a lack of understanding. 

People say your worth isn't assigned to grades, then turn around and berate you for anything less than they see fit. Every time I enter class, all I hear is people comparing their grades. It hurts me because people call their 90s bad, but I am objectively doing much worse when I am truly trying my best. 

I'm just sick of it. I really am. I just wanna sign myself out. With the marks I have now, there is no way I am getting into schools because of these elitist policies. In my country, it's very hard to get a good job without a degree, and I am a girl so I will be greatly discriminated against in skilled trades.

The craziest part of this is that when you do the research, you'll find the average age of death for white autistic males is you guessed it, 39 years old. I've had suicidal thoughts most of my adult life. Two attempts. Both extremely close. First by cutting my wrists in a warm bath. Roomie found me. Saved my life. Second, years later, I was barricaded in my room with the cops at my door (on a wellness check). I told them I had a gun, which let me tell you, COMPLETELY changes the situation. TBefore it was all said and done, I'd opened the door and thrown the gun out in to the hall. I immediately changed my mind and dove after it at the same time one of two officers jumped on me to wrestle the gun out of my hands while screaming at his partner not to shoot me. He succeeded in getting the gun. I was handcuffed and put in a patrol car to be transported to hospital for psych eval. While sitting in the car the officer who had had his service weapon pointed at my head, came up to the car. He looked right in my eyes, crying, and he said ""man, I almost killed you just now. My finger was on the trigger, shaking, and I was deadlocked on your head"". 
Years go by and I'm involved in a horrible accident. A woman ran a red light, late for work, and t-boned me, tearing my car in half. Breaking my entire neck in the process. I was paralyzed below the neck for a short time, having an emergency surgery to try and correct it. Which by the Grace of God they did. However it just gave me partial feeling back, which I know is still great, but hard to live with when you're a drummer. I've played my entire life. Two very good signed bands. Father was a country star who got me in it early. He committed suicide a decade ago. Funny how that works. I've had three more surgeries the past four years. The last having a recovery window of 12-16 months. Having two steel plates, six pins, several multi level fusions, the pain is other worldly. I started using heroin after I figured out it was much easier to get versus going to the drs with the judgment, drug tests like you're on probation or some criminal. Expensive but easier to get. 
That brings me here. I want to die. I really, really do. I have nothing. I've lost everything. Relationships. Friendships. Family. Personal belongings. Everything. Gone. And I'm so tired of hurting mentally and physically. I might be able to fend this off if I was dealing with one or the other, not both at the same time. I don't know if anyone could. I've tried doing a bunch of heroin but I keep waking up. Every time I know I'm close to od'ing and I feel my self nodding off, I think ""this is it, the last deep sleep"". Then I wake up. Rinse and repeat. Fuck. I'm still here. 
I've read on hanging and with a 70% fatality rate, it seems to be the best method. I was always afraid of doing more damage to my neck, possibly paralyzing myself completely and living. That'd be my luck.

,SuicideWatch,"Hi,

I don't even know why I'm writing right now. Maybe extreme boredom, because I already know that nobody in here can help me.

I'm just another post, some words placed here and here that creates a sentence, a story. We're all that on the web, just words, sad ones.

Speaking doesn't help me, it never did. Receiving support ? Again, just words on a hopeless little screen. I've talked to a therapist for three years, it never improved my condition, neither the pills (SSRI). It ended badly, and as pathetic as I am I've tried to recontact her but she didn't want to see me again. Then I went to see a CBT therapist, but it didn't improved my symptoms either.

Now, I'm sick, I'm tired of talking, telling the same story, again and again, but nothing changes. I've followed every things they told me : go ahead rent a apartment and live by your own, go ahead go back to college (while I told bullying destroyed me, but I've followed what the first therapist said anyway but it went bad as expected), go to clubs, socialize.

&amp;#x200B;

I just **can't** socialize, I've been alone all my life, since primary school, I was all alone waiting for the playtime to pass, waiting it to pass, seeing all of the childrens playing with each others. Now it's still the same, I'm afraid of people, if I don't go towards them they NEVER go towards me. They don't give a shit about me, not a single fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the point of living then ? I don't feel any emotions, I don't feel anything since years, neither hate, neither love, neither happiness. There's nothing left in that brain, it's all dead.

I never worked, and right now I don't want to work at all ! Working, but for what ? To continue my existence ? What's the point ? We work to live our life, not just continue it.

&amp;#x200B;

I even have symptoms that are not on any websites or books : I can't stretch, you know the stretching when you wake up or when you're tired ? I can't do it, because it **disappeared** from my automatic part of my brain, it doesn't happen naturally, I have to do it ""manually"" but it doesn't work.

A lot of manual processes of my body ceased to function, because I'm always looking at myself from an outside point of view. Like if there was a mirror in front of my face, all the time. I can never be at peace. Like, when I'm stretching, suddenly **I know** that I'm stretching so it ceases to function. And I can't prevent this. Like a knife trying to cut itself, it's impossible but there's a force, forcing it to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't reach climax anymore, at the end there's a force ruining, crushing the pleasure, sweeping it away.

And that's a thing I think I always had : my mind wants to do the opposite ""I"" want, and it ALWAYS wins.

&amp;#x200B;

My SO and I had to move in with their emotionally abusive family in hopes it'd be short term (still here btw), then COVID hit and things just turned into a straight shit show it feels like. I've always been a homebody, but I liked my few outings I'd do, but now I can't really... I can't catch a movie randomly, or enjoy a nice meal at restaurant on occasion. Then April 2nd my younger brother committed suicide.. that has been one of the toughest things to go through. It stirred up a lot of weird, mixed emotions... I've suffered from depression for so effing long and I've thought about suicide so much in my life, that I just started hating myself for wanting to die after my brother. Like it's so hard to explain the mixed feelings about suicide now and after him dying like that, there's no way in hell I could put our family through that for a SECOND TIME! Like Jesus I'd be such a lowly, selfish, piece of shit for that... So I must persevere this sad life. And now my SO is questioning themselves (both of his grandparents are on their deathbed right now) and just going through it too. But now it's causing our 5 year relationship to be questioned. It sounds weird, but I understand where they are coming from. They want to feel more independent and like they can do things for themselves.
They feel like they cannot accomplish anything on their own. It was a hard talk, but I understood honestly. Can't hate people for wanting to better themselves.

My SO and I had to move in with their emotionally abusive family in hopes it&amp;#39;d be short term (still here btw), then COVID hit and things just turned into a straight shit show it feels like. I&amp;#39;ve always been a homebody, but I liked my few outings I&amp;#39;d do, but now I can&amp;#39;t really... I can&amp;#39;t catch a movie randomly, or enjoy a nice meal at restaurant on occasion. Then April 2nd my younger brother committed suicide.. that has been one of the toughest things to go through. It stirred up a lot of weird, mixed emotions... I&amp;#39;ve suffered from depression for so effing long and I&amp;#39;ve thought about suicide so much in my life, that I just started hating myself for wanting to die after my brother. Like it&amp;#39;s so hard to explain the mixed feelings about suicide now and after him dying like that, there&amp;#39;s no way in hell I could put our family through that for a SECOND TIME! Like Jesus I&amp;#39;d be such a lowly, selfish, piece of shit for that... So I must persevere this sad life. And now my SO is questioning themselves (both of his grandparents are on their deathbed right now) and just going through it too. But now it&amp;#39;s causing our 5 year relationship to be questioned. It sounds weird, but I understand where they are coming from. They want to feel more independent and like they can do things for themselves.
They feel like they cannot accomplish anything on their own. It was a hard talk, but I understood honestly. Can&amp;#39;t hate people for wanting to better themselves. But I just feel lost, can&amp;#39;t formulate any words to describe my feelings. I don&amp;#39;t want to lose more people in my life. Can something go right for once? If there&amp;#39;s a God, please don&amp;#39;t take this person away from me too.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"For me at least, my depression and suicidal thoughts takes the form that blocks off all base motivation, meaning, even if I want to get better, I can't by trying harder. What's worse, is I am behind in schoolwork because the suicidal thoughts and depression make it impossible to get schoolwork done. But I am supposed to take more breaks and shut off my brain. But to do that I need to get more behind in school work. It's so fucking hard.

I hate to say this, but this dilemma literally gives me no way out. I do not know what to do. Trying harder to get work done ends up making my brain just sorta crash, and causes stress problems which fuel depression and suicidal thoughts, and make me unable to work on stuff effectively the next time I work. But not working on school makes me get more behind, become more suicidal because I realize i am unable to get work done, and do not get anything done, but it gives my brain the rest it needs- just not the amount it needs. And I can't do anything about it, like, if it was just stress, i could power through it, do whatever it takes, but my brain just breaks when i try to do that, because there is no mental energy and the base-level motivation is impossible to get. And even if it does work to force myself once, I know it will get worse the next time i try from experience, making staying up to date in school basically impossible. Online classes makes it worse because, a. teachers don't know how to teach well, so i can't easily absorb info like i usually did, b. my hindsight bias, and lack of cognitive function and memory stemming from depression and insomnia make me retain like 50% of the info i normally would, and like 50% of the natural connections i should make. I need to somehow break from school and improve my mental health, but, im in high school and i can't drop out. Working on school makes me suicidal now. The sad part is, most of my teachers are pretty good and the online situation makes the class have less assignments and pretty much infinite time for assignments, which would be better than me just going to school normally, but i still have huge trouble. I can't join a study group because of corona, i am basically trapped in this stupid situation, where i know i won't suicide, but school makes me suicidal and worsens my condition, but i am left all alone to learn the content anyways and get the work done. I am losing a competitive internship i got that i really wanted, because of my declining mental health, I kept up with the work for the longest time, but because it was work i got suicidal thoughts trying to work, because i got suicidal, i couldn't focus and fell behind ultimately just withdrawing. I am literally in an impossible situation, and I know i am (or was pre-depression at least) incredibly smart, but because it affects my ability to learn so much and do academic work, i can't learn. It is so frustrating, i have tried literally everything i can do from a mindset perspective, and i don't have an obvious idea or habit to solve like it is in some cases, so i have no idea what is healthy anymore and what is not. I literally can't solve my way out of this problem through my own thoughts, and i'm pretty open-minded. I probably deserve this since in the past i have done some pretty shitty things. but i wish i could move on because i recognize that I am not that type of person anymore.  


Also fuck, in ap psychology i learned melatonin is a terrible thing to take as a sleep aid. If you don't take it the same time every night and go to bed at the right time, it screws up your circadian rhythm which effects sleep and everything. No wonder medicine stopped working eventually, and sleep problems are worse than ever before (aside from depression obviously, but that wouldn't give me weeks of insomnia).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, i have kind of given up on life from a non-suicide perspective. Like I won't suicide, but i probably won't do anything either, which might get me kicked out. If i get kicked out, i might suicide maybe, but doing so when family is here to support would be dumb, but like it's impossible to keep up with school. At least i'm a senior so this is my last year. Probably should not have kept suicidal thoughts to myself for a year as they slowly debilitated me i guess, but in fairness i also am pretty open minded to new ideas, so i felt like self help would be an option, and was disillusioned that trying harder would somehow make everything ok, and that moving forward was a necessity, even though i knew base motivation was the problem and no matter what i tried it kept slowly declining.  
I know all my problems effectively, or realize them when they come up, because i am way to self conscious and indecisive (i used to be decisive though), which makes it worse.

This is a pretty clunky rant i guess, idk if i'm one of the only ones caught in this sort of loop rn though or not. I wouldn't call my circumstance exactly common, but definitely not that rare i think. 

If someone read this through I appreciate it because it was a pretty clunky rant which probably took some time to read, and someone understanding and reading it would just make me feel better i think for some reason. If not pretty understandable given the clunky sentence structure lol.

I&amp;#39;ll put notes in them, and tell them not to open it until the next day. But I&amp;#39;m giving the gifts to them in may. In April I&amp;#39;m going to just live my life happily. I&amp;#39;m going to do drugs. Get drunk. Do all the things I want to do before I die. Eat my favorite foods. Drink my favorite drinks. Then I&amp;#39;m going to be ready in may. In that month I&amp;#39;m going to go crazy. Get into fights. Break some laws. Steal some stuff. Kill animals. By doing that i won&amp;#39;t be able to go back. I&amp;#39;ll be filled with so much regret I&amp;#39;ll have to go. Plus if i don&amp;#39;t kill myself I&amp;#39;ll just go to jail and have to live with the shame of what I did. Then I&amp;#39;m going to do it. I&amp;#39;m going to get the needle. I&amp;#39;m going to mix my drugs. I&amp;#39;ll have bought fentanyl. It&amp;#39;s cheap and deadly. I&amp;#39;ll put it in my arm, and I&amp;#39;ll finally be free.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"Yesterday I got pretty high off an edible.

I can't remember when was the first time I thought about killing myself, but I know it was over a decade ago. I have vague memories of when I was around 5 and I tried to jump off of my balcony one night. That memory lived in my mind as a funny story about how I sleep-walked and how weird and hilarious it was; apparently I was asleep when I tried to jump. My dad saved me. Not a lot of people know this story - or if they do, I only let them see the funny side. I felt confused. Like my memory wasn't my own.

I remember when I was 14 I had a huge fight with my dad that left me in tears. I was left alone in the house. I remember going to the kitchen and desperately looking for a knife. When I found one I pressed the sharp edge onto my wrist, but I didn't let it slide down to cut. I felt shame. Like I was trying to prove something to someone.

This year I attempted for the first time.

It's weird to say ""for the first time"", as if there were more to come.

It was March, before the pandemic. I cut with a kitchen knife for the first time. I had a flashback to when I was 14. I wasn't sure if my intention was to kill myself or not, but I wanted to feel pain and see the vibrant red dripping down my arm. So I did. I just needed to figure out if I needed more. Was this it or was there anything still holding me back? I was standing on the kitchen floor, so I remember walking to my room to lay down on my bed so it'd be easier for my roommates to clean when I bled to death. I didn't do it. I had a moment of clarity and called my mum and cried on the phone with her for hours. I just screamed into the phone, no words, just sobs. We weren't in the same city, so she heard me crying from kilometres away without any way to help. It must have been torture. She called my aunt and uncle who lived about thirty minutes away to check on me. She stayed on the phone with me the entire time until they arrived. I felt guilt. Like I was the worst daughter for not killing myself in silence, but begging for help.

,SuicideWatch,"When I was 13 yrs old and in the 8th grade I was an overachiever in everything- first in studies, spell bee competitions, art, dance, karate, even singing. But i had to transfer from a metropolitan city to a very small city and had to change schools. Yes you are absolutely correct if you are thinking that i could not make any friends and literally went into depression after a year in the 9th grade. Due to this transfer , i was forced to discontinue all my classes like karate and etc...i hated it but i was a mentally strong girl. i joined this school mid semester and still performed outstanding in my academics and i was praised for that by evry1.

the twist of my life came later when everyone had formed their friend groups but no one was interested to involve me in. it was understandable, cuz they had been together for the past 10 to 12 yrs but no matter how hard i tried, i was never a part of anything. being good in academics led to many jealous and rebellious classmates who were always passive aggressive to me. the biggest mistake was to enter a group where i did not belong and then i was given a tag of ""introvert"" even though i was not one. i have no problem with being an introvert but this was wrong. it made me confuse my identity. as time passed by, i began to lose interest in studies i was always worried about what other people will think of me at school. i became a nervous and an anxious student. i could not even raise my hand to answer in the class. i tried to be away from evry1 at school and had my lunch break alone. 

Eventually, my academics went so low my marks were average and below. i did not know what was happening . i got yelled at at home, school and tuition classes for my low marks. so one day , when my mom was out , i was all alone and crying, i took a plastic bag and tried to get away by suffocating myself. i failed to do  it and felt so scared and embarrassed that i quickly hid the plastic bag when my mom came and pretended that evrything was normal.

this happened again .

by the time i got to 10th grade next year i had already committed suicide twice, i used to be depressed most of the time and pretended to be happy. somehow i studied for my 10th yearly exams (they are very important exams) , then this pandemic happened and the exams were stopped midway. thanks to the marking scheme i secured a decent %age. 

but thats not all.

now i am 16 and in the 11th grade i am studying for my pre medical exams i want to be a doctor, i have dreams...but ..but idk...6 months have gone by and i am not able to perform well i am so scared and anxious and have suicidal thoughts every now and then. and yes i transferred yet again to a different country away from the scary past i had , and i dont want to make this new place a suicide area again ..no... otherwise i wont be able to live in the same room where i had decided to end my life...i did that for a year and it was the most difficult thing ever.. i dont know how many will read this and relate to it...but its just that i want people to talk to ...why am i so fucking alone in this world of 8 billion fools????? someone just give me some carbon monoxide plis...just end this strife all prob will end and i will have a happy ending",,False,,0,False,"ok so...i have never written to anyone about this but here is my situation ,,,i need people to reply quick",[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jxoadz,False,dark,0.66,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,,,False,,,{},,True,,1605904699.0,text,0.0,,,,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;When I was 13 yrs old and in the 8th grade I was an overachiever in everything- first in studies, spell bee competitions, art, dance, karate, even singing.

&lt;p&gt;the twist of my life came later when everyone had formed their friend groups but no one was interested to involve me in. it was understandable, cuz they had been together for the past 10 to 12 yrs but no matter how hard i tried, i was never a part of anything. being good in academics led to many jealous and rebellious classmates who were always passive aggressive to me. the biggest mistake was to enter a group where i did not belong and then i was given a tag of &amp;quot;introvert&amp;quot; even though i was not one. i have no problem with being an introvert but this was wrong. it made me confuse my identity. as time passed by, i began to lose interest in studies i was always worried about what other people will think of me at school. i became a nervous and an anxious student. i could not even raise my hand to answer in the class. i tried to be away from evry1 at school and had my lunch break alone. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, my academics went so low my marks were average and below. i did not know what was happening . i got yelled at at home, school and tuition classes for my low marks. so one day , when my mom was out , i was all alone and crying, i took a plastic bag and tried to get away by suffocating myself. i failed to do  it and felt so scared and embarrassed that i quickly hid the plastic bag when my mom came and pretended that evrything was normal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this happened again .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;by the time i got to 10th grade next year i had already committed suicide twice, i used to be depressed most of the time and pretended to be happy. somehow i studied for my 10th yearly exams (they are very important exams) , then this pandemic happened and the exams were stopped midway. thanks to the marking scheme i secured a decent %age. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;but thats not all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;now i am 16 and in the 11th grade i am studying for my pre medical exams i want to be a doctor, i have dreams...but ..but idk...6 months have gone by and i am not able to perform well i am so scared and anxious and have suicidal thoughts every now and then. and yes i transferred yet again to a different country away from the scary past i had , and i dont want to make this new place a suicide area again ..no... otherwise i wont be able to live in the same room where i had decided to end my life...i did that for a year and it was the most difficult thing ever.. i dont know how many will read this and relate to it...but its just that i want people to talk to ...why am i so fucking alone in this world of 8 billion fools????? someone just give me some carbon monoxide plis...just end this strife all prob will end and i will have a happy ending&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The illusory truth effect &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(also known as the illusion of truth effect, validity effect, truth effect, or the reiteration effect) &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;is the tendency to believe false information to be correct after repeated exposure. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hmm, i don&amp;#39;t mean disrespect towards God or anything, but lately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;i started wondering why is it that &lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"For the first time in 10 years I’m speaking “publicly” as public as this is on a throw away. For about the last 3 years I haven’t been able to wrap my head around why I’m still alive.

My mother was a single mother of four growing up, we lived in the projects of our small town, in a 2 bedroom so our mother in one room, the children in the other. I remember being happy and content with this since I was young and it was all I knew, we had a PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and computer she got from the office she worked in from her boss. She always made what felt like miracles happen on Christmas even though I remember her always stressing about money and working multiple jobs. So I don’t remember having real reason to complain or be upset at our living situation. All of the project housing was very close, community wise and literally in space. The next house over shared the front yard with us, in a square shape we were on the bottom of the square, they were on the right side of the square. We’d play football, kickball and other sports after school or on weekends, it was normal for me to go into our neighbors home, we knew them well my mother would babysit their kids sometimes. I don’t remember how old I was, roughly 8-10 years old, it was around 2 pm I was with a kid that always came around for sports, but I wasn’t sure which house they came from. He was showing me a trick on his bicycle or something and said he was going to get a soda from his place and offered me one so I followed it was just a 3 or 4 minute walk. When we got there his father said they were out but he could go to the gas station and pick some up, I was told to wait there and his son went with him. I didn’t think much of it because the TV was on and this gas station was maybe a 5 minute drive I’ve walked to it before. Someone else came in shortly after and said they were looking for the father, I said they went to the store and I was the sons friend. I don’t know what happened next, I don’t know how this man got my pants off or why I allowed it, I always fought with my brothers and was always vocal, but I froze while this random man molested me. I just remember pain, and blood in my underwear. I don’t know what was put inside of me. It felt like an hour went by but it was probably less than 5 minutes, he randomly stopped and walked out. I looked down and that’s when I saw the blood so I went to the bathroom and cleaned myself up. I began to walk home confused, still in pain, still with this frozen feeling. My mother was on the front porch talking on the phone when I got to my street and she asked me where I was, I told her down the street with a friend, and she told me not to go out of her sight without asking first. The rest of the day is a blur.

About 2 or 3 years later apartments were finish being built about a 5 minute drive from us, and my mother had been seeing a man for a year or so. We ended up moving into them with him, it was first year of middle school. I am now 11 or 12, I knew a lot of people at school, I had a lot of friends, I was the class clown. I had very bad eczema as a baby, and some of elementary school but didn’t remember it much it had cleared up since then. About 5 months into the school year, I got a really bad patchy scab on my cheek, in my first year of middle school when I’m already worried about my looks I remember hating going to school, sometimes wearing a bandaid over it. Not long after my skin was at its worst head to toe, I was pulled out of school to do online classes. From head to toe my skin was red, itchy, scabby, wet, dry, burning, I’d feel my skin rip in spots for moving. Doctors said it was hormonal and I’d grow out of it, some would prescribe steroids quickly and said they should work, some said it’s because of the dust mites in the carpet since the house in the projects didn’t have any carpets and I had to get use to it and I’d heal in time. My mother took a lot of time off of work, just missing work was very costly for her, just to get me to doctors, specialist, 2 or 3 hour drives sometimes. Not a single doctor could help, a new steroid with horrible side effects every other week, “have you tried not scratching, using fragrance free soap etc” common sense suggestions. The doctor appointment that stuck with me the most was during an allergy test, where they pricked my back to see what irritated my skin, and the doctor summed it up as “allergic to everything under the sun” and “top one thousand worst cases in the world” I remember holding back tears, at 11 or 12 years old, until I got to the car just from hearing that. After a long 3 hour drive back home, nothing changed, not a single doctor could help. At one point I was rubbing Crisco on my entire body after every shower, showering felt like hell. Not showering would make my skin even more raw and crusty, I was not allowed to share a room with my brothers because of the scratching noises I’d make in my sleep, or crying from pain when I was not able to sleep at all. I was moved to the couch downstairs, I’d have new sheets every day, because of all the oils and ointments I was using after every shower full body, and all the skin flakes that would come off of me that felt like I was laying in dirt. My mother’s boyfriend would make fun of my skin and call me a “lizard” because of all the dry skin flakes, or call me a “wolf in the night” because my crying sounded like “howling”. She never spoke much to it to get him to stop. My friends from school wondered what was going on, we’d talk through Facebook sometimes. Until we were prescribed a really strong steroid that cleared me up within a week, I remember having so much hope, and being so happy. It cleared me up over the summer, and I started the next school year in public school again. Incredibly happy to see my friends, to not feel pain every day. And about 4 or 5 months into the school year, this happened again. Even worse than before somehow, I wrote my first suicide note without having any plan on how I’d do it. I just felt hopeless, the pain and suffering I felt overwhelmed me every day. Eating hurt because the skin around my lips would rip and burn, showering was horrible, doing any activity or seeing anyone was painful, sleeping was impossible, I couldn’t focus on online classes. They ended up having a teacher from the school come to me to teach me. And it repeated, doctor visits, no medicines or any kind helping, my mother being beat by her boyfriend from time to time, him hitting us with our mother’s encouragement over small things, him breaking our Xbox and Xbox controllers at 12 am when he was losing on call of duty screaming over voice chat, while being 30 years+. This went on for 3 years, my skin getting better, I start the school year in public school hopeful, just for my skin to become horrible again and again, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. I passed each year, out of what felt like pity, I wasn’t doing well on test, I wasn’t paying attention, I couldn’t do work by myself, I wasn’t learning. 

And just like that, during summer my skin clears up, strong medicine, I’m about 14 or 15 and high school would be next. Since I was always home I had a big online presence, I was always on the landline talking to a friend, messaging on Facebook, or on voice chat. We had a family ipad I would fall asleep using sometimes, in the living room on the couch. My mother would dedicate losing sleep for her 9-5 office job to go through my Facebook messages and question me about them later, she would listen to my phone calls outside and question me. Constantly invading my privacy and making me feel unsafe, she would tell me I’m lying about stories I told to my friends about her boyfriend, lying about stories about abuse verbal and physical. It felt like she was beginning to hate me and I wasn’t sure why. I was the 2nd oldest, but would hit her boyfriend when he hit her. I would always try to help, while in pain already. I remember waking up to him choking her, my siblings went downstairs in fear and just sat there, I went in and jumped on his back trying to help her. I was always loving and helpful. But I was still being treated like shit by her. She wasn’t like this to any of her other 3 kids. Over the summer she left her abusive boyfriend and started seeing someone else, he wanted to move about 6 hours away, we ended up doing this after a couple of months. I was able to say goodbye to friends and begin high school in this new town. All I had were my friends it felt like, I was able to keep in touch online but I felt like I was losing everything. After a few months in school my skin started getting bad but not bad enough to where I couldn’t handle it, we had found an oil with a steroid in it that kept my skin at a moderate level. A few patches but nothing horrible. I was doing horrible in school, as I didn’t learn a lot during middle school because of my learning situations. I didn’t want to be there, I’d breakdown and people would notice. One day I just stopped going, I told my mom I wanted to work on getting my GED, she was against it but I wasn’t going to go back. At this point she’s still listening to my phone calls, hitting me and pulling me off my bed in the morning, constantly gaslighting me, kicking me out then when I find my way back to my hometown by taking buses she calls the police on me saying I’m a run away, so I get taken back. She would lock my shoes in the trunk of her car so I couldn’t go anywhere throughout the day, while telling me she also didn’t want me there, telling me I couldn’t eat the food in her house, etc. we had a court hearing about my truancy from school, and the judge we spoke in front of agreed I could begin adult education classes to get my GED. So I was taking the bus every day for that going to the local college.

I’m 16 now, I visit my hometown and see some friends I haven’t seen in a long time since moving away, I don’t remember how this was planned or how I got there because I was broke and constantly fighting with my mom but I remember being happy. I was with my closest friend I’ll call her K, we always talked on Skype, phone, kept up and talked for hours. I didn’t have a friendship like this with anyone else at this age, able to talk for hours non stop. She stayed with me the longest on my final day there while I was waiting for my ride, it began raining, and since she had to bike home from the coffee shop we were at we agreed she should go before it rained harder. This would be the last time I ever saw her. Every secret, embarrassing moment, happy moment, sad moment, anything in my life, she knew. And vice versa. About 3 months later I get a call from her boyfriend, one of my friends, I set them up since they told me they liked one another privately. Telling me she was hit by a car and flown to a hospital, I’m 6 hours away, 16 years old, broke, with no idea how to see my friend that’s in the hospital. I’m told she wouldn’t make it that night after a couple of hours, her boyfriend put his phone up to her ear while she was on life support and let me say final words. I am completely broken at this point, I don’t know what to think or what to do. I just wanted to be around friends. We were all on Skype the next day or two comforting each other, I got help with money to go back to my hometown and see friends. Attend the service, and try to move on. I ended up moving back to my hometown that year and house hopping. Sometimes homeless, I worked a basic cashiering job I’d walk hours to or ask around for rides.

It’s been six years since then, I watched my class graduate and saw how happy they were. I missed out on a middle school experience, and a high school experience. I see people now finishing college, beginning in med school, law, etc. I’ve worked decent paying jobs for someone without a high school education, and have a few friends here and there. I still talk with my mother online we’ve gotten better since not living together. I live with friends near their college. I have a girlfriend of three years, in the last 6 years I haven’t progressed in any career opportunities, education, happiness, or healing. At the end of the day all I can think about is my past. My skin still gets bad and I still find myself losing sleep and dreading having to shower. I never grew out of it like all of these highly trained specialist said I would. I recently found a medicine that is showing improvement, but I feel it’s still too late. I miss K more than anything, I lost pictures and many messages with her when my mother was going through all my messages, out of panic when I was 14 or 15 I deleted everything on my Facebook, messages, pictures, anything. I can never confront my mother about this I’m sure even now she’d blame it on me. I’ve missed out on so much, I’ve seen all my friends be handed cars by their parents, and easy paths to college and ways to pay for college. I don’t know why I’m trying when I’m not progressing and have no motivation to progress. I have no immediate family I speak to besides my mother online from time to time. I’ve been on my own for so long, and only feel happy when I’m with friends, able to help my friends, able to surprise my friends, able to give heartfelt gifts. I told myself long ago that if I wasn’t going to kill myself I was going to make others around me happy. But it doesn’t seem worth it anymore and hasn’t the last 3 years, no matter how many distractions I give myself, video games, voice calls, movies, at the end of the day all I can think about is all of these things that have happened to me, I mourn the loss of my friend every night, I have nightmares, I am having memory problems, I have this new medicine for my skin that may or may not be helping, it’s to the point where if I hear my roommates in the common area which is right outside my room, I won’t leave my room even if I have to use the bathroom, because I can’t even wear a fake smile anymore.

I have written 13 suicide notes, I have attempted suicide twice, even with my lack of education from school I’ve been a manager everywhere I’ve worked. I have amazing social skills, and am still the funny guy to be around, always making people laugh in any group I’m in. I feel like I have a good head on my shoulders, and I may not be book smart but I am street smart. And not existing through this constant pain and suffering, makes the most sense to me. Even if the cost is upsetting others at this point, it’s not fair to me to live this life for the sake of others. I’m not sure what I’ll do, I’m not sure what the solution is, all I’m sure of is I don’t want to exist and haven’t for a very long time.

I’m told she wouldn’t make it that night after a couple of hours, her boyfriend put his phone up to her ear while she was on life support and let me say final words. I am completely broken at this point, I don’t know what to think or what to do. I just wanted to be around friends. We were all on Skype the next day or two comforting each other, I got help with money to go back to my hometown and see friends. Attend the service, and try to move on. I ended up moving back to my hometown that year and house hopping. Sometimes homeless, I worked a basic cashiering job I’d walk hours to or ask around for rides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been six years since then, I watched my class graduate and saw how happy they were. I missed out on a middle school experience, and a high school experience. I see people now finishing college, beginning in med school, law, etc. I’ve worked decent paying jobs for someone without a high school education, and have a few friends here and there. I still talk with my mother online we’ve gotten better since not living together. I live with friends near their college. I have a girlfriend of three years, in the last 6 years I haven’t progressed in any career opportunities, education, happiness, or healing. At the end of the day all I can think about is my past. My skin still gets bad and I still find myself losing sleep and dreading having to shower. I never grew out of it like all of these highly trained specialist said I would. I recently found a medicine that is showing improvement, but I feel it’s still too late. I miss K more than anything, I lost pictures and many messages with her when my mother was going through all my messages, out of panic when I was 14 or 15 I deleted everything on my Facebook, messages, pictures, anything. I can never confront my mother about this I’m sure even now she’d blame it on me. I’ve missed out on so much, I’ve seen all my friends be handed cars by their parents, and easy paths to college and ways to pay for college. I don’t know why I’m trying when I’m not progressing and have no motivation to progress. I have no immediate family I speak to besides my mother online from time to time. I’ve been on my own for so long, and only feel happy when I’m with friends, able to help my friends, able to surprise my friends, able to give heartfelt gifts. I told myself long ago that if I wasn’t going to kill myself I was going to make others around me happy. But it doesn’t seem worth it anymore and hasn’t the last 3 years, no matter how many distractions I give myself, video games, voice calls, movies, at the end of the day all I can think about is all of these things that have happened to me, I mourn the loss of my friend every night, I have nightmares, I am having memory problems, I have this new medicine for my skin that may or may not be helping, it’s to the point where if I hear my roommates in the common area which is right outside my room, I won’t leave my room even if I have to use the bathroom, because I can’t even wear a fake smile anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have written 13 suicide notes, I have attempted suicide twice, even with my lack of education from school I’ve been a manager everywhere I’ve worked. I have amazing social skills, and am still the funny guy to be around, always making people laugh in any group I’m in. I feel like I have a good head on my shoulders, and I may not be book smart but I am street smart. And not existing through this constant pain and suffering, makes the most sense to me. Even if the cost is upsetting others at this point, it’s not fair to me to live this life for the sake of others. I’m not sure what I’ll do, I’m not sure what the solution is, all I’m sure of is I don’t want to exist and haven’t for a very long time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—sorry in advanced I did not plan to write this, so it may be all over the place and just look like a wall of text.&lt;/p&gt;

——

I’m 19. I’ve never had a job and I can’t drive. Getting a job, working, makes me extremely anxious. Driving makes me even more anxious. I feel like you can just die at any moment when driving. I don’t see it as relaxing or peaceful like most people my age do. 

I’m not allowed to leave my home. I don’t even live at home anymore. I live with my grandparent and they’re not willing to help cut off my parents because they’re religious and family is super important because of Jesus and other things. I’m an atheist. I do not believe in any god who can put people through this hell.

As a kid, I was not allowed to see anyone outside of school. No birthday parties or sleepovers. No going to a friends house after school. No seeing boyfriends outside of school. I was always too young to be doing anything. Or I was just too stupid. I’m extremely shy and anxious now as an adult. I will never be independent. 

I can’t leave to have a job, or drive, or see friends (I know we’re in a pandemic but still). I can’t even see my boyfriend of two years without being yelled at. I can’t cut my hair without being cussed out about it. I’ve never even been allowed to cut it. 

And I’m too scared to just leave. I will never leave because I’m paralyzed from the fear. I’m absolutely terrified of what my parents can do. The police will not stop them, especially my father. He owns several guns, has anger issues, and has pulled one out on my mom several times. He’s threatened to kill my pets. He’s threatened to leave me and my mom. He’s always been screaming about how we’re useless and they would often fight, screaming and screaming until they came into scream at me. Screaming in my face about how they hate each other. How much they hate each other. Both of them venting to me about how horrible the other one is. 

I will never leave. I won’t ever be forced to leave, as that’s already happened and I just couldn’t. I couldn’t leave. I’ve been told to leave multiple times but I can’t. My boyfriend has tried to get me to leave and live with him, but I can’t. Several friends have tried to help me leave but I can’t. I’m too terrified to do so. 

I’m thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend, because I’m never going to get out of here to live a life with him or anyone else. He isn’t my first boyfriend but he’s the first to know how bad things are for me. Our three year anniversary is on a Saturday this year and I can’t bring myself to even see him on it or near it. 

I’m thinking about pushing everyone away because they can no longer help me and I can’t keep acting like I’m not jealous of them. They may have bad parents too but they’re not afraid of their parents. They can work. They can drive. They can see people. They can cut their hair and their parents would fawn over them.

I’m in college, sure. I have 2,000 dollars in debt because my family won’t help me by bringing in tax papers I need. I think I’m going to drop out. I can’t pay off that money at all. I feel so stupid for even thinking about going to college. I feel stupid for even starting my classes. 

I’m just truly thinking about killing myself. I have no reason to be here anymore. Every day gets harder and harder. I don’t see any hope of anything getting better. I’ve been depressed and suicidal for years. It’s never been this bad. I’ve never been so scared and alone. I’ve never been more exhausted. I truly don’t want to continue living. I’m not happy. I’m nothing. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.

I think I’m going to give myself until the end of the next month. I want to experience Christmas and see my boyfriend again before I do anything rash. I’ve been clean from self harm for four years now. I really feel like relapsing. But if I do, my boyfriend will see and I don’t want to worry him about it. I don’t want to bring him more pain than I will. 

I’m just really sorry. I’m just so tired. I’m so drained. I don’t see a point in living here.",t2_8w847k12,False,,0,False,TW: I’m giving myself a month.

,SuicideWatch,"So I've been thinking through the process of natural selection. In a way, I've come to realize that the reason why narcissism is so prevalent is because it has become a method for those who survive the longest in life. Narcissists are naturally wayyy more resilient to things. It is only logical why narcissism is so common or why people develop narcissistic personalities. Unfortunately for me, I did not develop a narcissistic personality. Yes, I said unfortunately. I've come to the realization that because I am so neurotic, I literally will kill myself at some point. Not now, maybe not in the next 10 years, but I know I won't die a natural death, other than early death caused by accident(s). I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don't know this feeling. I feel suicidal and not at the same time. Ever since my antidepressants started working I've been trying to meditate and practice mindfulness, but I guess for some of us it may never be enough. My personality is fucked, and all I can do is try to change. I usually a really nice person, but when things overwhelm me or if things trigger my C-PTSD, I go haywire sometimes and it just feels out of control. I got into a stupid argument today with my mom over printing a bank statement because it brought back a lot of traumatic memories. I began to berate her because I was so angry at my dad. I basically felt insanely guilty right afterwards and meditated and apologized to her. 

It's strange to not know how much time you have left. I can't really trust my own mind, but it's all I have and will ever have. I think suicide as a phenomenon has its benefits and uses. Other species commit suicide too, so it's not limited to only humans. Suicide solely rules out those who had weak genes or epigenetics that triggered downregulation of genes. This way those who do pass on their genes are typically healthy in some way or another, just not as broken as us I guess.

So I guess, I will try, try, and try to keep living and push positively until that final breaking point. It seems that people typically don't like to see the bottle leaking(me letting my emotions out) once in a while. So why not just let it burst when it does. I think people should stop feeling guilty or making suicide look like a bad thing. It's the human paradox of wanting to ""help"" each other but not being able to even when you want to because healthy people's egos know when to prioritize themselves. This is why we feel that people abandon us and such. People need to protect their own sanity before they lend/share theirs to others, and that's OK.

It funny that when you get to this point in the rabbit hole. You suddenly understand why suicide sometimes seem, ""sudden"" and it slowly begins to feel enticing to join them.

It won't be tonight, probably not this year. 

But as long as these thoughts are here, I will try to fight them and see the positive. Until there are no more positives. Yes, I know everything is perspective. I've lived that, but there's a certain point of understanding where you realize everything is pointless and just feel like giving in.

,SuicideWatch,"honestly it's hard and I think I just need to put my feelings into words because they've just been stuck inside my head. 

over the past few weeks, I've had a very overwhelming feeling that I do not want to continue living anymore. For a number of reasons I won't get into. I do not believe that I will actively try to take my own life, but I'm just bogged down with this weight of not wanting to carry on or feeling a reason to live. I know I have reasons I should want to live for but I just can't bring myself to want to live for them. 

The only time it gets really bad is when I have panic attacks, and then i stop myself and try to meditate or listen to music and relax. My fiance has caught on, he asked me what's wrong. I confided in him, I let him know that honestly I feel like i want to die. He was very upset with this and worried. I understand that. He wants me to tell my therapist. I really do not want to. If i tell my therapist she will send me to inpatient and i do not need to be in inpatient. It will make things 1000x worse. 

So, idk what to do or how to make things better. Maybe I'm just stuck with this feeling and i shouldn't tell anyone.

ever since i was young, very very young, I've had these horribly sexually intrusive thoughts. about everyone. even family. i hated it. i couldn't stand it. i couldn't decipher whether it was normal.

over the years I've just went downhill. i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes around 2 or 3 years ago, and currently in the process of being diagnosed or null for ADHD. i have horrible anxiety here and there, you know.

i don't wanna be like this.

this is the first time i think ever I'm really truly realizing how shitty of a human i am. wow. 

this isn't overdramatic cliche either. I'd probably be locked away if i ever acted on some of the compulsive shit i think of. 

i can't help it. i wish i could sit down and do school work like a normal kid. i wish i didn't constantly think horrible thoughts.

suicidal thoughts, been there. suicidal attempts and self harm, been there.

that's not what this is about. this is about me wanting to rewire my brain to not think such fucking horrible thoughts. to not consider acting fucking stupid even though I'm too pussy (or smart) to do so anyway. to not be a drug fiend. to not be addicted to anything sexual in any way. being horny all the time gets boring and sad.

to be able to not think of something that scares the shit out of me and not being able to get it out of my head. 

to actually have the motivation to do so.

but you know what? tomorrow is gonna be a different fucking story. I'm going to wake up, forget that I'm breaking down crying right now because i can't balance my sexual life, school life, thoughts, mindset and mentality. 

because I'm fucking lazy. I try and try and try and try everything i CAN to just CHANGE MY VIEW. I have TAKEN LSD BEFORE. and still haven't gotten a single fucking scratch at the surface at trying to change my mind. it's like i jusf don't care.

i WANT to say that I'm being lazy and just not putting in the fucking effort but I TRY AND TRY AND TRY AND YET no matter what i do, the next day just resets everything. i don't want these compulsive thoughts. i don't want to be overly sexual anymore. i don't want to think horrible, gruesome, bloody, or scary thought ON REPEAT 24/7 SIMPLY BECAUSE I CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT. people SWEAR that just ""ignoring"" it works. or avoiding the thoughts. or preventing exposure. I've done everything in the book. it doesn't. fucking. work. it's like i see something mildly traumatic and i just, CANNOT stop seeing it in my head. 

same thing with sexual stuff. i am so overly sexual sometimes I'm scared for my mentality. 

I just....it's like my mind has no limits. it will do anything to make me uncomfortable and anxious. I'm over it.

,SuicideWatch,"I had a mental breakdown a year ago. I used to smoke way too much weed and cigarettes and I ate extremely unhealthy too for 9 years. On top of that I had just lived life without thinking clearly and just lived in the moment. I became suicidal. My mind was set on killing myself. 

Then I contact my ex who I dumped and she blocked me. In some random, dumb, depressed, idiotic, life-ruining impulse I made a new account and wrote extremely suicidal texts to her. She said she had improved a lot and I said. 'Fuck improving. I'm done with life. Pointless bullshit anyway. You still want my cat?'...

After that she got angry. I start to explain it. She engages, but then blocks me. This happens like 8 times. After a while she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards'. Then I reply that I did change because I hit the gym 6 times per week, eat extremely healthy, quit smoking, graduated and starting my career. That's her cue to explode. She writes an extremely mean message filled with hate, disdain and degrading stuff. 'You'll never learn how to live your life' 'Loser' 'Whiner' 'This is the same irrational behavior as at that concert when you were arguing with random ppl'... She also told me she would never reply again. 

Then it becomes chaos in my head. It was already chaos, but after that it just went overboard. I hate those insults so much. They repeat in my head all the time. I can't cope with it. I'm too emotionally weak already. I struggled to recover from my suicidal thoughts and this on top of it was too much. 'You'll never learn how to live your life'... Constantly repeating in my head. Flashbacks to arguing at that concert. Feeling even worse about myself. 

Initially fucking HATED her! She was 8 years older and came into my life and I never asked for it and then she can't even bring herself to end it without a bunch of insults that are so toxic for my mental health at that time! So I was fucking angry and wrote insulting messages back in the beginning. 

After that I changed though. I started to realize that I was in the wrong. I changed my tone and began explaining all the time. Begging to talk it out. I did this for like 4 to 5 months because I couldn't think of anything else. In the end I wrote an extremely personal e-mail to her workmail that got forwarded to her co-workers in which I called myself a piece of shit and more dramatic stuff 😓 I fully took the blame in that one. I still had one weak moment and wrote another message like a month later to her LinkedIn and that was it. 

I hate myself. I can't believe that this has happened. I hate that this is part of my life story. I feel like I should kill myself. What the fuck??? Those messages are also black on white.

I've officially ruined my life by being a crazy, deranged and idiotic stalker because I couldn't deal with those insults.",t2_6ntc2gj2,False,,0,False,I think I'm forced to kill myself due to my bad behavior,[],r/SuicideWatch,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jxib4r,False,dark,1.0,,public,3,0,{},2a7b5518-8e45-11e5-a506-0ed10b342609,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,3,,False,,1605846037.0,modmsg,[],{},,True,,1605874452.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.SuicideWatch,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I had a mental breakdown a year ago. I used to smoke way too much weed and cigarettes and I ate extremely unhealthy too for 9 years. On top of that I had just lived life without thinking clearly and just lived in the moment. I became suicidal. My mind was set on killing myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I contact my ex who I dumped and she blocked me. In some random, dumb, depressed, idiotic, life-ruining impulse I made a new account and wrote extremely suicidal texts to her. She said she had improved a lot and I said. &amp;#39;Fuck improving. I&amp;#39;m done with life. Pointless bullshit anyway. You still want my cat?&amp;#39;...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that she got angry. I start to explain it. She engages, but then blocks me. This happens like 8 times. After a while she says &amp;#39;you didn&amp;#39;t change a bit and only went backwards&amp;#39;. Then I reply that I did change because I hit the gym 6 times per week, eat extremely healthy, quit smoking, graduated and starting my career. That&amp;#39;s her cue to explode. She writes an extremely mean message filled with hate, disdain and degrading stuff. &amp;#39;You&amp;#39;ll never learn how to live your life&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Loser&amp;#39; &amp;#39;Whiner&amp;#39; &amp;#39;This is the same irrational behavior as at that concert when you were arguing with random ppl&amp;#39;... She also told me she would never reply again. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then it becomes chaos in my head. It was already chaos, but after that it just went overboard. I hate those insults so much. They repeat in my head all the time. I can&amp;#39;t cope with it. I&amp;#39;m too emotionally weak already. I struggled to recover from my suicidal thoughts and this on top of it was too much. &amp;#39;You&amp;#39;ll never learn how to live your life&amp;#39;... Constantly repeating in my head. Flashbacks to arguing at that concert. Feeling even worse about myself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initially fucking HATED her! She was 8 years older and came into my life and I never asked for it and then she can&amp;#39;t even bring herself to end it without a bunch of insults that are so toxic for my mental health at that time! So I was fucking angry and wrote insulting messages back in the beginning. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that I changed though. I started to realize that I was in the wrong. I changed my tone and began explaining all the time. Begging to talk it out. I did this for like 4 to 5 months because I couldn&amp;#39;t think of anything else. In the end I wrote an extremely personal e-mail to her workmail that got forwarded to her co-workers in which I called myself a piece of shit and more dramatic stuff 😓 I fully took the blame in that one. I still had one weak moment and wrote another message like a month later to her LinkedIn and that was it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hate myself. I can&amp;#39;t believe that this has happened. I hate that this is part of my life story. I feel like I should kill myself. What the fuck??? Those messages are also black on white. They won&amp;#39;t disappear. She can expose me 10 years from now.

,SuicideWatch,"My closest friend died back in May this year, and he was the only person motivating me to write and helping me find new people after my heart's been broken since 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

No one loves me. I'm a misanthropic autistic reject of humanity, ostracized for being the uncivilized barbarian that I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Constantly told that I should be locked up for the rest of my life because of how violent I appear. Locked up in the psych ward where I'm restrained to a bed for the next few days. I constantly think of revenge against hospital staff who tormented me, and friends who betrayed me, used me, threw me under the bus.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing is real. Everything is fucking fake. Does anything really exist? Yes, but I don't want to exist anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a province in Canada that's just a fucking lot like America now that our premier and his dumbfuck petrofascists and redneck supporters are privatizing our healthcare system.

&amp;#x200B;

It's too fucking expensive to get mental health treatment anymore. It fucking costs money, and it already stripped me of my sanity and morality. I fucking hate everyone and trust nobody anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I want all of human civilization to just collapse and fucking burn already. Be a post-apocalyptic marauder if I don't kill myself, so someone can just fucking put me out of my misery already.

&amp;#x200B;

I want nothing more than oblivion. I don't want to exist anymore. Whatever alien/advanced AI ""god"" or gods created this shithole universe are sadists worse than any mortal could ever be. Deceptive alien psychopaths if there's anything beyond our material existence, pretty sure they like to pretend to be spirit elves through DMT as well. Maybe that's why I've never enjoyed psychedelics. I see through the bullshit beyond the veil and the sadist alien gods don't like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking refuse all afterlives and reincarnation if any of that spiritual mumbo jumbo exists at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Love always betrays. Will never reconnect with my boyfriend who threw me under the bus as my mental health deteriorated as I failed to find the right help... just locked in the revolving door of the psych ward system.

&amp;#x200B;

My tormenters can enjoy their shallow ""victory"" over how defeated I am. I'll be dead and sparing myself the fate worse than death we all created for ourselves as this fucked up worthless species called humanity, and I'm glad we're going extinct. I hate you all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll finally be at peace in death. I plan on going out with either fentanyl or running a dirty old car in a closed garage, it's supposed to be peaceful.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want my tormented soul to rest. I'm painfully aware that for how much I wanted to be loved in return, at best I'll only be manipulated and used, and given ""tough love"" to fuck me up even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Love and beauty... what treacherous fucking deceptive lies and tools of manipulation and coercion it all is.

&amp;#x200B;

Miss me with the OpTiMiStIc NiHiLiSm as well. You guys are literally just a virtue-signalling cult of grinning martyrs.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing is worth anything. I should have been aborted, I wish there were screenings for autism so my torturous life never would have begun to begin with. Never had a father in my life either, just my dumb bitch of a mother who neglected me, and then my gullible idiot grandmother. Fuck religion for destroying my intelligence I thought I had... if I ever really had any to begin with and wasn't just a know-nothing know-it-all from day 1.

&amp;#x200B;

You all made jokes of me getting molested by my special needs teacher and gossiped and spread rumours about how I'd become a mass shooter. I even gave up my gun license and now you cunts slander me as a potential rapist. I hate sex, and nothing I could do even with how sadistic I am now, you all create your own suffering. I don't have to do shit because all your lives are fake and ready to topple like a house of cards once we wipe out our own biosphere, when there's no more food being delivered to your grocery stores, when you can no longer get healthcare, and so many calamities that you abominable hairless human apes deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

You all deserve death and extinction. That's the only redemption any of us will ever find, is our inevitable deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not speed it up? I fucking hate the fact I was ever born to begin with. And don't bother me with stoicism because I'm a broken emotional trainwreck all the fucking time, as much as I wished I was just an emotionless stonewall.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate everyone and everything. Nothing and no one is worth suffering for.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ready to fucking die. I'm already dead inside, aside from growing rage without friends to keep me in check. You'll all throw me under the bus when you can't pretend to help me anymore. You're all selfish, deceptive cunts.

&amp;#x200B;

I will die next year, or you all will regret the monster you all drove me into becoming. I have no fucking empathy for anyone anymore with how much you bastards gaslights me and treat me like shit, and expect me to be calm and docile so you can manipulate me and backstab me even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck you all. Fuck all humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care what fucking damn well happens anymore or how much I hurt people anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lonely because I'm an unsociable arse, and no matter all the therapy I'm going through right now, I can't be rehabilitated. You all invalidate me and call me lazy anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Pain has become a placebo in the absence of all pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

I only live to spite you all. But why even bother? It's all fucking useless. Fuck all your mind games of dominance to justify all your fucking narcissism. All 8 billion of you human bastards.

&amp;#x200B;

Why the fuck am I even writing and posting this shit? There is no real help.

&amp;#x200B;

And as I explained above, I'm not fucking going to the psych ward EVER AGAIN. And I'll know if you're actually listening to me or not if you recommend I be hospitalized again. You never helped me but betrayed me to going back into the corrupt and abusive mental health system, just to make yourselves look like better people than you actually are.

&amp;#x200B;

I'M FUCKING SAD AND ANGRY AND LONELY ALL THE TIME AND I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE. WHY IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING TO LET ME DIE INSTEAD OF KEEPING ME ALIVE TO FESTER IN MY OWN GANGRENOUS MIND.

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy isn't helping me, it's making me worse as usual.

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s too fucking expensive to get mental health treatment anymore. It fucking costs money, and it already stripped me of my sanity and morality. I fucking hate everyone and trust nobody anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want all of human civilization to just collapse and fucking burn already. Be a post-apocalyptic marauder if I don&amp;#39;t kill myself, so someone can just fucking put me out of my misery already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I want nothing more than oblivion. I don&amp;#39;t want to exist anymore. Whatever alien/advanced AI &amp;quot;god&amp;quot; or gods created this shithole universe are sadists worse than any mortal could ever be. Deceptive alien psychopaths if there&amp;#39;s anything beyond our material existence, pretty sure they like to pretend to be spirit elves through DMT as well. Maybe that&amp;#39;s why I&amp;#39;ve never enjoyed psychedelics. I see through the bullshit beyond the veil and the sadist alien gods don&amp;#39;t like that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking refuse all afterlives and reincarnation if any of that spiritual mumbo jumbo exists at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love always betrays. Will never reconnect with my boyfriend who threw me under the bus as my mental health deteriorated as I failed to find the right help... just locked in the revolving door of the psych ward system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My tormenters can enjoy their shallow &amp;quot;victory&amp;quot; over how defeated I am. I&amp;#39;ll be dead and sparing myself the fate worse than death we all created for ourselves as this fucked up worthless species called humanity, and I&amp;#39;m glad we&amp;#39;re going extinct. I hate you all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll finally be at peace in death. I plan on going out with either fentanyl or running a dirty old car in a closed garage, it&amp;#39;s supposed to be peaceful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I just want my tormented soul to rest. I&amp;#39;m painfully aware that for how much I wanted to be loved in return, at best I&amp;#39;ll only be manipulated and used, and given &amp;quot;tough love&amp;quot; to fuck me up even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Love and beauty... what treacherous fucking deceptive lies and tools of manipulation and coercion it all is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Miss me with the OpTiMiStIc NiHiLiSm as well. You guys are literally just a virtue-signalling cult of grinning martyrs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing is worth anything. I should have been aborted, I wish there were screenings for autism so my torturous life never would have begun to begin with. Never had a father in my life either, just my dumb bitch of a mother who neglected me, and then my gullible idiot grandmother. Fuck religion for destroying my intelligence I thought I had... if I ever really had any to begin with and wasn&amp;#39;t just a know-nothing know-it-all from day 1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You all made jokes of me getting molested by my special needs teacher and gossiped and spread rumours about how I&amp;#39;d become a mass shooter. I even gave up my gun license and now you cunts slander me as a potential rapist. I hate sex, and nothing I could do even with how sadistic I am now, you all create your own suffering. I don&amp;#39;t have to do shit because all your lives are fake and ready to topple like a house of cards once we wipe out our own biosphere, when there&amp;#39;s no more food being delivered to your grocery stores, when you can no longer get healthcare, and so many calamities that you abominable hairless human apes deserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You all deserve death and extinction. That&amp;#39;s the only redemption any of us will ever find, is our inevitable deaths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why not speed it up? I fucking hate the fact I was ever born to begin with. And don&amp;#39;t bother me with stoicism because I&amp;#39;m a broken emotional trainwreck all the fucking time, as much as I wished I was just an emotionless stonewall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I fucking hate everyone and everything. Nothing and no one is worth suffering for.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m ready to fucking die. I&amp;#39;m already dead inside, aside from growing rage without friends to keep me in check. You&amp;#39;ll all throw me under the bus when you can&amp;#39;t pretend to help me anymore. You&amp;#39;re all selfish, deceptive cunts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I will die next year, or you all will regret the monster you all drove me into becoming. I have no fucking empathy for anyone anymore with how much you bastards gaslights me and treat me like shit, and expect me to be calm and docile so you can manipulate me and backstab me even more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck you all. Fuck all humanity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t care what fucking damn well happens anymore or how much I hurt people anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m lonely because I&amp;#39;m an unsociable arse, and no matter all the therapy I&amp;#39;m going through right now, I can&amp;#39;t be rehabilitated. You all invalidate me and call me lazy anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pain has become a placebo in the absence of all pleasure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I only live to spite you all. But why even bother? It&amp;#39;s all fucking useless. Fuck all your mind games of dominance to justify all your fucking narcissism. All 8 billion of you human bastards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the fuck am I even writing and posting this shit? There is no real help.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as I explained above, I&amp;#39;m not fucking going to the psych ward EVER AGAIN. And I&amp;#39;ll know if you&amp;#39;re actually listening to me or not if you recommend I be hospitalized again. You never helped me but betrayed me to going back into the corrupt and abusive mental health system, just to make yourselves look like better people than you actually are.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;M FUCKING SAD AND ANGRY AND LONELY ALL THE TIME AND I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE. WHY IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING TO LET ME DIE INSTEAD OF KEEPING ME ALIVE TO FESTER IN MY OWN GANGRENOUS MIND.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Therapy isn&amp;#39;t helping me, it&amp;#39;s making me worse as usual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meds don&amp;#39;t numb me anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m 32 years old and i&amp;#39;m tired of life. I feel old and worn. I&amp;#39;m one of the fittest people you can ever meet and right now that counts for nothing. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mental health has been in decline for the past decade. I&amp;#39;m sure I suffer from bipolar or somewhere on the spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sorry for the few that I have and will let down eventually. I have a handsome and smart son and even that isn&amp;#39;t enough  to keep me in this world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hardly get to see him, spend time with him. I&amp;#39;m a horrible father, friend, son, brother, nephew. I&amp;#39;m a human being who has given up on life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I constantly self mutilate. Constantly searching for answers. I know I have inspired people to do good. I have done good in this life. That&amp;#39;s about the only solace I have in this miserable existense.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As my mental health declines so does my circle of friends, family and lovers. I don&amp;#39;t need this torment anymore. No one should go through this.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"This is about to be a super long wall of text, so here's a quick TLDR. **TLDR: I'm a burnt out university student and I feel like I can't take all this pressure anymore.**

I've been feeling terrible lately, even suicidal for the first time in awhile. I thought that maybe posting about my struggles anonymously to Reddit would make me feel a little bit better.

I'm 20 years old and a junior in college. I'm about to turn 21 in February and I just feel like there's nothing left for me. I've exhausted all options and I have no potential. My freshman year was awful and my grades dropped to a 2.1. I managed to tough it out and get a 3.05 last semester, but I honestly think I'm going to fail some classes this semester due to the fact that I've had chronic insomnia my whole life and it makes me sleep throughout the entire day most of the time. Thus, even though I've done all my homework and had good grades on exams, I still will fail based on attendance. I've emailed all my professors and they say they understand, but I know they can't do anything for me because that would be unfair to the other students they have (ie: the students who aren't fucking worthless wastes of space). I've tried everything I know how to do to manage my insomnia, but nothing helps. I feel like there's no point in carrying on if I can't even sleep like a normal fucking human being.

If my GPA drops again, I have no choice but to kill myself. My dad will cut me off financially and I won't have anyone to cosign my student loans anymore (in most cases you need to have someone to cosign). I won't be able to afford going to college anymore, not even a cheaper school, and without higher education I won't be able to make anything of myself. I feel like I'm destined to repeat the same unhappy lives that my parents and grandparents have led. My only purpose in life was to be an anchor baby for a toxic relationship, and that purpose has been served, so there's nothing else left for me to do in this life.

The fact that I can't sleep due to anxiety is only making my insomnia even worse. I should feel like I'm on top of the world right now-- I'm attending my dream school, I'm in the marching band, I just joined a sorority with lots of new friends who say they care about me and like hanging out with me, and I have a boyfriend, a roommate, a best friend, and two siblings who I consider my best friends and my only true family. I know they would be devastated if I was gone, but even that can't hold me back anymore. I stopped taking my medication and I bought a lot of OTC stuff to combine with the multiple bottles of meds that I still have. I've done my research and I'm pretty sure this would work.

The insurmountable pressure of knowing that I'm about to lose everything I've ever worked for is killing me inside. How is it that I'm so close to getting my degree, but I managed to fuck up again and now I'll never get it? It feels like my death certificate is all but signed. I can't even look in the mirror without crying. I try talking to my boyfriend about this stuff sometimes but even he doesn't know the whole truth of it because I don't want to make him worry about me-- the same goes for my roommate, best friend, and siblings. I can't tell my parents because my dad doesn't believe in depression and thinks that therapy is just a waste of time and money and my mom would just make me feel worse.

,SuicideWatch,"Let me start this out by saying that I'm not going to commit suicide. I have a daughter who is the same age that I was when my dad passed away and knowing how losing a parent was at least part of what fucked me up for life I absolutely cannot do that to her.

Right now my daughter is crying because the squirrel who comes and sits in the tree in our yard when she plays outside got run over by a car and she found him like that. They had been friends since the summer and she named him Stanley. She is inconsolable and I'm pretty broken up about it too tbh. I'm sorry if this sounds selfish or something but why did that need to happen to my daughter? Seeing her grieving just makes my already horrible mental state so much worse.

I'm not really doing her any favors by staying alive, since I'm literally just a sad sack who breaks down sobbing between 8-12 times a day, at home, in public, literally anywhere. But having the empty shell of me here seems to comfort her so I guess I have to stay, at least physically.

It's not going to get better. Even if the circumstances that make me feel this way change for the better, they can always change back again, plus I have zero coping mechanisms despite medications and intensive therapy. I'm super afraid that I will live a long life and not die until I'm old, and that thought fills me with dread. I can't take 50ish more years of suffering. I used to look forward to the future with hope, now that the man I love is gone all our plans have been ruined, my 20 year life plan is useless, I am useless now and a waste of space. When I hear about people who passed away I don't even think ""oh, that's so sad"", I just feel jealous because they got the one thing that I want so badly. I'm sorry because I know how insensitive that sounds but life is just like a bad dream that I can't wake up from. 

Yes I know it's trivial to be suicidal over a significant other, but I am, and I don't like it any more than anyone else does. Plus there are a whole host of other contributing factors but losing my boyfriend of 6 years and consequently all the stability and security of the life we had planned together was the straw that broke the camel's back.

Why are the answers to call a hotline or ""get help""? I'm arguing with myself here because I know the answer is that people just aren't equipped to deal with me, so they have to push you off on professionals that can handle it, but has anyone had a professional that's handled it? Anti-depressants, benzodiazepines, anti-psychotics... meds have made my life more difficult, especially benzodiazepines.

And if you're in the states, we're a country that's divided and cannot handle a pandemic. I think Trump was right about one thing, suicide rates will rise. The only thing is a lot of it is because of him. Letting people who were racist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. come out of their shells and speak freely. Hasn't anyone else lost empathy because of this? When I'm losing empathy for other human beings, I've already lost.

Like, how do people not understand that this shit makes me feel WORSE? I already know I don’t have it as bad as other people! That just makes me feel even shittier because I should be seizing the opportunities I have, but I don’t. Keeping myself from spiraling down even further is like a full time job, leaving me no time or motivation to do anything else. 

I don’t see how I can possibly move past this when I can’t even bring myself to have a basic daily self care routine. I feel like I’m working my ass off and moving literally nowhere. I’m 30 with no job, no money, no girlfriend (or friends in general), and no self esteem. 

I’m a fucking manchild who still has to be supported by his parents. I constantly see and feel the judgement of people when they start to piece together my life and realize I’m just a fucking loser. I was never as smart or capable as I thought, I was just really good at faking it. But now people can see that I’m really just a pathetic piece of shit and nobody wants to be around me anymore.

The one thing I had left was my looks and now that I’m going bald, that will fade away soon too. I’m so lucky to have parents who offer to help, but they’ve already spent so much on me that I just feel fucking pathetic making them do anything else for me. I can’t stand leaving the house now and I’ll put off simple tasks like getting groceries for weeks, rationing my food and sorta starving myself until it becomes unbearable and I work up the courage to go outside.

Everyone I get close to fucking leaves me and I’m sick of building up relationships just to be broken down over and over again. This shit is fucking dumb and I really don’t see the point in putting myself through all this suffering just to inevitably end up with a mediocre life. This wasn’t how shit was supposed to go down.

I just wish my parents weren’t around so I didn’t feel so bad about killing myself. They’ve already lost their only other kid, and I can’t put them through that pain again, especially when I have a choice. But I just don’t see how things will get better.

,SuicideWatch,"I made my plans a little while ago, as time goes on nothing is changing but the knowingness that it’s happening soon. I emailed my therapist yesterday and thanked her, and cancelled the rest of our appointments. Last month, I cut out most of my friends and family. I haven’t spoken to anyone but my employer, roommates, brother, and boyfriend in a month. But with them, I’ve been pretty open and honest about what I’m experiencing, so it won’t come as a surprise. 

I had thought about faking my death, as not to offend or hurt anyone else. I thought about going on a long hike, and killing myself far off trail in the woods so nobody can find me. My family would be distressed for a bit, but probably more at peace thinking it was an accident. But I’ve realized that actually... nobody is too phased by the concept. I’ve been posting on instagram and Snapchat that I am literally planning on killing myself soon and the response is very accepting, if not supportive of my decision. Some people will say “reach out if u need me!” but I can’t tell if they’re joking or not... you’re commenting that on a post where I wrote “please, anyone help me.” If they’re not joking... that’s so lazy that I’m almost offended? And if they are, well haha! 

I was considering sticking around so I didn’t make my little brother’s depression worse, but he expressed to me himself that he plans on committing suicide soon without regard to our family. I don’t think he needs me as much as I thought he did. I asked my mom if I can borrow her gun next week and she said yes, but I’ve been walking in and out of my closet all day messing with belts and ropes. At one point I slipped with a belt around my neck and thought “oh wouldn’t this just be rich” before my hanger rod snapped. 

I keep hoping I’ll tell the right person or say the right thing that can fix it all and make life the better option here, but there’s just nothing I can say. Nobody knows how to swallow something this big. I was molested and raped starting when I was a baby, and I have CPTSD now from repeated abuse, assault, and so much mental manipulation that I can’t even discern reality from feelings anymore. I don’t want to have panic attacks every time I wake up. I literally vomit every single morning because I’m so physically panicked when I come to reality. My reality- every aspect about my life- makes me panic. I don’t want to be here. I can’t work anymore. The government doesn’t think mental illness is real so assistance isn’t an option.

,SuicideWatch,"...it never gets any better.

My life started with misfortune and it only kept spiralling.
What little memory I have of *my*self, I grasp onto, I act out in my head, where it is safe, but it only makes the lack of feeling and enjoyment in the real world all the more noticeable.

My illness over three years brought pure misery upon me, stripping me from all I held dear, naked, pure.
Each day, suffering, uncertainty, how long will I make it? Why me? What have I done?

But one thing it gave me: Time with myself, a period of contemplation and alone conversation, pure isolation.
A monologue, starved off any emotions, any outer factors, just myself.


I used my last bit of energy and luck happened to be in my favour, I found a diagnosis, salvation, I thought.

Surgery, my body was opened, people carefully mending my vessel, disfiguring my once beautiful body as a byproduct, one of the few things I was happy enough with to not be pained by it, despite gender identity issues.
But if that was the price for my life, so shall it be, I was more than happy to pay it.

A magic mountain, high above it seemed like, beautiful, until I realized I was at the very bottom of it, having tumbled down to the foot of the giant I once tried to conquer.

Waves wash over me, all the emotions coming back, all the pain, now realized, fully processed, I feared this would happen, my sober, starved self foresaw this.

Yet I was there, weak, feeling worse during my recovery than I was, I felt ungrateful, horrible, why was I not happy?
So much laid ahead of me, but at the same time, nothing, my family urging me to get out, no connection with former friends.

I had experienced things nobody I knew had, as if I spoke a different language.
Yearning for love after a lifetime of abuse, was probably natural, my body and my soul hurt, I wanted a soothing warmth to comfort it, all those nights in pain, physical and psychological had left me starved, damaged, seeping the precious blood of confidence I had managed to accumulate prior to my downfall.

Online I met someone, the urge of my family, and the urge of decisions led to me fleeing my country, the negativity, the bad and good memories in an attempt to start over.

I was mistaken, immaturely I had acted and now pay the price for.
In this country, I do not feel at home, but nor do I in my home anymore, everything falls apart.

Who I love turns out to be different than I hoped, I love them, and yet, it hurts, my previous words of caution regarding sex had not worked, I was damaged, now even my sexuality in shards, cutting my brittle skin.

All words out of my mouth, falling into the void.

My identity, soul, sexuality, stripped, squeezed into a form, recycled into something more desireable.
Their words of comfort don't reach me anymore, I try to hear, I try to smile and ease their fears, their sadness, but I can't help but break and yearn for the touch of someone who doesn't hurt, who understands me.


Myself, the only person I can truly still love and trust, but can't be alone with anymore.

I don't want to be this facade and yet... I have lost my self.

Like an urge to rip my skin off, I can't be like this anymore, I want to get out of here, I feel ashamed, humiliated by everything, present, memory, the things to come.. every touch, every word, it shames me.

And yet I depend, unable to provide for myself in this land, in this state, wanting to love but struggling to.

&lt;p&gt;My life started with misfortune and it only kept spiralling.
What little memory I have of &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt;self, I grasp onto, I act out in my head, where it is safe, but it only makes the lack of feeling and enjoyment in the real world all the more noticeable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My illness over three years brought pure misery upon me, stripping me from all I held dear, naked, pure.
Each day, suffering, uncertainty, how long will I make it? Why me? What have I done?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But one thing it gave me: Time with myself, a period of contemplation and alone conversation, pure isolation.
A monologue, starved off any emotions, any outer factors, just myself.&lt;/p&gt;

,SuicideWatch,"So a bit of backstory, this took place over a Discord server at 3 in the morning. The people involved were me, the person who committed suicide in question, and her friend (whom I am also friends with)

So I was on the server talking to the mutual friend and generally having a very relaxed time when the person in question joins the call. The mutual friend tells me that our friend slit her wrists and is bleeding badly, so immediately my first aid training kicks in and I tell her to find something and apply pressure to stop the bleeding.

""no""

The friend and I beg and plead for an entire hour, I tell her she needs to stop the bleeding, that it wasn't worth it and that she needed to let someone know this was happening. We both told her she needed to tell her parents, but she refused on grounds that her relationship with her father was practically abusive. We continued trying, reasonng as desperately with her as we could, but no matter what we said, all she said was ""no"" and ""I'm done with this life guys"". I continued to desperately beg and reason with her, and as this was 3 in the morning and I was bloody exhausted, what I meant as ""don't do this, don't die on a Discord server..."" came out as ""Don't do this here..."" I immediately realised what a massive fuckup this was, as it sounded so bad, but it was too fucking late. She instantly leaves the call and me and her friend start panicking. We immediately start spamming her and calling her and telling her to come back. As this is happening, I submit a report onto Discord's trust and safety team with her user details.

She still hasn't responded and I'm assuming the worst right now. I'm just a kid (16M) and I wish I went to sleep earlier.

The people involved were me, the person who committed suicide in question, and her friend (whom I am also friends with)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I was on the server talking to the mutual friend and generally having a very relaxed time when the person in question joins the call. The mutual friend tells me that our friend slit her wrists and is bleeding badly, so immediately my first aid training kicks in and I tell her to find something and apply pressure to stop the bleeding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;no&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The friend and I beg and plead for an entire hour, I tell her she needs to stop the bleeding, that it wasn&amp;#39;t worth it and that she needed to let someone know this was happening. We both told her she needed to tell her parents, but she refused on grounds that her relationship with her father was practically abusive. We continued trying, reasonng as desperately with her as we could, but no matter what we said, all she said was &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m done with this life guys&amp;quot;. I continued to desperately beg and reason with her, and as this was 3 in the morning and I was bloody exhausted, what I meant as &amp;quot;don&amp;#39;t do this, don&amp;#39;t die on a Discord server...&amp;quot; came out as &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t do this here...&amp;quot; I immediately realised what a massive fuckup this was, as it sounded so bad, but it was too fucking late. She instantly leaves the call and me and her friend start panicking. We immediately start spamming her and calling her and telling her to come back. As this is happening, I submit a report onto Discord&amp;#39;s trust and safety team with her user details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She still hasn&amp;#39;t responded and I&amp;#39;m assuming the worst right now. I&amp;#39;m just a kid (16M) and I wish I went to sleep earlier. I don&amp;#39;t think there was anything else I could have possibly said and done but a part of me blames what I said out of pure exhaustion and I wonder if I could have said something else which could have saved her. I feel horrible and guilty right now and responsible for her death.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It just all feels so surreal...I wish there was more I could&amp;#39;ve done or said... but noone knew enough about her other than her country (no one knew her real name either)... it just feels so hopeless and I hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

Most people don’t give a fuck about your problems. They truly only care when you’re gone. Sure you can vent, but eventually the conversation will come to an end and they’ll likely forget everything you’ve said to them. They listen to feel better about themselves.

,SuicideWatch,"Firstly, I would like to apologise for those who have it so much worse. I hate coming out like this when I’m well aware in comparison to what could be, I’m not in that bad of a situation. But by heart and head can’t be stopped and this time I accept I am only human, so please, don’t see my cry for help the wrong way. 

I’m 27 years old and I don’t want to get into my sob story, but once again I’ve found myself to be so lost and alone. I can fill you in on a little of what’s happened.

I’m surrounded by people on social media but it doesn’t help me at all because I don’t ever actually see these people. I’ve lost of the heart of my life mate and my daughter moves away out of country again with the grasp of her mother. 

I sold my good life back in Scotland and moved to Germany to be a father to my 1 year old daughter after her mother and I split up in Scotland and then was cheated on for 2 years until I realised what was happening, from there I stayed in the country to be her father and eventually I found love again. A true deep love. 

But it’s been 2020 and it’s knocked the hell out of us and it’s finally destroyed us. Now what comes next in June/July will be my daughter being taken away by her mother to go live with the man her mother cheated on me with. 

Germany isn’t so bad but I struggle to speak the language and I got in a lot of trouble for punching someone who attacked me, they ruled it was self defence but the injury was so sever I was classed as a dangerous weapon and charged anyway, €4000 by the city and €13,000 by the mans compensation (a court case I wasn’t even allowed to go to and no lawyer would accept me because they “couldn’t speak english”.) so I’ve been left without money for quite some time and I have to deal with xenophobic people every single day because I’m a foreigner. 

It seems there will be nothing left for me here. But jobs in Scotland now are none existent so going back is almost a certain failure for my career and life. Most of my friends have all gone their own way and I don’t speak to really anyone at all. 

I’m an ex army veteran of five years and one tour of Afghanistan. That led to many attempts of suicide from 2014-2016, I managed to recover by the love of those around me I endured. 



All in all, I’m alone. I have nothing left to give and the ability to gain nothing. The love I have is unwanted or not good enough. People want my body on social media but no one actually wants me as a friend and companion. Each country I look at to start fresh looks like a failure waiting to happen. I’ll be replaced as a father and a lover. 

Now all I have is 4 walls to look at, with nothing but blank misery in my future. I went onto google and searched “what stops you being depressed” then “what stops you wanting to kill yourself”. All I get are hotlines, this doesn’t work for me. My doctors and psychiatrists during the army and afterwords left me wanting to kill myself even more.

Everyone. Therapist, my parents, etc. Today my abusive, narcissistic mother was like, ""Why don't you just get married and get out already? I want to have a smart grandchild i can raise to be like me instead of a failure like you."" 

I know I'm a failure. I couldn't even graduate high school despite wanting to. i couldn't achieve my dream of becoming a writer. i wish I was anyone but me. i hate myself. i want to take a knife and cut my face and wrists and my body because I'm a disugsitng person and I need the physical proof of it.

I'm tired of seeing the person who sexually molested me as a child and not being able to go anywhere because I'm unemployed, broke, codependent my mother, low self esteem, and stupid. stupid as fuck. I'm tired of this 

She said it in  a joking manner but it got to me.

There are a lot of other things. But I honestly cannot take this pain anymore. I am giving myself a week. If my new medication doesn't work, I will steal some of my molester grandpa's vodka and down my antidepressants and try to slit my throat. No one listens and no one cares. 

My stupid DBT therapist says its because I don't try the fucking skills enough. My life is shitty. I'm a toxic person. I am in an abusive relationship with myself.

,SuicideWatch,"I (F) have been battling mental illness since my teen years and I am almost 35. I think even as a child I was more sensitive than most. I always thought I’d die from this or self destructive behaviours. Yet I LIVED. With no family support I ever remember having. Rape and sexual assaults. Physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive friendships and relationships. Many personal losses, alcoholism, and a love of cocaine. I got my life together though. Seemingly. People think I’m a survivor and I’m open about mental health on IG but truly I’ve been planning on giving up. 

Yes I have no more addictions. Beautiful place of my own. SUV almost paid off. Work out 6 days a week and take care of my appearance meticulously. Great employee with a government job (albeit low paying and soul destroying I’ve smiled through it.) Outwardly I seem like I have it all together. I seem like a catch. It’s all just a mirage though. Smoke and mirrors. The cracks have begun to show at work and I’m no longer able to fake I’m ok. On my days off I don’t want to get out of bed and often times don’t. I started out anxiously puking up my food to deal with my mental health spinning out of control and now I just don’t eat at all. I seem friendly and kind on the surface but a confusing diagnosis between either being BPD or having CPTSD means I destroy all the healthy relationships I have. Especially romantic ones. 

I have no trust for others because I believe myself to be too much. I believe that I am inherently unlovable and considerably toxic. I test those I love who may love me but they get pushed to the point that they can’t anymore to protect their own peace. I’ve had so many bad relationships that have broken me that I now break down potentially good relationships because my mind tells me people are bad and out to hurt me. When I realize how good they are it’s too late and they are gone. I just did this and the person I’ve loved most, ever, just said it would be best if we never saw each other again. I begged but he’s right that my insecurity will always test us. No one has ever made me feel seen, and as accepted as him and I still pushed him to his limits. I don’t see any hope for my future. Not romantically. We are in this world where a lot of people are just looking to get laid or put on false pretences while they dishonestly date others behind your back. That’s all I experienced before him. I felt like just some hole to play with and it was really demoralizing. I felt like a shell of a person and I can’t go through that again. Please don’t tell me I should just work on myself. I’ve done a lot of work. I’m tired. I have one true friend that checks up on me but if her relationship was happier I’d probably have zero support. 

I want to say you really don’t know what demons inhabit someone’s mind. The constant shame of just existing can reside in anyone regardless of looks, status, or how their life may seem. Sometimes being grateful is just not enough when you feel alone. I appreciate any messages and I applaud those of you who selflessly take the time to offer support on here. It’s just that I want supportive people in my area and I want true love. I have decided my course of action within the next 24 hours. My home is staged like a Christmas open house. I have a cute outfit to be found in. I deleted and cleared out all my social media which went back to 2007. I am about to write my note and have a plan. I’m mostly at peace with this decision. I feel it’s time. I haven’t had any sign from the universe yet tonight that I shouldn’t go through with this but the only person that could probably talk some sense into me is my ex who will not be contacting. I feel bad that work will wonder where the heck I am on Monday and leaving them short staffed. No one really checks on me so I know it will be awhile before I’m found and I feel bad for the person who does. My only fear is of failing and ending up just messed up but still having to live.

,SuicideWatch,"On the outside, I look calm. But, I am literally battling every second to try to stop myself from having a panic attack and a mental breakdown. 

Everything I worked for was for nothing. Everything. I'm in medical school and I just bombed the most important exam that will determine the course of my career. I've been preparing for this exam non-stop for the past three months. I went into the exam feeling like I did my best. I finished the exam feeling pretty good. I was confident that I did ok. So, when I saw my score yesterday, I almost fell to the floor. I barely passed. Like literally just one point above failing. I needed a good score to keep my doors open. Now, I am screwed. I am absolutely screwed.

I put myself under so much pressure to prepare for this exam. I tried to make connections. I got involved in research and published important articles just to fet my name out. I pushed everyone around me away. I lost the love of my life because I was overbearing on her. All of this to end up with such a horrible score. 

I have a history of cutting myself and the urge to pick up the razor again has never been stronger. I can't sleep because my heart keeps pounding and I keep imagining myself hanging from the ceiling. It sure feels like a very attractive option right now, although I know I'm too much of a coward to actually pull the trigger on myself.

I just can't accept the fact that I'm a failure and deserve nothing good my way. 

I would like to consider myself a fairly religious person. I prayed regularly and believed in pre-destination. I always thought that I just had to do my best and be a good person, and somehow things will work out for me eventually. Well, I'm starting to feel like a fool for ever believing in that. For the first time in a while, I stopped praying. The only praying I'm doing right now is for God to take my soul and let me rest in peace. 

Everything I did has been for nothing. I have no fight left in me. I just can't reason myself out of this. This was my last chance and I blew it. It's all over. I lost everything.

&lt;p&gt;Everything I worked for was for nothing. Everything. I&amp;#39;m in medical school and I just bombed the most important exam that will determine the course of my career. I&amp;#39;ve been preparing for this exam non-stop for the past three months. I went into the exam feeling like I did my best. I finished the exam feeling pretty good. I was confident that I did ok. So, when I saw my score yesterday, I almost fell to the floor. I barely passed. Like literally just one point above failing. I needed a good score to keep my doors open. Now, I am screwed. I am absolutely screwed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I put myself under so much pressure to prepare for this exam. I tried to make connections. I got involved in research and published important articles just to fet my name out. I pushed everyone around me away. I lost the love of my life because I was overbearing on her. All of this to end up with such a horrible score. &lt;/p&gt;

I used to have constant nightmares. all of them upset me or make me anxious in various ways but a few nights ago I cried after waking up from a happy dream.

in this dream I made up with a friend who I fell out with a while ago and we went on vacation to a place where I always wanted to go. I was with my two favorite people i've ever felt close to and loved by and we got to explore my dream vacation place.

I had no responsibilities and no money problems, just me and my two favorites living in the moment laughing, running around, and around, and having tons of fun.

I woke up and it fucked me up immensely thinking I could never make that a reality. i'll never be that happy or have that because i'm inherently disgusting and stupid and gross and no one wants to be around me and they shouldn't have to put up with me because I wouldn't

When I got home I got beat, pretty much told that I am an idiot and the insurance doesn’t cover most of the fees so I got in trouble for that. I understand, I know it was expensive but if she just left me there she would only have to pay for a funeral! I know that’s wrong to say but I’m just really upset right now! The fact that I got in trouble for trying to kill myself and do is both a favor and she does something that only makes me want to kill my self again!!!&lt;/p&gt;

She seems to be happy most of the time. When I tell her that I am having a hard time, suicidal thoughts, or stressed out she turns against me. Last night she came into our place and caught me on the suicide hotline.

She went to the kitchen and complained about my cooking. I asked her to talk about the phone call and she went to the bedroom and locked the door. I was sitting on the couch in an emotional teeter totter. Deserve to kill myself, or will the pain I inflict on my family be too much?

We have a rule where we don't talk to others about personal matters unless we explicity say that we want to. It's a little relationship quirk, but it's very important to me. I started to get concerned calls from a lot of contacts. It was very embarrassing to say the least.

The trust violation has really hurt me. Today we went for an outing that she was really looking forward to. I felt hurt about the past and sort of afraid because she has been violent and has lied publicly about me to diminish my character in the past. I lost my dream job because she falsely accused me of constraining her to an isolated location. She wasn't even working and I paid for her vehicle, mma training sessions, and all other expenses.

She had her MMA friends beat the shit out me. It was a terrible, dehumanizing experience. That was our initial break up.

A few months later she calls me because she is pregnant with our son. I decide to man up, swallow my recently bruised pride, and take care of her and my future child. That requires me to end my employment and move to a state that I hate.

Tragically our son dies. I may have not loved the circumstances that brought my son into my life but I loved my son. I will forever be scarred by the memories of giving him CPR when I knew that he was dead.

Hi. Sorry if this is a bit long but I am DESPERATE

So I have a long track history with mental health issues. I am also physically disabled. I didn’t explicitly tell anyone this when I moved in, but I use a walking stick.

I moved into a shared house last month. I was very careful where I moved and chose an estate that felt safe; living with two girls of a similar age with lots common so thought it would be a good match. 

A week into it things started to go wrong. The eldest, G, has a way of communicating very different from mine. She was nagging at me and using a lot of passive-aggressive language when talking. I felt like she was talking down to me, and found myself getting angry because I'm a grown-ass adult and know how to take bins out etc.

We had friction about a sofa, which made things tense because I wanted the sofa and she didn't because she already has her 'special' armchair. She didn’t understand why I need a sofa close to the TV (spoiler: my boyfriend is partially sighted, and my vision isn't great either. I told her this.)

When lockdown hit we talked about not seeing our boyfriends, as everyone lives in shared houses. The youngest, M, said she wanted to still see hers and told me to do the same. I said no and she left. We haven't really spoken since but I know she has been seeing him and has also been to Wales. 

I’ve been trying to make peace by baking, and up social ideas, so we can all get to know each other. When I suggested a movie night, M said she did not want to hang with us and took her things from the shared space.

I've been struggling since sofa-gate, plus I'd already been falling behind at work and taking sick days. I knew I couldn't keep this up. My paranoia was awful at this point, being convinced someone’s tampering with my food and being scared someone is watching/following me. I didn’t tell them because I didn’t know/trust them.

Saturday I accidentally opened a package of M's thinking it was mine and text her to say so. 

Sunday our landlord came to visit, and I was to clean my things in the living room beforehand. I overslept and woke up in a panic. I went downstairs with a massive apology to both G and the landlord but M was not home. 

After this, I fell asleep. I woke to texts from G nagging and from M about the mail. M lost it with me, I apologised and offered a replacement. She said I was crossing a line and it was a complete lack of respect. She also berated me for not cleaning my belongings for the landlord.

I then texted G asking if she was angry at me for not cleaning; she was.

After many texts, I decided it was the final straw. My thoughts were impossible to silence and I called 111.

Fast forward and I am staying at my boyfriend's. I got a text from G about a missing Tupperware. She later sent a photo of it in the bin saying ""I hope this picture helps everybody to remember"". This led to me telling them what happened and that receiving massive angry texts is a trigger for me. If we have something to say, we call a house meeting.

G said that I should have told them before I moved in that I've mental health issues because she has a family with similar issues and she “didn’t sign up for this”. M chimed in and agreed.

I said to stop texting me and they could call me if they needed me. They kept texting me, and the next day asked about my plans. I told them I don't owe them that. They then contacted the landlord.
