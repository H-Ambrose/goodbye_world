###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",t2_1t70,False,,1,False,"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it",[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_doqwow,False,dark,1.0,,public,2322,42,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2322,,True,,False,,[],"{'gid_1': 1, 'gid_2': 1}",,True,,1572389522.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,True,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say &amp;quot;PM me anytime&amp;quot; in a casual social context.  &lt;/p&gt;

I‘m heartbroken and it wasn‘t even someone I actually truly dated. It was just one date and then he played with my feelings and time. He was someone though I did like on and off and he pretended to be interested in me more than once over the years. Idk what set him off but this year he asked me out and then ghosted me again.


My university is killing me, my anxiety is making me crazy and my self hatred and depression make me want to die so bad.


I feel so ugly and unloveable. I feel like I‘m just good for people to dump their emotions on me just so they can forget other better people. And once they have the time to get back to them, they‘ll leave me.


I try to tell myself that I‘m getting better but I‘m not. No one takes me seriously. I‘m so depressed, I didn‘t want to be treated this way.


All people I liked never loved me, even my exes. They just used me to get over someone. I thought I‘d recognize that pattern but I fell for it again. The only difference is that I (!) put a stop to it and said I don‘t want to be treated this way.


But why do people, especially guys, assume they can treat me like a doormat. I try to stay away and the rare times I do open up, this shit happens.


I feel so worthless because of it, like I‘m supposed to never be loved. Which would be ok if I didn‘t connect it to me having to be so fucking disgustingly ugly and terrible. I‘m tired, I want to sleep and not wake up.

,depression,"Hi there and good day to everyone reading this.

Essentially the title.

Just a bit of background so you can get some context on the situation. I am currently a sophomore taking a Computer Science major (which I feel would help me the best in accomplishing my dream to become an indie game developer). 

I started college 2 years ago (2018) after my parents had forced me to go to college directly after Highschool even though I wanted to take a year break before I did, just to prepare my mind and just to do stuff that I was/am interested in (Website design, game dev, piano playing and drawing). 

To make matters worse they actually picked a major for me to do (Electrical engineering) which I did not enjoy at all (the damn course had physics, one of my most disliked subjects ever). I did fail my first year as a result and then switched to a computer science Major (to be done in the 2019 academic year). This went MUCH better than the first year and then finally managed to make it into my sophomore year. ""The future is looking bright right?"" I thought to myself. 

Fast forward to this year and things start to turn south once again. With the pandemic going on it really made life a bit difficult. Normally I'm used to studying in a disciplined environment, but at home it was basically impossible, due to chores that needed to be done, renovation plans and dogs constantly barking in our neighborhood. Also for some reason, I just lost motivation to study when I thought about people who are dying and losing their lives, jobs and only way to survive . I failed a course last semester (statistics) and failed another stats course (got 49 which was agonizingly close, just 1% more to  pass) this semester. Also provided that I don't get at least 50 for an upcoming Computer Science (A CS course from this semester as well) retest, I basically fail my major and will more than likely have to repeat.

My college however, in these difficult times, has announced that there will be no academic exclusions (nobody will be kicked out even if they fail).

I'm just a bit saddened that it's come to this. My parents are probably going to kill me if they find out and I really don't know what to do. They are the type to berate and compare you to other great top achievers and other guys who are smart etc.

I really love the idea of creating video games (starting to learn unity now), playing video games as well (as a matter of fact got some money saved up to build one before black Friday ends this year) and creating websites (I'm making one right now for myself), and sometimes I wonder that if I can't pass Computer Science is that dream/thought just a joke?

,depression,"I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

,depression,"I was a really happy guy until this year, one awful thing keeps happening right after another

The first thing that really messed me up, was my ex who was with me for 3 years, left me for someone else she met. This MESSED me up because I loved her more than anything else in the world. To say I was depressed and insane would be an understatement. It doesn't help that I checked her social media (i know you should never do that) but I saw she is still with that guy, they have a house together and shes pregnant. 

Since she broke up with me, I couldn't afford to live on my own so i had to move back in with my mom. A month after i moved back in with my mom, she found out she has cancer all over her body. Shes been on chemo this whole time, but the cancer is still slowly spreading and the thought of losing her rips me apart. She probably doesn't have too much time left. This has been hard on everyone in my family. 

Yet another problem. I have been applying to jobs for months so I can get my own apartment and try to restart my life. I can't get a job to hire me that will pay enough to get me a 1 bedroom apartment no matter how hard I try. I'm so desperate for a decent job.

To add onto all of that. I dont have 1 single friend. The only people that ive gotten text from since March is family. 

Everything is falling apart and i can't fix any of it. I cant dig myself out of this hole no matter how hard i try. Ive been giving it my all for months. I really really want to give up and end myself. NOTHING is working out for me. I thought that the idea of suicide would go away by now, but it's staying. I hate my life.

Last week I ran out of medication and wasn't able to pick up my refills for a few days which I thought was no big deal. Nothing's gonna happen.

&lt;p&gt;Am I just going to believe I&amp;#39;m not good enough for a job or friends or my own home or for a relationship or marriage or having a family later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I just going to keep having to use meds to stop my brain going into a total meltdown for everyday life?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I going to keep making myself small and invisible in all conversations to not humiliate myself or make other people uncomfortable?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Am I going to constantly spend all my energy just hating every aspect of my body, my mind, myself. Am I going to keep rejecting any kindness or gratitude giving onto me?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is it and this is how I&amp;#39;m spending my time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this really all there is for me?&lt;/p&gt;

My gf tells me to wake her up if I get like this again, but honestly I hate to bother her for any of this shit just bc she has enough to worry about. I guess I'm just realizing how overwhelmed I am. I tend to bury it pretty deep so I can help my gf, parents and sister with their shit, but this feeling just keeps coming up at the oddest of times. Pretty sure my parents are gonna divorce one of these days, and my sister wont interact with any of us if she's high which is literally all the time. My gf freaks out over me a lot bc she never knows when I'm gonna fall apart, and the anticipation kills her inside. I just got my life together why does it feel like literally everything around me is falling apart?

It's been over a year since I officially cut ties with my suicidal bipolar ex, and the feelings I got back then should be gone, but they aren't. I still have dreams of her. Memories of her screaming at me to give up on her still haunt me. The crippling futility I felt back then never left. I don't think it ever will.

I don't know what I'm typing anymore. Every time I try to better my life I freeze up and give up on everything. I want to be so much more than I am. I can't get back on Vyvanse bc the 10 years I was taking it as a kid have already fucked me up enough. I always end up doing the exact opposite of what I want to do. I just want to do shit with my life instead of wasting all of my time eating like shit and hiding all my feelings from the people who are trying to bring me up so I can do literally nothing.

,depression,"I know when all of these started, I was 15, I got the chance to go to my dream Uni in the country, but my family just suffered from a recent death, and my Mom did let my study in the Uni that I wanted to go. I blamed my Mom and myself for not speaking up early and maybe I still had the chance to catch up. But I did. I lost all motivation to study. 

I FELT LOST THEN. I FELT EVERYONE ARE BETTER THAN ME. I FELT LIKE I'M THE WORTHLESS GUY. 

I kept telling my parents that I wasn't happy with the course I was taking. But my parents told me to just study as it would be just a waste of time and money to shift courses but the never listened. 

Somehow I finished the course. I wasn't happy on my graduation day. I FELT I COULD'VE DONE BETTER. My Mom and Dad were happy. But I wasn't. I got the degree, but I didn't learn anything. 

My parents wanted me to go straight to Med school. But I held myself and said that I want to take gap year (wait a year or two). 

I took up night work instead of a day job, so that I can been far from the stress of daily life. 

Two years have passed, and in those 2 years I worked hard and didn't spent a penny on myself and opened a small business just to help myself and the family with the tuition. And just in case something happens to me. I know I had my family sorted out. But I am still not well. I want to end everything. I want it to stop. I cry at night. I'm lost.

Now I am in Med school. To follow the Dream that I want to be a doctor. But I have no motivation. I don't study at all. I can't focus. I feel like everytime I have to study, I will fail. I have no self confidence. I feel like I'm a failure. I just lay on the bed with no feeling but the thought of ending it.

,depression,"Hey guys,

Bit worried / unsure about this and wanted to reach out and ask if this was symptomatic of depression.

Recently, I’ve started questioning and wondering what the point of any of this is (life).

I don’t have any unwanted or obtrusive thoughts. It’s more of a dull feeling.

As a kid, I wanted to do something ‘important’ or ‘amazing’ with my life. Picked up a guitar at 15 and set my eyes on becoming a musician. Also, had dreams of becoming an actor when I was younger. Got a BA in Drama, but out of uni neither was I well-equipped or in the know at all about the industry and soon lost faith in that. (Something universities and educational institutes better damn start looking into).

Grew up, got a regular job. And now life just feels as though it’s on mute, living paycheck to paycheck, and I’ve given up on my dreams. Music and film are my biggest passions and I enjoy playing guitar and singing. I also pick apart films and TV with regard to cinematography, acting, plot and the rest of it. Not just a casual viewer.

But I think now that a career in the arts is massively self-indulgent and I almost tell myself that it’s also stupid and a pipe dream now. The market itself is saturated and sometimes when I listen to music now I do just end up thinking ‘well I’ve heard this before, why are you any different? What makes you so special that I should listen to your take on heartbreak?’ 

My partner of 2 years and I recently broke up too. I have no interest in dating and, yeah, life just feels a bit meh.

Is it a matter of goal-setting to get myself out of this slump, am I being too cynical about the arts, etc.?",t2_6jhym4n8,False,,0,False,Is this normal?,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,True,t3_jyw0hd,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606082183.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey guys,&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So I have been on short term disability and leave of absence from my job since October 12th due to a psychotic break.  A complete mental breakdown.

I have suffered from depression,  anxiety and drug use since I was a teen.  I'm in my early 50's now.  But this was the first real time I've actually committed to treatment..  I wasn't able to get into the program for 2 weeks after my leave began due to there not being an opening.  When I finally did start it was of course all virtual.  The book I received was a bunch of copied pages in a generic white binder.  Not even page numbers.  I got a lot of ""Cheer up.  Look a things from a different perspective.  Say ""I get to do this"" instead of ""I have to do this"".  And i also got a lot of medication thrown at me.  But no solid, real help.  Also came to the realization that my drinking and drug use had a lot to do with causing my mental health issues, not the other way around.  But I came to that realization on my own, not through anything they helped me with.

When I suggested that I may need drug and alcohol treatment as well it was like they closed me off.  They agreed I needed the treatment but that I did not need to extend my LOA.

Now my job is one of the main reasons I had my break to begin with.  And I am nowhere near ready to go back.  Everytime I even think about it my emotions go haywire, I can't eat, can't sleep.  Hate the thought.  I used to love my job (customer service for a large insurance company internationally known) but over time this particular job can literally grind you down.  With the right treatment and help I may get that joy back.  But the hospital refuses to sign off on it.  They say I  need structure.  But how is throwing me back Into a situation that helped cause my break to begin with help me, especially when I know I am not mentally or emotionally ready?  I feel like no one there is even listening to me.  I am getting a second opinion from another place, but I am worried that the other hospital will tell them that I don't need the extension and they will force me to go back.  

  Now obviously my job is not the only issue, but at this point it was a major factor in my recent issues.  My immediate supervisor understands and agrees with me, as do my co workers and friends, but the original hospital doesn't care and won't listen.  Now I am feeling like I am being forced to go back and I will quit first.  But if I quit I will lose my insurance and won't be able to get treatment at all.  I feel backed into corner with the hospital saying I should just deal with it but my mind telling me if I go back it will not end well.  Like with suicide.  Or worse.

I've (F18) been depressed for a long time now. Had a shitty childhood and went through bullying since ages 12-17. I never had many friends because people didn't liked me but I was cool with that because I had my 3 best friends. All changed tho, 3 months ago they all left me. 1 of them for no reason she just stop replying to my texts (the other two didnt want to hang around me anymore )and it hurts because I shared my feelings with these people,they shared theirs too and they just left . Now I'm here sitting on my bed all day crying because I feel so lonely. Seeing all these people talking about how awesome their friends are and seeing them going out makes me even more depressed.I wish I had friends and I wish someone would want to be my friend :( I don't have anyone to talk and I feel such a loser because the only person I can talk to without feeling that I'm bothering them is myself. Yes I talk to myself. Its embarrassing. I also have a real low self esteem. I always believed that I was fat/ugly/annoying and I still believe ,that this is the reason noone wants to be my friend. I can't keep living that. I'm so tired of feeling useless,ugly,pathetic. All the kids I know (from my school,neighbourhood etc) are all going in college. And then there's me that can't even find a job to pay to go to the college I want. I'm a failure. I'm sick of feeling like that all these years. I want to k*ll myself but the only reason I haven't done this yet is because I dont have the guts to tell my bf (he's the best person on earth and the reason why I started changing and becoming a better person + he's the reason I stop taking drugs) that I don't wanna live  anymore. I can't let him down but I also cant live with myself. I hate me. I hate me so much. I secretly wish someone would k*ll me with their car.

Love comes stumbling down like an ambush dialogue with dead words, if you don&amp;#39;t live miserable... no one is waiting for you to arrive at night. Success comes very little, because you will eat with it and sleep. Maybe with dignity, maybe, yes, but that is not life, that is not dreams, you want to live and it is difficult. She says: People are eating everywhere, why are you leaving? But if you are lucky, very little, you will not pay attention to all this, you will not see behind you and will find that time has dragged its coat under your feet. You will not say with astonishment when you open your mouth: a year has passed, then two, three, four and twenty years have passed. You have been robbed, so all you have to do is pull the coffin lid over you. Events do not happen in other countries, discussions do not come, or maybe if you are lucky. Of course, a little whisper will reach you from afar. You will find that life has preceded you in another place, but here it has remained standing, forever, you yearn for the other, and you are unable to overcome it.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I don't want to go into the details to much but. When I was a kid I pretty much learned not to trust and open up to people because you'll end up getting hurt by them.

Cut forward to my early 20's. I get a boyfriend and I slowly allow my self to open up and trust him. He's the first person I've opened up too since I was a little kid. He ends up treating me badly and sexually assaulting me multiple times.

After that I shut down again, learning that opening up isn't worth it.

Well I end up getting a new friend. I begin to trust her and eventually I open up. I allow my self to be vulnerable with her. And it turned out great. She was hugely supportive and helped me a lot. She became my best friend and I her's. 

I helped her a lot when she was at her lowest and she did the same for me. Until recently. Slowly she started pushing me away. She wouldn't talk with me and just seemed to want nothing to do with me.

Eventually I learn the truth. She thinks that she's a bad influence on me and that she's actually hurting me. So she decided to push me away to protect me.

The thing is she isn't a bad influence. I've made some poor choices but those choices were my own. She never pushed me towards anything and actively tryed to protect me. 

But now she's decided I'm better off without her and it hurts, a lot. She was the only one that I fully trusted. She's the only one I could fully open up too. And now she's gone. In trying to protect me all she did was hurt me. All she's done is reinforce what I learned as a kid. If I allow people in I'll just get hurt.

,depression,"Hey Everyone!!! 

First of all, I'm very much new to Reddit (!) and hope it's alright to ask if you all can be gentle with me if that's possible, please. 

I would also like to give my thanks for the existance of this subreddit; Thank you and I really appreciate the fact that people like us can share our stories and hopefully feel better and even better if there's a chance to read others thoughts &amp; opinions on my situation! that would be so awesome and helpful. I am very grateful even for the oppurtunity to just let this out - I think there's some healing in just letting it out. I just REALLY need to be heard and seen right now :(

I really, really feel the need to share this and get it off my chest as it's been weighing heavy on me for a long time now (I feel). Long story short, I'm a student studying at University at what I would call my dream B.A field. I'm 28 and have been at Uni for 4 YEARS now (!!!!). Where I'm from, literally everyone on MOST B.A programs (depends on your major tbh - as in most of them are literally 3 year programs) - finish them in 3 years tops. In my specific field, it is also 3 years (at my Uni it can be done within 3.5 years at BEST probably). So, already I feel so over it tbh. And, by my calculations I STILL have another 2.5 years to go...you can imagine how daunting that makes a person feel that's already suffering from Depression. Basically, doing a B.A for 6.5 YEARSSSSS.

Here's my problem - my issue is, I really suffer with (a lack of) motivation and it's to the point that I find it hard to function well aka take care of myself properly. I find it that much harder with school...and it dawned on me very recently that I just HATE studying. When I mean hate, I mean it with an absolute passion. This isn't a ""ugh, studying is boring"" this is more like "" I HATE studying; I am so bored, so unmotivated and hate it with the very core of my being"". I realize all of this must sound so stupid like wtf are you doing in school, in Uni if you hate studying?? believe me, I hate myself for feeling this way. I really, really do. I am not proud of it. This was something that...literally dawned on me and it took me this long to admit it to myself. I am absolutely ashamed to feel this way...I see other students peers in my major and they are some of the smartest people I've seen at my school; every single course - just amazing students. Straight 90+ (grade) students. That KNOW their shit. My school friends are in the same major as me and they're brilliant and ace every. single. course - no buts and or if's about it. Obviously, I cannot help but feel so incredibly jealous. And again, ashamed. 

Like, I'm studying my dream major - why am I doing this to myself?  I feel like I'm literally ruinning my life. Deep down in my heart? I KNOW I could have done way better from the very, very start. It kills me that I cannot get to the point of accessing my own potentional in my studies. And believe me I am not talking about shitting out 100's in every course! All I want is to do my BEST and hopefully get as high as I can. But even that I seem to not be able to do. 

I think what really breaks my heart is I know I am myself to blame. All I have is myself to blame. This isn't a situation where I am out partying every night and ""omg I'm having fun I didn't get to my studies haha!"", this isn't even a situation where I'm in a loving relationship that's consuming my life and ""I find it hard to balance that AND school""...it's not even ANY of these !!! It's literally me just fucking all this up. Having NO motivation at all to study. Like I said, I realize I have no one else to blame; not the professors, not the courses, nothing but myself at the end of the day.

I wish there was a perfect way to describe this feeling of ""no motivation"" in regards to studying - I just seriously hate it. I hate studying and I find it sooo boring and cannot concentrate at all. It is a miracle I have even gotten to 4+ years in Uni at this point. I just feel so over it. The whole Uni thing just depresses me greatly and gives me sucidal thoughts as it is - I was in talk Therapy for 2+ years and it was very much because of this (among other things of course). Now, being over a year and some change out of therapy - I realize that things haven't changed in this regard. 

I want to be very clear - I am the last person on earth that doesn't believe in hard work. I know that there is not way I could ever make something of myself in my field (or any other for that matter) if I do not study. I know there is no ""shortcuts"". I know that all my friends and student peers study and they study HARD. I just, sadly...**don't have it in me** and it breaks my little heart and I beat myself up for it all the time. The hard thing is I DON'T KNOW where ""to get"" motivation. This has literally been such a struggle for me actively for literally OVER 4 YEARS now. It's almost to the point of an existential crises - the only analogy I have is like knowing when you're thirsty - you just drink water in order to quench your thirst. But here, I DON'T KNOW what to gather and or do in order to ""quench"" my lack of complete motivation. 

There is also a part of me that feels like ""what's the point?"" with my lower grades, there's no chance of getting into grad school which is already sadly VERY highly competitive so that also is hindering my abilites to gather any and all motivation. I always sit down and these thoughts always arise, especially now that I'm doing this awfully difficult course - ""what's the point of this shit? I hate my current courses, they aren't for the most part going to get any better at all and I HATE studying...another 2.5 years of this...literally just, HOW?"". 

I promise you I am not ungrateful about school and the oppurtinity to even be in higher education.

Because of my depression  &amp; sucidal thoughts of which I have been suffering from on and off the past 7 years straight - I have found that I have lost the desire to date, lost the desire for relationships, lost the desire for children, lost the desire for friends &amp; having a social life and I found that all that was ""left"" so to speak, was school which I already hate - BUT what was really left was my dream carrer that I had been dreaming about since I was 16. Now, it feels like even that isn't left because of everything that I shared. It just breaks my heart - like my soul's little heart on a whole other existential level. I wanted this dream carrer more than a Husband. More than kids. It is and has always been everything to me...yet now I cannot even study and even hate it.

**I am SO LOST. I have literally no idea what to do.**

I feel like no one gets it. No one even respects that fact that I have depression - when I share, I am met with things like ""I don't know what to tell you"" and or ""I don't believe you"" by my own family. They're also ashamed of me. When I was in Therapy they wouldn't even dare say so to my own brother much less extended family. When I shared with my friends at FIRST they were supportive but then they made fun of me and judged me heavily for it. It really sucks. 

Please let me know what you think - I'd love to hear your thoughts!

That said I haven’t been depressed in past. Just really really stressed. I have a massive mortgage, non functioning wife due to incredibly severe mental illness and job has been on line for while.

For context, my sadness and depressive thoughts  mainly come from being extremly overwhelmed with school, thinking about my relationship with my family, thinking about my childhood and just being overall frustrated with myself.

I have those big mood swings. One day I can be feeling motivated to exercise, study and work for a great future. But the next day I would lay in bed for 6h straight, crying, feeling discouraged and thinking about death.

It can also happen but in the same day, for example I  would feel okay the whole day but then I cry myself to sleep. I'm so frustrated that I  can't stay consistent with my mood and I can't consistently work on my goals.

I wouldn't say I have suicidal thoughts, but I constantly question what the point of living is.

My parents and sister and other people do not have a clue what I am going through. I just have no idea where to start. I've never talked about it with anyone because everytime I have in the past, I just get told things like ""just get outside"" or ""just force yourself to get out of bed, what is so hard about that?"". Stuff like that and totally shrugging it off. The stigma towards depression is a serious problem. I do have my yearly physical with my doctor coming up. Is that where I should start?

She used to blame me in front of that people, punish me or humiliate me for the smallest mistakes. In one case when she noticed about an assault she beat me in front of my gramma, (the rapist had left sooner) I hid in a room, locked the door and cried for hours. I could hear her talk on my back very loudly toward her mom. Things like I was disgusting and I was stupid and naive and etc. I was 7 at the time. That one rapist of me was around 20. The rest where more or less the same age. My first rapist was 21 and I was 5. My parents both used to blame and humiliate me in front of others. I was always really scared and embarrassed when one of them was around. Everyone in family gatherings and among my friends and school class mates and even teachers knew how I felt when they were around. Like that wasn’t enough, when I turned 18 my older sister started dating with my first rapist (she knew what had happened to me) and bragged about it at home all the time.

""I should be fine. There's nothing to worry about"" but to me nothing will ever go fine. I hadn't been attending school for a while now because the truth is, i'm dumb and i'm tired. Tired of everything, tired of me. All of the shits are building up on my head and every single one of my thoughts lead into me realizing how weak and pathetic I am. I'm pathetic. A loser. 

I want to make my mom proud but thinking of this just reminds me of her ignoring the achievements I try to show her saying that she won't earn money from it and the way she never attended any of my awarding ceremonies with all of the students' parents around except for mine.. I know, I'm overdramatic but that's me. I want to love too but I'm always blocked by the reality I had seen throughout my life. I want to wear dresses too but my insecurity eats me from the inside, making me realize how bad I look from my head down to my toes. 

The nightmares of that shit october 2008, I have witnessed my dad rape my sister, threaten about killing us, the way he sliced me with a small blade for being a loud 5-year-old, mom doing all ways to kill him to protect us and the days in courtroom are making me sink once again. Back then, it just hurt parts of me, not letting me breathe but now it's just empty. Hollow, nothingness thats unbearably heavy to the point that I can't leave my bed. I know I should move on and that those happened more than a decade ago but I cant. I may have forgiven dad but I can't forget everything especially when mom reminds me of them every fucking day leading me to feel like everything is my fault. Only if I hadn't existed. 

I'm all fucked up, once again. I wish to die but anxious of the things to occur if I do die. Will you still consider me your friend? Will you forget about me after days?

So i’ve been so irritated today.. Like, more than usual
I (24F) feel like it’s not only the time we’re in - I just switched to what is a better job, on paper, but it’s suuuch a jump from what I know and it’s intimidating, despite my manager being a very forgiving person. I wanna move out as well but I can’t (financial and familial reasons) and I have had bad anxiety since I went back to working my last job before the switch along with what feels like very low self-esteem. I know I’m getting bad again too very eerily as I’m breaking down again..

My friends are busy doing their own things, and I watch from the sidelines.
I have people who care for me and I know it but I feel I ache for someone to care, romantically in a sea of ones who want one-nighters here and there.
I feel I can’t talk to my therapist bc she sounds irritated on the phone last time we talked and don’t want to try - she’s great but I also had ADD and feel that’s where most of my issues lie, especially with exec. dysfunction, and she doesn’t specialize in any of it.

I also wish I could lose weight..

I'll start with the disclaimer: I am not suicidal or in any danger of hurting myself or others. The ""help"" in the title is in regard to my general current situation described below. I have a phone call with my doctor scheduled, I just want to hear from the community.

Been on fluoxetine for 2 years. Felt ok when I started, not 100% happy, but certainly a difference in mood.

Throughout the last 2 years, although not suicidal or ""depressed,"" I gradually found myself losing all interest in hobbies. I didn't hate my life, I just didn't care.

In response I then went up to 60mg earlier this year and still nothing. No interest in books, music, games, movies, working on my car, even going out with friends. All things I was able to do while early on in my treatment.

Went up to 80mg a month ago. No enjoyment in anything. No willpower or drive to go to work, no aspirations or goals, drowning in debt and ignoring the letters/calls/emails for late payments. Just completely checked out, indifferent to everything, absolute lack of caring about my well-being. I physically cannot find the whatever to sit down and play a video game, read a book, put on a record. Most days I can barely get myself up to feed myself.

I still follow my prescription. 80mg fluoxetine, 40mg generic adderall in morning. 20-40mg generic adderall at noon. 50mg naltrexone before bed. 10mg alprazolam as needed for anxiety but I'm so completely apathetic these days that even anxiety isn't an issue because I never leave the house so I rarely touch that.

I am an alcoholic, hence the naltrexone. I've cut back my drinking significantly as I know it affects the fluoxetine. During a relapse night is the only time I feel the drive to play a game or music which is of course dangerous not only because of the medication but also of my brain associating hobbies with alcohol that I cannot enjoy sober any more.

I have a phone call scheduled with my doctor's office. I see the nurse (APN I think is her title). She is the only person I've spoken with in the psychiatrist office.

I guess I'm looking for guidance on what to discuss with her. As well as any experience of yours with switching to another medication if you've experienced what I have. Or any advice or honestly anything in general because I feel more lost than when I began treatment 2 years ago.

&lt;p&gt;In response I then went up to 60mg earlier this year and still nothing. No interest in books, music, games, movies, working on my car, even going out with friends. All things I was able to do while early on in my treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Went up to 80mg a month ago. No enjoyment in anything. No willpower or drive to go to work, no aspirations or goals, drowning in debt and ignoring the letters/calls/emails for late payments. Just completely checked out, indifferent to everything, absolute lack of caring about my well-being. I physically cannot find the whatever to sit down and play a video game, read a book, put on a record. Most days I can barely get myself up to feed myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still follow my prescription. 80mg fluoxetine, 40mg generic adderall in morning. 20-40mg generic adderall at noon. 50mg naltrexone before bed. 10mg alprazolam as needed for anxiety but I&amp;#39;m so completely apathetic these days that even anxiety isn&amp;#39;t an issue because I never leave the house so I rarely touch that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am an alcoholic, hence the naltrexone. I&amp;#39;ve cut back my drinking significantly as I know it affects the fluoxetine. During a relapse night is the only time I feel the drive to play a game or music which is of course dangerous not only because of the medication but also of my brain associating hobbies with alcohol that I cannot enjoy sober any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a phone call scheduled with my doctor&amp;#39;s office. I see the nurse (APN I think is her title). She is the only person I&amp;#39;ve spoken with in the psychiatrist office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I guess I&amp;#39;m looking for guidance on what to discuss with her. As well as any experience of yours with switching to another medication if you&amp;#39;ve experienced what I have. Or any advice or honestly anything in general because I feel more lost than when I began treatment 2 years ago. I feel like I&amp;#39;ve dug my hole so deep in regard to debt and employment that idk how I&amp;#39;ll climb out.&lt;/p&gt;

This year has been a year full of changes for me, I could say that for the better, however, lately I have had depressive episodes.
When I was a little girl I never had friends, I was raped, and I even suffered from bullying. I always had the need to start over, so I asked my parents to change my school. In fourth grade, it was the third or fourth time I changed schools, but this time it was different because I was able to make friends. I did not realize until years later, six to be precise, that they only made me feel bad, thanks to them my self-esteem declined every day, and no matter how much I told them not to bother with my body, they continued. I never made things clear with them, because after all they were my friends, and I thought that was what friends did. But like I said, after those six years, I was able to change schools again, for my last two years of school. of my ""friends"" only two of them came back to look for me, nowadays they are like my older brothers, I kept in touch with two friends (Girls) with whom I had never met before, and I also started going to therapy for social anxiety. When I changed schools I met my best friend, who has also helped me a lot. And that's how we got to this year.
I was able to enter the university I wanted to the career I wanted, at the beginning of the year I met a boy through my other two friends (the Girls), and I was able to begin to improve my relationship with my parents. Two months later, before the pandemic started, I realized that my relationship with those other two friends (the Girls again) was also toxic, however I wanted to give them more opportunities than they deserved because I didn't want to lose their friendship. but in the end it all ended badly. after that, I was able to establish the things with my boyfriend on my birthday. He makes me want to be better every time, so since I met him I began to be more aware of myself, to do things better and better, and to work on everything that made me feel bad.
However, as much as I want to do things right, I always fail, I am not good at anything, I am not intelligent, I have no plans for the future, I try hard in college and I always fail, I am not even pretty. I do not have nothing in particular, and no matter how hard I try, I will never have it.
and today, I really wanted to do things right, but failed again. I had tried so hard to do a job for college. and I can assure that I get the lowest grade of all my classmates. I start to have more frequent depressive episodes. I think I'm starting to tire my boyfriend. And I just wanna take bleach and die, But I don't want my parents, or my friends, or my boyfriend to feel bad.

&amp;#x200B;

Never had any close friend that i could really tell how i feel, like sure; i had 2 friends in primary school, then one in middle school ^(&lt;That bullied me in first class, mentally and physcically&gt;) and now one in high school but i still have to act like someone that im definitely not and mostly by that people look at me as i would be borderline boorish.

&amp;#x200B;

For like month i had some faith in myself after i helped one girl to not get hurt. She was thankful to me, talked with me and hugged me every time she saw me but after like month or even one and a half she just stopped giving fuck about me. I don't even think about something more because i dont find myself as even someone who would be attractive at any point, but hey, it was just friendship and i never did something bad, rude or behaved like dick, just talked as i do with other friends. But okay, after that i just wanted to deal with loneliness literally any fucking way, no matter how and at what cost, so i got myself to get some hooker, just to feel some even fake love, i don't care at this point and  i was quite disappointed when even sex didnt felt good, i felt that im missing the whole point of it, after all of it we talked for a while because we had some time left, honestly it didnt really helped out so for last 2 months i just keept chatting with people on polish chat roulettes but after all i found 2 really nice girls that i spoke to for few days, but one of them stopped giving fuck about me, not starting conversation and took few hours to answer, and second one just got  bored of me but whenever i wanted to do something together she refused.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried talking with school psychologist but he was just listening, like during hour he said 4-5 words max from himself that wasnt ""oh, okay"" ""continue"" ""don't stress"" so i just stopped going in here before second lockdown for schools

&amp;#x200B;

What can i say about myself? The first of all im fat as fuck, but im on good way, im slowly but constantly losing weight by beginning of August (just 6 kg's but i can't push myself to lose it faster), most of days i can't even push myself to do something more than attend in classes, lie in bed and play some games,i cant even find any new hobby for myself, during my whole life i tried dozens of them like programming, reading manga (&amp; watching anime), playing chess (im trash, just 850 mmr), modeling 3d drawing, playing guitar, capoeira but the biggest my problem is the fact that im hardly anxious that i will be rejected again as i did all times in past.

People you love are strangers, they are foreign to you. 
And you ask your self who am i? 
Things you enjoy become tedious, and pointless. 
Are you a person still?
Empty, the emptiness becomes deafening. 
Pieces, every broken seam seeps regret.
Pretending your whole, trying to get through. 
Your breaking apart, a water main collapsing under concrete. 
Suddenly the world beyond your eye lids is a monster.

You'll be okay, everyone has told you so. 
You know it will pass but damn does it last.

Its like bashing my head against a wall trying to break through. I have all Fs and my mother, someone i trusted only exists as a constant reminded on how much of an acidemic failure i am and how i should stop doing anything and get to work. Im just done with school and i no longer care if i flunk because no matter what i do or how much i study it all goes to hell.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hi, I don't feel comfortable using my real name so I'll go by Andy. 

I just need an outlet. I've never felt comfortable talking about how I feel as I don't want anyone to think I have it worse off then the next guy. I know everyone has issues and everyone deserves inherent respect and support for such.

I have never been officially diagnosed with depression, I will not claim I have as such out of respect for those who do. 

So with all that out of the way..
I hit my lowest point recently. A few months ago, alot of things happened all at once and really did a number on me. I just had a car accident where both my passenger side tires were bent which was going to cost almost $1000. I was working 2 jobs and one of those was very toxic because of some of the people I worked with. Along with this I just started my first semester of college. I know all of that seems very tame to some of you. This is not why I'm writing this, its only some of the recent events that added up.

In 2014, my grandfather died, I wasn't very close to him but being my mothers father it affected her greatly. She soon feel into alcoholism and has been an alcoholic since then. I was 14, I am now 21. When I was younger I resented my mother because of the things she would do and the way she would treat my father, he wasn't a saint either but I didn't understand at the time that my mother was sick. I moved in with my grandparents about mid way through high school because of my parents constant arguing and my mothers alcoholism. I still feel guilty about leaving but I couldn't take it. 

Fast forward to 2018, my parents took me out to eat and told me they were moving to Colorado and wanted to take me with them. I agreed and moved, leaving my best friend. At first it was well and good, mom seemed to drink less, and the fighting stopped. 3 months later it was worse that ever, my mom would scream at my father, barge in my room at 3 am saying that he was abusive. This with a mixture of missing my friends, I had to move again.

Now its 2020. My parents live in Iowa and I'm back home. Recently my parents visited and my mom was drunk and sobbed about how much she missed me. Now I miss my parents dearly and I'd just like things to get better but my mother will not seek help. They claim they are doing better but that have a tendency for lying. I call my mom every once and a while but I feel that our relationship may be a little too strained at this point. I no longer resent my mom and I miss her alot but I don't know how to start mending this, she did alot of things that really hurt me but like I said, I miss them alot. 

I'm sorry about the length and the formatting, this is my first post.

And to those who are struggling out there, I truly hope you find the help that you deserve.

,depression,"I’m sorry if this is unnecessarily long. 

My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together 9 months and are currently long distance. About a month ago he informed me his mental health was getting bad and wants to go back to therapy before it gets worse. He was in therapy for 2 years before we even met. He said it helped a lot and he’s mental health improved dramatically. Well his mental health is definitely getting worse, but he hasn’t gone back to therapy. I ask him every couple of days if he’s found/looked for a therapist. He hasn’t and I don’t know if I should keep asking. 

It’s also only been a month, but our relationship is already taking a toll. We barely text/FT compared to before. I understand it’s hard for people with depression to do normal day to day things and maintain relationships. So, I’ve been giving him his space and only really reach out to send him cute animated “I care about you” theme’d images. I also always make sure to reassure him and tell him how much I love/care for him and how I’ll always be there for him.

It’s been really bad this past week. He’s so angry at the world, he calls himself stupid and crazy, and talks about how much he hates life and people. He’s also been getting triggered by a lot of things, so the dynamic of our conversations have completely changed. He’s definitely not himself right now. I don’t know what to do, what to say or how to respond. I’ve read that I should not offer advice and just “be there for them.” I’m so frustrated and stressed, I don’t know how to respond to this. I want to be able to help. 

Today he called me angrily ranting about life. I didn’t know how to respond and was mostly quiet. That pissed him off and told me he’s not expecting me to cure him, but he expects me to talk him through this. But I genuinely don’t know how to respond or I’m scared to trigger him/upset him even more. I feel like I’m doing a really bad job at being supportive/comforting and it’s even harder since it’s long distance.

I also always make sure to reassure him and tell him how much I love/care for him and how I’ll always be there for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been really bad this past week. He’s so angry at the world, he calls himself stupid and crazy, and talks about how much he hates life and people. He’s also been getting triggered by a lot of things, so the dynamic of our conversations have completely changed. He’s definitely not himself right now. I don’t know what to do, what to say or how to respond. I’ve read that I should not offer advice and just “be there for them.” I’m so frustrated and stressed, I don’t know how to respond to this. I want to be able to help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today he called me angrily ranting about life. I didn’t know how to respond and was mostly quiet. That pissed him off and told me he’s not expecting me to cure him, but he expects me to talk him through this. But I genuinely don’t know how to respond or I’m scared to trigger him/upset him even more. I feel like I’m doing a really bad job at being supportive/comforting and it’s even harder since it’s long distance. I’ve been reading up on how to be supportive while your SO is depressed, but a lot of it sounds repetitive. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Does anyone have any helpful tips on how to respond/talk to/comfort him?&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’m 99% sure I’ve been depressed since I was like 10 or 11. I remember crying constantly about how much I wanted to die (still do of course). I never told anyone though because a big part of it was that I feel super guilty for feeling like this, and also that I don’t deserve help because I’m a piece of shit.

My moms reaction was to call me manipulative whenever I cried about minor stuff, rather than thinking that something deeper was going on. Which I guess is my fault but still. I actually developed an eating disorder when I was 12-13, mostly because of this, and had to go to therapy and shit. I was too embarrassed to tell the actual reason (bc it was bullshit family therapy crap and I did not need my parents to know that stuff) so I just yelled a lot about how I’m ugly and want to be skinni.

Now my little sister is 10 and in therapy because she has severe misophonia and sensory issues, and apparently she’s super depressed as well. My mom was like, oh, be nice to her, she acts kind of crazy but she’s really depressed, try to help her.

And I have been, of course, she’s my little sister and it’s upsetting that she’s going to have to deal with the shit I’ve been dealing with for like 4 years (I’m 15 now).

But it’s just upsetting that there was zero sympathy for me when I got crazy mood swings and was crying at the drop of a hat and starving myself. Just ugh, you’re so crazy. Stop it.

I started (s/h tw) &gt;!cutting myself recently, although I’ve been scratching and pinching myself for a long time. I’ve been just doing surface level stuff with a pair of tweezers, bc I don’t have a razor lol. I tried to get the blade out of my razor but it didn’t work haha.!&lt;

I am so close to killing myself. I’m smart, get good grades, but I don’t have many friends because I’ve been isolating myself intentionally for 4 years 😎. I have a (mostly) loving family, and a great future ahead of me. I just don’t fucking want it. I still feel like I don’t deserve it. I mean, we always say there are so few good people in the world. Some people are objectively bad, and I’m pretty much positive I’m one of them.

Idek what to do anymore. I had a plan to kill myself on my 15th birthday two weeks ago but I couldn’t because I didn’t want to make my grandparents sad. But any day now my self hatred is going to outweigh that and I’m going to stop caring. I almost went to sleep in a hot car on purpose (like 2 months ago) but my dad found me. I was so upset that I wasn’t dead but I had to play it off like, oh I wasn’t asleep, haha.

I’m in therapy too, because I got into college and my mom made me go to 9th grade instead, so we’ve been fighting a lot about that. So now we’re in dumbass family therapy because she thinks I’m crazy for not wanting to repeat classes, and thinks that I’m far too immature to go to college. The therapist literally agrees with me but my mom won’t budge lol. 

Idk how to tell my therapist that I think I’m depressed, especially since I vehemently denied it when he suggested it a few weeks ago. Idek if he’s be able to help me because all the stuff I’m depressed about is based in truth. Is it worth it to tell him and try to get help? How do I do that.

It just pisses me off. 

So I'm basically living this misery for over 10 years and I'd probably had started having bad thoughts by now if not for video games, which are real savior for me and good way to escape from everyday shit.

Video games really are saving me from falling down into deep depression - as while I'm playing I feel happy, I feel like not everything is shit in life and waiting for upcoming releases gives something to look for and anticipate - which is sorta a motor for moving forward.. It's not a motivation in life per se, but it's at least something to look forward to. 

I mostly enjoy RPG, action adventure and FPS games with immersive worlds and great narratives. I also absolutely love souls games - as fighting against all odds makes me feel like I'm overcoming at least some challenges (sadly not ones irl) but still having to challenge myself and overcome it despite unfavorable odds feels uplifting.

,depression,"❌❌❌SORRY FOR THE LONG POST❌❌❌

Before starting I want to make clear that, even though I really not enjoy being alive lately (“lately” about like 5 years lol) I’m not actively attempting to kill my self, I’m just asking myself questions accordingly to my wiews on suicide.

I really can’t understand why am i still living.
My life slowly started to take a bad turn a long time ago, nothing serious happening, everything just started to get darker and darker way before I could have noticed, you know like the Boiling frog fable, my world started to feel more and more empty almost like everything around me was vanishing. I remember the day when i was struck by this epiphany, I don’t remember being in a particularly bad mood but I remember it was a Saturday because after school I was going back home with my sister. I stop the car in front of the house and i can’t get out, i can’t because I realise that I have no purpose and that it doesn’t really matter whether i stay in the car or get in and have lunch or if i would be suddenly transported a million kilometres away from there or if i die in that exact moment. So I stay in there and I start crying as the thought of my existential loneliness stars to form more and more clearly in my mind, I feel like i can’t breathe, like I’m drowning, like I’m being dragged down in the depths of the ocean and all the pressure of the water is crushing me and no one can hear my scream, i feel cold; and i picture this image of me sliding, towards the end of my live, down a perfectly smooth surface that keeps getting steeper as i try to hold on something but there isn’t anything to hang on. That was just the first of many cases of what we can call a panic attack (i guess?) 

Since then I started to reflect on the concept of suicide and it’s implications and I’ve came up with the ideas that I have today on suicide. First of all, i didn’t bothered to ask myself about the afterlife because that’s something I simply couldn’t solve so I worked with what I had from the perspective of the alives, and I didn’t found anything that can really be a good reason to not committing suicide.
What I say may sound selfish but i really couldn’t find anything which argues in favor of staying alive that isn’t some dumb concern about making someone sad or disappointed. I mean, how could that possibly matters if I’m dead? Actually, how can the grief of the people for me (assuming that someone besides my closest relatives would give to me 1 second long thought after I’m dead) can exist? How anything can exist anymore after that? Why me (a dead man) should worry about something that matters only to the world of the living? Why consequences that I won’t be there to take should influence my decision? Here’s the thing about suicide, you literally can’t go wrong with it. What will define that your act was wrong or good? Suicide is a pretty neutral act. 
Now you could say “what if things gets better in the future?” And I would say why should i bet on that? Why should i keep waiting to see if things gets better? You could say that i have nothing to loose but that’s not entirely true, I would still have to deal with pain everyday as i go on and things can always get worse in the meantime. The real thing is that waiting is not enough and of course I should do something to put me on the path to make my life better, but, assuming that i find this path, is walking that path worth it? Why should I push myself through all the struggle? Why should I put me in the position of failing to follow that path? Even if i end up being somewhat successful on following that path, why should i waste all the rest of my life putting together the pieces of something shattered beyond repair a long time ago? And most important, why should i have to put up whit all this only to become a sighting worse version of me after all the potential I had have been wasted in this unrewarding endeavour? I don’t want to live only to become the “less worse that i could get” version of myself.
When you choose to become a deadman nothing matters anymore and there isn’t anything more liberating for man than that.


The only two things that keep me from follow up with my theory are:
1. as everyone I’m scared of actually ending my life, not because I fear the afterlife as i said but because I’m scared of being unsuccessful and just causing me a lot of pain, or worse, condemning me to live crippled.
2. According to my thoughts the only rational thing to do for anyone as soon as they can realise this is to killing themselves and I find it a bit extreme. like, suggesting to everyone from old people to anyone old enough to understand this in middle school to suicide causing the extinction of humanity lmao.",t2_8ua0cab9,False,,0,False,🎶Tell me why...🎶,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jyr0nl,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606055040.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;❌❌❌SORRY FOR THE LONG POST❌❌❌&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"This problem began ever since I learned the techniques of burping from my cousin, I was 12 years old: it was the winter of 2017. During that time I attended a boarding school with a middle school education that lasted from September 2016 until 2019.

It was a very tough time for me, I was taunted and bullied almost every week, I was the dump truck for the popularity of others, and it only increased my anxiety which made me belch even more air. The schedule was absurd, every day I only had 20 minutes at most to finish my meal, and no more food was served after that, because they didn't care to bother: the parents aren't around to accuse. I often went hungry, so I would pile as much food as I can and finished eating it before the next activity. But it had impacted negative side effects on my esophageal well-being. To sum it up, don't go to a boarding school when you're 11 years old.

In the summer of 2019, I was lucky enough to be remove from one hell of a playground, and moved 550km away, where I attend my first high-school, the home environment (not the school, and never the school) assisted me to emotionally relieve myself, but in turn it spiked up my swallowing problems, which was already there to hug me unconditionally.

wOndEr hOw it WenT? On a beautiful sunny day of the October in 2019, exactly half a year after I left that damn school, I regurgitated my food during a tasty cereal breakfast on a freshly fixed lawn; the milk temperature wasn't how my stomach wanted.

Unfortunate events began crumbling after, a month later, I couldn't swallow as properly (not saying that swallowing didn't hurt a year ago) and every bite was like a trip to the ER after breaking your legs from the third floor, nothing helped nor relieved my pain: Medicine (it made the situation worse because of the hard tablets), therapy, special ""fluid"" diets, etc, nope. It gradually went from eating a proper thanksgiving meal with a die-hearted chicken broth in the heaven of 2015, to something that had to be carefully prepared and scheduled or I will die on a hospital bed, nevertheless, those options never benefited me in any way.

I've had a GI done while I was back in China, but they couldn't find anything and weren't convinced that I needed to get a Barium Swallow done. I had ""mysterious"" stomach aches whenever the food lingered in-between my esophagus, and more often than not I would find myself waking up in the middle of the night having to blow my nose with mucus full of what I had ate for dinner. Sometimes I couldn't breathe whenever I had food stuck, and etc, etc. The list goes on for so long I don't even recollect most of them.

For months, we visited doctors, and somehow none of them recognized that I had Dysphagia. Eventually, we found one, because the symptoms were becoming prominent, and so my father applied the treatment from the Medi-Cal insurance, and we waited. Fast forward to 2020, a year after, the insurance was still pending, as if praying that I would eventually forget about this and leave it alone. Spoilers, we didn't. We called them, and they told us to wait, but we already did. We still haven't found the resolution and I've visited the ER a couple times already.

There isn't anything special about this essay that I'm doing, I'm writing this because I'm desperate, I really want a solution, I feel suicidal sometimes because of this.

&lt;p&gt;wOndEr hOw it WenT? On a beautiful sunny day of the October in 2019, exactly half a year after I left that damn school, I regurgitated my food during a tasty cereal breakfast on a freshly fixed lawn; the milk temperature wasn&amp;#39;t how my stomach wanted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunate events began crumbling after, a month later, I couldn&amp;#39;t swallow as properly (not saying that swallowing didn&amp;#39;t hurt a year ago) and every bite was like a trip to the ER after breaking your legs from the third floor, nothing helped nor relieved my pain: Medicine (it made the situation worse because of the hard tablets), therapy, special &amp;quot;fluid&amp;quot; diets, etc, nope. It gradually went from eating a proper thanksgiving meal with a die-hearted chicken broth in the heaven of 2015, to something that had to be carefully prepared and scheduled or I will die on a hospital bed, nevertheless, those options never benefited me in any way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve had a GI done while I was back in China, but they couldn&amp;#39;t find anything and weren&amp;#39;t convinced that I needed to get a Barium Swallow done. I had &amp;quot;mysterious&amp;quot; stomach aches whenever the food lingered in-between my esophagus, and more often than not I would find myself waking up in the middle of the night having to blow my nose with mucus full of what I had ate for dinner. Sometimes I couldn&amp;#39;t breathe whenever I had food stuck, and etc, etc. The list goes on for so long I don&amp;#39;t even recollect most of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For months, we visited doctors, and somehow none of them recognized that I had Dysphagia. Eventually, we found one, because the symptoms were becoming prominent, and so my father applied the treatment from the Medi-Cal insurance, and we waited. Fast forward to 2020, a year after, the insurance was still pending, as if praying that I would eventually forget about this and leave it alone. Spoilers, we didn&amp;#39;t. We called them, and they told us to wait, but we already did. We still haven&amp;#39;t found the resolution and I&amp;#39;ve visited the ER a couple times already.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There isn&amp;#39;t anything special about this essay that I&amp;#39;m doing, I&amp;#39;m writing this because I&amp;#39;m desperate, I really want a solution, I feel suicidal sometimes because of this. The pain is unbearable; a needle poke felt like a gentle pat on head compared to my swallowing issues. Please, I want it to stop :(&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"From a young age I had huge respect for military service men. I'd go to airshows as a kid and there'd be men from all branches of the military dotted around watching with everybody else. From the age of 15 I wanted to be a royal marine commando (i also wanted to be a bodybuilder). I started going to the gym at 15 and was well on my way to achieving both those things at 18 In terms of my body/physique and fitness. But i had issues with my stomach and bowels. Still do. Have been to the doctors a few times over the years and had tests done that found nothing. The other issue is im sure i have adhd. Which i have tried to overlook because I couldn't be  a commando with adhd, no way. So the beginning of this week i decided to go on a diet of only eating non processed foods, meat, rice, fruit, nuts. Tht kinda stuff. My insides have been the worst they have been for months. But it alternates between constipation and diarrhoea. My insides dont hurt but theres a constant discomfort where i literally have constant anxiety because my bowel movements are so unpredictable and i have never been able to establish whats food causes any of this.

Anyway, at 18 i was forced to go to uni, where things basically just got worse for me. I got a 2:1 Law degree. Which is good i guess. But thts the only good thing that came from uni. Im now 22 and been in limbo the last year. Trying to decide whether to get help with the adhd and stomach issues or join the military. It could only be 1 or the other. 

I can never relax. Nothing relaxes me and that probably doesnt help my stomach. But today I was relaxed. I woke up and had the shits. I was meeting a friend to explore some old mines so i had to fix it. So i had half a bottle of codeine linctus. I emptied my bowels as much as possible before i drank the codeine. And it sorted me for the day. But also got me high (ive done it before numerous times) and i had such a great day. I was relaxed all day and felt no discomfort in my stomach and bowels which was probably down to the painkilling properties of codeine. But i was so relaxed and felt genuinely happy for the first time in ages. Because i was comfortable basically. 

I finally decided i have to put my health first. And it sucks i cant be a marine commando but its not my fault, just bad luck and bad genetics (digestive problems run in the family sadly, thats how most of em die 🙂 ) maybe i can still be a body builder though.

,depression,"I'm(f) 28 years old and got diagnosed with severe depression past September. This will be very long and I'm sorry if it comes off like a mess. I'm not in a very good state of mind at the moment as it's all still fresh. Also English is not my first language and I'm on mobile. So please bear with me. 


I come from a culture where children stay with their parents until marriage so I've been living with my parents and siblings (m25, f15). My parents came to this country as immigrants but my siblings and I were born and raised here. 


I've been seeing a therapist since September and I feel very conformable and really like talking to her. I've told her how my parents are negative and worried about me seeing a therapist, especially one with a different cultural background. They think my therapist will brainwash me to turn my back to my culture. So my therapist suggested a few times to invite them to a session so she can explain to them what our sessions are about and what I'm going through. I was hesitant at first because I know my parents and their view against therapists. But eventually I gave in and invited my parents to yesterdays session. My mother was willing, but I had to practically drag my father to come with us. 


The session was a sh*tshow. They have this idea I talk badly of them to my therapist and doctor, while I not once said a bad thing about them. They (mostly my father) dragged me through the dirt in front of my therapist. They painted this image like they gave me everything a child growing up could dream of and I'm being ungrateful and selfish. I was crying the whole session and could barely talk while my father was saying how I only thought of myself and they let me free and let me make my own choices. 


Which is bullsh*t. I've always lived the life my parents wanted for me. My whole life I was pushed by my father to be the best at school and to be a good example for other kids of our culture. He put that responsibility on me and every time I failed to meet his expectations I would get punished, verbally and physically. I would get told I was an embarrassment and a dumbass. Whenever we would visit his side of the family all they would talk about were our (brother and me) failures at school and life. We never heard anything about my cousins school lifes. All they talked about was us. He constantly embarrassed us in front of his family and if we ever said anything we would get reprimanded for it. I got sick of family members giving us 'advice' on how to do better. I never asked for anyone's opinion but still they felt entitled to give us their piece of mind. They were always (and still are) involved in everything that's going on in our lives. 


I felt so much pressure growing up I developed failure anxiety. I've always wanted to study medicine and become a doctor but failed to get through the entrance exam. My second choice was studying Psychology, but that wasn't good enough for my father. So I chose something I never thought about before, I went to study Pharmaceutical Sciences, to make him happy. I didn't like it and tolerated it for 2 years. After that I told my father I wanted to study Psychology and he got mad at me for wasting 2 years and scolded me for not telling him before that I wanted to study Psychology. Which I did. I did tell him I wanted to study Psychology from the start but he denied it. My mother and brother even backed me up but he still didn't accept it. 


I then went to study Psychology but my anxiety affected me a lot. On top of that I got sexually assaulted by an ex. He almost raped me but luckily I managed to get away. Nobody knows about this except 2 of my close friends. All of this made me lose my whole focus and I failed most of my classes that year. 


I had enough of studying at that point. I was mentally exhausted and my self confidence was very low. I changed to another field and after 4 difficult years and a lot of struggles I managed to get a bachelor's degree in Pedagogy. 


I've never had the feeling my father was proud of me. He keeps saying I destroyed his dreams and hopes for me. He wanted a daughter he could boast with. A daughter who's a doctor. Someone high educated and who people can look up to. He constantly brings up how he had dreams for me and I failed him. He mockingly calls me a doctor, a pharmacist and a psycholog. 


I had dreams too. I truly wanted to study medicine and become a doctor. But he can't let it go. I can't even tell him he's the reason I failed at life because he never accepts responsibility for our wrongdoings. 


I've been feeling bad for years but I've always suppressed those feelings. But as times went on it got worse. This past year I've had a lot of comments by my colleagues that I looked bad and tired. I could barely sleep and I had days I had to force myself to continue working. I wanted to cry all the time. I had to hold all of that in just so I could keep working. 


I finally got my breaking point past September after I got a bad migraine that lasted a week. I went to the doctor and the moment he asked me if everything was okay tears started falling down my cheeks. I've been holding in so much baggage throughout the years it started to affect me physically. 


I've thought a lot about death and how badly I wanted to be gone. The only thing keeping me alive was suicide being a big sin in my religion. I didn't want to mess up my after life because of my messed up life here. 


I don't even know where I'm going with writing all this. Maybe I just needed to get this off my chest. Or maybe I just wanted to hear from others with similar experiences. 


I've been living the life my parents wanted for me for so long that I don't even know who I am. I don't know what kind of person I am. All I know is that I'm tired. 


I feel like I messed up everyone's lives around me by having depression. I feel like a burden. I feel unwanted. My parents see my depression as an attack on their parenthood. They can't understand why I'm depressed. I have everything a person could want, why am I not happy? 


I keep getting the same questions and I'm tired of hearing them. 


I'm tired of being blamed for my depression. 


I'm tired of being treated like crap by people close to me. 


I'm tired of feeling like a burden to everyone around me.

I was crying the whole session and could barely talk while my father was saying how I only thought of myself and they let me free and let me make my own choices. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which is bullsh*t. I&amp;#39;ve always lived the life my parents wanted for me. My whole life I was pushed by my father to be the best at school and to be a good example for other kids of our culture. He put that responsibility on me and every time I failed to meet his expectations I would get punished, verbally and physically. I would get told I was an embarrassment and a dumbass. Whenever we would visit his side of the family all they would talk about were our (brother and me) failures at school and life. We never heard anything about my cousins school lifes. All they talked about was us. He constantly embarrassed us in front of his family and if we ever said anything we would get reprimanded for it. I got sick of family members giving us &amp;#39;advice&amp;#39; on how to do better. I never asked for anyone&amp;#39;s opinion but still they felt entitled to give us their piece of mind. They were always (and still are) involved in everything that&amp;#39;s going on in our lives. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I felt so much pressure growing up I developed failure anxiety. I&amp;#39;ve always wanted to study medicine and become a doctor but failed to get through the entrance exam. My second choice was studying Psychology, but that wasn&amp;#39;t good enough for my father. So I chose something I never thought about before, I went to study Pharmaceutical Sciences, to make him happy. I didn&amp;#39;t like it and tolerated it for 2 years. After that I told my father I wanted to study Psychology and he got mad at me for wasting 2 years and scolded me for not telling him before that I wanted to study Psychology. Which I did. I did tell him I wanted to study Psychology from the start but he denied it. My mother and brother even backed me up but he still didn&amp;#39;t accept it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I then went to study Psychology but my anxiety affected me a lot. On top of that I got sexually assaulted by an ex. He almost raped me but luckily I managed to get away. Nobody knows about this except 2 of my close friends. All of this made me lose my whole focus and I failed most of my classes that year. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had enough of studying at that point. I was mentally exhausted and my self confidence was very low. I changed to another field and after 4 difficult years and a lot of struggles I managed to get a bachelor&amp;#39;s degree in Pedagogy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never had the feeling my father was proud of me. He keeps saying I destroyed his dreams and hopes for me. He wanted a daughter he could boast with. A daughter who&amp;#39;s a doctor. Someone high educated and who people can look up to. He constantly brings up how he had dreams for me and I failed him. He mockingly calls me a doctor, a pharmacist and a psycholog. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had dreams too. I truly wanted to study medicine and become a doctor. But he can&amp;#39;t let it go. I can&amp;#39;t even tell him he&amp;#39;s the reason I failed at life because he never accepts responsibility for our wrongdoings. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been feeling bad for years but I&amp;#39;ve always suppressed those feelings. But as times went on it got worse. This past year I&amp;#39;ve had a lot of comments by my colleagues that I looked bad and tired. I could barely sleep and I had days I had to force myself to continue working. I wanted to cry all the time. I had to hold all of that in just so I could keep working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I finally got my breaking point past September after I got a bad migraine that lasted a week. I went to the doctor and the moment he asked me if everything was okay tears started falling down my cheeks. I&amp;#39;ve been holding in so much baggage throughout the years it started to affect me physically. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve thought a lot about death and how badly I wanted to be gone. The only thing keeping me alive was suicide being a big sin in my religion. I didn&amp;#39;t want to mess up my after life because of my messed up life here. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#39;t even know where I&amp;#39;m going with writing all this. Maybe I just needed to get this off my chest. Or maybe I just wanted to hear from others with similar experiences. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been living the life my parents wanted for me for so long that I don&amp;#39;t even know who I am. I don&amp;#39;t know what kind of person I am. All I know is that I&amp;#39;m tired. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I feel like I messed up everyone&amp;#39;s lives around me by having depression. I feel like a burden. I feel unwanted. My parents see my depression as an attack on their parenthood. They can&amp;#39;t understand why I&amp;#39;m depressed. I have everything a person could want, why am I not happy? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep getting the same questions and I&amp;#39;m tired of hearing them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of being blamed for my depression. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of being treated like crap by people close to me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m tired of feeling like a burden to everyone around me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so tired.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I graduated college in the spring and started my first real job which is remote because of the pandemic. I didn't even feel proud about graduating and getting a job, maybe relieved but other than that nothing. The job is boring and I know I'm a lazy employee. I moved out of my parents' house in september to live in a new city with a friend. But she spends almost all her time when she's not working with her girlfriend so I'm alone most of the time. I know a couple other people in the area well enough to get a meal occasionally but they would think I'm weird if I asked them to hang out too much. I'm physically unwell. I don't know exactly what is wrong but something is. I'm weak and tired, constant headaches, my heart races and I feel lightheaded or out of breath just going to take a shower or something. I pick at my scalp constantly and am slowly losing my hair from it. I wake up disoriented every morning and can't get myself out of bed when I should. And I fall asleep during work even when I try to fight it, the sleepiness gets too strong. Even though my supervisors haven't said anything about my productivity I have trouble believing that they aren't going to fire me. I saw a cardiologist and they don't know why my heart races like this, they're ordering more tests. 

I was hanging out with a guy I met on Hinge for the past month and a half. We had a good time together and he was always very affectionate when we were together. I didn't know where it was going but since we never had sex I started to let myself hope that he actually liked me as a person or even wanted something real. We are both going home for thanksgiving and he is staying with his family for the next month. The last time I saw him we talked about hanging out when we're both back but he has been so unresponsive over text since then that I'm finally convinced he only ever wanted a distraction or some illusion of intimacy or someone to mess around with. It sucks because even if he doesn't have feelings for me he could at least care about me as a person, as a friend. But I don't think he does. 

I've never been in a real relationship and I see my friends make it look so easy, literally never being single or having people constantly interested in them when they are single. I don't think anyone will ever love me romantically, or even like me enough to want me to be their girlfriend. I'm not pretty, I'm shy and awkward, sensitive, and come with all this mental illness shit that no one wants to deal with. At this point I know I'm likely always going to have these mental illnesses. Living with my parents makes me feel lifeless and depressed but living alone basically does too, I don't even know if I want to go back anymore since my lease is up at the end of december. I'd have to find a new place and I wouldn't even be living with my friend anymore. I'd be even more alone and I already felt so alone. And it seems like this guy probably doesn't give a fuck whether I come back or not.

I do pretty much want to kill myself but I've been more suicidal than this before and somehow made it through. In a lot of ways I am lucky, I have a job, supportive parents, a handful of friends.

,depression,"I'm not sure if this belongs here but here is a summary for anybody who might read this.
Last year i went into the highschool entrance exam . i   had to take anti-depressant pills for 6 months (then my mom said i didn't need them . I obliged to not worry her) i had several anxiety and panic attacks during school but didn't tell most of them to people not to worry them not that i have a lot of people to tell. We move often so often that i haven't lived in a place for more than 1.5 years so the friends i did have ,i left and now i am unable to make friends since i don't care enough. I am currently  going to a science highschool which consists of some of the smartest students in the country and makes me feel like an absolute  moron. My parents  know about my attacks they dont think more of it not that they don't know they just dont want to understand that there happy and joyfull daughter is not that happy and i can understand that so i dont tell them anything, my brothers dont care. Of course  there is more to the shit pile that is me but i dont want to be a bore


 I have realised that i think about my death alot during  the times that i am alone (which is a lot more than i could ever imagine ) . I make these wierd scenarios  about me dying  how it would happen and what the people around  me  feel about it. The wierd thing is im ok with it . The only reason im not dead is because  i dont want the only people in this world who care about me sad . But im sure that in the next 4 years (until the university entrance exam) i will have attempted suicide at least once 
Im still not sure if this is me just wanting attention , my anxiety speaking or me being suicidal.  .sorry for blabbering

We move often so often that i haven&amp;#39;t lived in a place for more than 1.5 years so the friends i did have ,i left and now i am unable to make friends since i don&amp;#39;t care enough. I am currently  going to a science highschool which consists of some of the smartest students in the country and makes me feel like an absolute  moron. My parents  know about my attacks they dont think more of it not that they don&amp;#39;t know they just dont want to understand that there happy and joyfull daughter is not that happy and i can understand that so i dont tell them anything, my brothers dont care. Of course  there is more to the shit pile that is me but i dont want to be a bore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have realised that i think about my death alot during  the times that i am alone (which is a lot more than i could ever imagine ) . I make these wierd scenarios  about me dying  how it would happen and what the people around  me  feel about it. The wierd thing is im ok with it . The only reason im not dead is because  i dont want the only people in this world who care about me sad . But im sure that in the next 4 years (until the university entrance exam) i will have attempted suicide at least once 
Im still not sure if this is me just wanting attention , my anxiety speaking or me being suicidal.  .sorry for blabbering 
Ps . Sorry for my english its not my main language
Pps. i also posted this in &lt;a href=""/r/anxiety""&gt;r/anxiety&lt;/a&gt; since i dont know what&amp;#39;s  wrong with me&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I’m a male. 21 years old. 

I want to start off by saying that I’ve been going to a psychiatrist and therapist and am currently on medication. 

Low confidence, extreme low self worth, social anxiety. 

Ever since I was younger I would feel hopeless and worthless. I would always think that I’m going to to die one day from myself. But I don’t think I would ever do it. 

Here’s the thing: my “depression” doesn’t doesn’t come out of the sky. It comes from my thoughts, and my psychiatrist even agreed when I said I think it’s my thoughts that cause my depression. 

I actually believe that I don’t do anything useful. I actually think I have no future. 

I work in my family business and I constantly think that one day I’m going to just get kicked out. My dad and uncle both split their business 3 years ago, and I’m feeling like my brother will split with me. I’m not good at selling. But I’m really good at the details and background work, but I never think it’s valuable. I never credit my work and I genuinely don’t think I’m worth anything. My therapist proves me wrong every week, but I still fall into the thinking traps. 

Every few weeks I’ll go into a dark hole where I’ll feel worthless and feel like nothing matters because I’m doomed to fail. My mom says “why are you so negative when I am so positive?” My mom is so amazing and can handle any stress, while I “break down” from stress...since 2nd grade. I always had breakdowns especially when I didn’t understand the school work. 

So basically I get almost all the depressive symptoms: hopeless, worthless, suicidal thoughts, sad, feeling of drowning, crying, pain in my heart and feeling like I can’t move on. 

But I have triggers: my dad was in a bad mood and said something mean to me. I internalized it and took an online quiz on careers for me and I answered no to all the skills questions and I felt like I had no good skills and got hopeless and felt like I was going to be homeless. 

Another trigger is when I see someone successful. Seeing my 16 year old brother being so great at selling makes me ruminating about how I’m worthless. Seeing both my twin cousins have wives and kids at 21 years old makes me feel down. Especially because I know I’m never going to be able to get married. 

I have no friends and I’m an outcast in my family. I hate parties, don’t believe in religion but nobody knows, I just feel like a bad person. I sometimes think I don’t deserve to live. 

But realistically I have everything. Loving parents, a roof, food, clothes, healthy. 

Except I worry about my future. I worry and I get depressed.

,depression,"Hi. 
I’m 21 years old and I live in a shithole of a country in Europe. I’m a pretty average guy, used to have a solid social life in my teenage years, been in healthy(ish) relationships, had a lot of friends, so everything was quite normal about me.
However, I feel like I’m struggling in life and my mental health is just going downhill. This feeling has been going on for about 2-3 years now. I always thought of myself as a smart guy, did fine in school, so ever since I was a little kid, I knew I had a bright future ahead of me. So did my family. 

Well, that changed in these past times. I dropped out of 2 universities in the last 3 years. Moved in with my ex and had to move back home 3 months later because our daily fights got out of hand. I got myself a dead-end job, which is to sit in a store 11 hours a day and ask customers the exact same fucking questions. I’ve been here for 2 years now. My salary is a joke, but considering that I’m basically not doing anything, I have no right to complain. I always thought I had more in me, and now I just consider myself a huge, huge failure. 
I’ve come to the point where I have completely lost interest in everything in life. Nothing brings me joy. I’m neutral about everything. I lost the ability to develop romantic feelings. I’m lonely but I love being alone. The only two things I enjoy is music and smoking weed with my friends who sticked around. I feel like I fucked my whole life up, even though I had potential in me. 

Now that I’ve finished my whining, I want to ask you people about one specific problem. I’ve been having issues with my stomach through all this time. I wake up every morning - literally every morning - feeling sick, I sometimes throw up, and it never stops. I could puke anytime I want. I have zero appetite and I barely eat. It never stops and I can’t live with it. I hate waking up every day, knowing I have to deal with this shit. I’ve tried visiting a doctor but it proved to be pointless. I know it’s a nerve based issue. I stress and overthink a lot, that’s when I feel it the most. Has any of you experienced a similar problem? If so, how’d you manage to cope with it?

,depression,"Hi everyone,

I am currently considering switching career paths to something new.

When I was in college, I frequently had panic attacks due to my high levels of anxiety. During one of them I very dumbly spouted suicidal comments and the police were called. They took me to the hospital and I was evaluated by a doctor, who thought I was fine. I ultimately went home without being hospitalized.

Unfortunately, in my medical records it says that I was brought to the hospital on a 5150 hold (a psych hold in CA). 

I'm pretty sure I'm banned from joining the military, law enforcement, firefighting, being a correctional officer, obtaining a security clearance, or obtaining a pilot's license. Also, I'm sure I'll have a difficult time becoming a doctor or a lawyer in states that have licensing application questions that ask for specific mental health information.

I'm so depressed about this. I feel like having a mental health record is the same as a criminal record.

,depression,"I think most of my pain and suffering boils down to this. I always ask this question in different ways with different contexts and never get much in the way of answers. 

I don't want to do anything. And it isn't because i sit around all day in my parents basement and play video games and don't socialize. I have my own apartment, a job, a car, a circle of friends, and most importantly I'm going to college to become a teacher. 

Why a teacher? Because it's the least miserable thing I could think of. I have to feel like I'm making a difference in this world and that people will remember me when I'm gone. That's the only thing that matters whether it's a good or bad legacy we will see in time, but I don't want my name forgotten. 

Every job, including being a teacher sucks to me. I hate working, and I hate living. Everyday I get up, cry in the shower, get dressed and try to put effort into my appearance, I go out to either work or to run errands and I try to practice social skills and combat my anxiety I've had since I was a little kid. I think I do a good job for the most part. I bust my ass at work, come home, finish all of my homework, and then cry myself to sleep for 2-4 hours. 

It never gets better. I don't feel anything but sadness, and I don't feel attached to any of the people in my life. I can fake a full range of emotions but it honestly makes me seem neurotic and edgy. I will cycle through them too quickly, I'll misread the situation sometimes, or fall into those ""oh I'm supposed to be quiet right now"" moments. I can be insensitive and I just play it off by claiming its sarcasm. 

I'm not autistic, I've been tested for that, I'm just like emotionally numbed except for anger and sadness. Which feed eachother in a loop. 

Right now it's becoming difficult to do any work because I'm just so defeated by this existence. I'm almost done with my English major and I hate it. The stories we analyze make me think more about how I hate humanity. It's all stories about whores and thieves and zealots and just horrible things. Why is college literature so fucked up like this? I have no problem actually understanding or making claims for the works, but they really just depress me. 

I'm disgusted by human beings and their hedonism. I'm so tired of people having fun at the expense of others and I'm so mad at people chasing success so ravenously that people like me are seen as stains of shit for not doing so. I don't want to do that except for the fact that it's the only way to be respected in this world. Nobody respects teachers... in fact most people make fun of them. 

I don't want to join the rat race, and honestly have none of the skills to do so, yet I don't want to continue down my career path either. Is life really worth it if I just cry my eyes out everyday and cringe at everything I see around me? Nothing about this country goes the way I want it to, nothing in my group of friends goes the way I want it to (I'm not the leader of the group as they would put it), nothing in my family is any good (all of my siblings and cousins fight and hate eachother at this point), and nothing in my romantic life goes good (still a complete virgin).

I don’t want to die or harm myself but I just feel like my life is just so pointless and I don’t have anything to look forward to. 
I used to be so happy and chill and really social and always kept myself busy. I wish I was still in my teen phase before all this started.
I actually just turned 21 on Wednesday and I feel as though these feelings got more intense since that day. I just want my old self back so much.
I just feel so alone and like I can’t share how I’m feeling with anyone as well.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I compare myself to others and I come up short in many places. I am extremely lonely. I don't have friends at all because I am undesirable. I don't have any talents, hobbies or notable skills because I wasted my years focusing on things that didn't matter. I don't have a proper education because I am not mature.

I feel floored and crushed at the sight of others my age doing so much better than me. People who went to school with me are much more fulfilled and their lives are an adventure. I am quite pathetic and stupid in comparison.

I live each day suffering the cringe, disappointment, deep shame and anger from flashbacks of things I've said, done, or hadn't done. I have more regrets than I can count, more shameful moments than most people, and I am disgusted when I look in the mirror. If I reach old age, I will look back on my youth as a waste and a train wreck.

I am completely alone in my misery. Therapy has failed, medication has been ineffective, I cannot tell people because the public opinion is all about positive thinking and meditation and ""change your negative attitude, don't you know that if you believe hard enough things will get better?"".

I have a negative relationship with my family, I was born into circumstances that are insurmountable and unchangeable, and my childhood and adolescence were very bad.

I've wasted so much and I didn't have much to work with to begin with. I am a waste, I am pathetic, mediocre, lowly, despicable, disgusting, immature, retarded, slow, unimaginably stupid, and far far behind where I should be.

I have done worse than the average and I am a failure through and through. I failed school, and failed in every area of my life. I have no achievements to date or positive traits to note. I cannot change. This is what I am, and I cannot live with myself.

,depression,"I have two friends who are chronically depressed.

I think we get along... Because I have a lot of social anxiety... Which is just worsening with work, which causes me to be anxious about my future, as I have a lot of doubt in my own communication skills and a lot of times I just feel like maybe I'm an imposter in my field.

However, when I share my own feelings about my anxiety, I feel empty inside... I feel like I'm weird for even mentioning it...

I check up on him when im not with him and make sure hes ok, I try to talk to him or hear him out, be there for him and support him and I also try little things to make him happy.

,depression,"I haven’t been to the therapist in months. I was seeing someone I really liked, but had to stop because she ended up not being able to take my insurance. I tried to stay positive about it all and use the coping mechanisms I learned from my therapist to get me through the waiting period between leaving her and finding a new therapist. Except I still haven’t found a therapist. And it’s been at least a month.  

I’ve called and emailed at least 5 different counseling services in my city and I haven’t heard back from a single one. Most of them I’ve called and emailed more than 3 times. My anxiety is starting to get the best of me and I’m starting to think I’m being too persistent and the counseling places are annoyed by me so that’s why they won’t call me back. 

Within this past week I’ve been noticing that I just feel...off. I can’t really explain it, but I don’t feel like me. Half of the time it feels like I’m just floating through time as if I’m in a dream. When I do things (I.e. walking down the stairs, going outside to my car, cooking, washing the dishes, etc.) i have to stop and think about what I just did because it feels like I’m imagining that I walked downstairs or I just went out into the cold to my car. It’s as if I’m not 100% present and feeling very foggy/groggy. Or as if I’m not taking in the things I’m doing in the moment and forgetting about them a second later. I feel like I have no emotions, no feelings towards anyone or anything. Just numb. I tried to cry the other day and I got a few tears out, but I didn’t even feel like wasting the time or energy on crying. So I just stopped. But I still felt terrible. 

I don’t really know what I’m trying to get at with this post. Maybe reassurance? Or someone to explain what the heck this feeling is?

I was seeing someone I really liked, but had to stop because she ended up not being able to take my insurance. I tried to stay positive about it all and use the coping mechanisms I learned from my therapist to get me through the waiting period between leaving her and finding a new therapist. Except I still haven’t found a therapist. And it’s been at least a month.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve called and emailed at least 5 different counseling services in my city and I haven’t heard back from a single one. Most of them I’ve called and emailed more than 3 times. My anxiety is starting to get the best of me and I’m starting to think I’m being too persistent and the counseling places are annoyed by me so that’s why they won’t call me back. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Within this past week I’ve been noticing that I just feel...off. I can’t really explain it, but I don’t feel like me. Half of the time it feels like I’m just floating through time as if I’m in a dream. When I do things (I.e. walking down the stairs, going outside to my car, cooking, washing the dishes, etc.) i have to stop and think about what I just did because it feels like I’m imagining that I walked downstairs or I just went out into the cold to my car. It’s as if I’m not 100% present and feeling very foggy/groggy. Or as if I’m not taking in the things I’m doing in the moment and forgetting about them a second later. I feel like I have no emotions, no feelings towards anyone or anything. Just numb. I tried to cry the other day and I got a few tears out, but I didn’t even feel like wasting the time or energy on crying. So I just stopped. But I still felt terrible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know what I’m trying to get at with this post. Maybe reassurance? Or someone to explain what the heck this feeling is? &lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"

I’m a 25M and I have nothing going on in life.

I’m in college as much older than anyone else having failed a year already of college and failed a year of school. I hate my course and I hate learning and I’m not really attending or doing work, but it’s salvageable for now. I’m in my final year now, but it’s a prestigious college and I could make a bit of money if I do well and feel it’s too much of a sunk cost to quit. I’m also partly jealous of some people I attended with who used to laugh at me are doing well and I want to match them.

In terms of dating, I had a few drunk one night stands, but that’s it. I’ve never been able to attract girls in my social circle, so all my dates have been from Bumble. I have autism and can be nervous, so have had 10-15 first dates and zero second dates or anything after which just feels like a kick in the balls after every date I get rejected or ghosted - despite presenting different aspects of my personality each time. When I was at home from college about an hour and a half away over summer I met a very beautiful woman my age, who I got on with super well and chatting with was great. We spoke for several hours a day over a week via text - but then she went quietish before we were set to meet. She told me she’d been raped so cancelled. I sympathised with her initially. She was sending frantic voice notes and a couple of times said I sound like her rapist (but said it wasn’t my fault), she didn’t seem eager to reschedule either - kinda just leaving it to me, so I irritatedly said we should cut things altogether. Prior to her mentioning her rape, she mentioned jokingly (but kinda serious) she’d be appalled if I gave her an early kiss, but she was mentioning her one night stands and stuff which annoyed me a little (probably a bit irrationally) - i didn’t mention this to her. But at the time I found it annoying that it felt like she was throwing it in my face. We stopped speaking for a week. A week later, I sent her a message saying I didn’t show her adequate understanding but she said she was fine being friends but being unsure about dating for now and needed time but the events led her to go to therapy. I said I was super happy she went to therapy but interested in her romantically and would find it difficult to put my romantic feelings aside for her.

While I was aware that rape is severe and affects a lot, I wasn’t aware of how severely it effects people and just assumed she’d trust me because I wasn’t a rapist. It’s only recently come to my idea how big a thing it was to tell me this before we’d met. People don’t normally trust me with deep personal info, as I’m the strange guy that cracks jokes. I messaged her today and decided to bite the bullet which is three months later, just sending a message about how I liked talking to her. (I have been on dates since and had kinda put her to back of mind since then and haven’t really been too upset for a long time about other women rejecting me). She hasn’t responded and I don’t think she will as I behaved like an ass. Tbh I feel a bit pathetic, as most people only get super upset over people they’ve gone out with not matches on the web. 

In terms of family, I just have my mum who’s the adult I speak to. But she used to call a lot (2 times a day) which she’s now reduced to three times a week, but I still find that a bit troublesome as a lot of the time I don’t want to talk to people as I feel depressed. She’s annoyed at me today but I haven’t told her the situation on why I’m miserable but she gets stressed a lot, and threatened to travel to my university town  if I didn’t tell her why I was miserable this evening. I said id tell her in the morning (I don’t know if I will)

I was crying a few days ago for an hour a few days ago and I don’t really know why. I’ve always felt I’m underachieving in life and feel like a dick. I haven’t cried in about seven years when my grandma died but cried three days on the trot.

I do have a therapist to talk things over with, but still not much seems to work he did help me with some of the messages I sent the girl. I’ve been depressed for about six years and had three sets of antidepressants and six different counsellor/therapists and I’ve fairly consistently wished I was dead.

I’d feel a bit shy talking to my current roommates about my issues. I have two other friends who know I have mental issues and tbf to them seem to care and have offered to listen if I want to message them but have kinda ignored FB messages asking to go for a casual beer.

I’ve no desire to commit suicide, but I’d be glad to have a heart attack or something.

I’ve been miserable the past few days but I got out of bed, took a shower and wore clean clothes for the first time today. I’ve also started smoking again but I’m quitting from this instant.

I pray to god she replies, but i know full well she won’t and I don’t want to load this baggage on her plus I’d probably still be miserable if we were dating/fucking/married. 

I’ve picked up the Mamba Mentality book today. I’ve always been a fan of his work ethic and attitude  - hopefully i can develop Kobe’s resilience to my issues with life, women and studies (and just being a dick in general to this girl who was better than me).",t2_6a10ec1a,False,,0,False,I’m a waste of space (for now),[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jykpx9,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606029149.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I’m a 25M and I have nothing going on in life.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I'm 15M and lately I haven't been feeling myself. At the beginning of quarantine, I fell into a really depressive state. My life was (and still is) pretty good; I have a large group of really good friends, a girlfriend, and a really supportive family. But I'm just not comfortable with sharing with them how I feel because I don't want to be a burden. Now, school has really not helped, and I feel myself falling back into that depression. I'm weeks behind in a few of my classes, and I don't have the motivation to do anything. Not to mention both of my grandfathers, who were huge inspirations to me, passed away recently.

What also hasnt helped is my girlfriend. I haven't been dating her long, but I've started to really fall for her. At first it was going really well, but now it seems like she's losing interest in us. I ask her about it and she says she's fine, but deep down I know something is off. I don't want to be pushy, but she talks to me less, and just doesn't seem like she wants to hold a conversation.  I want to give her space and let her do her own thing but I find myself constantly stressing over her and how she's feeling, especially about us.

I've been nothing but good to her, and try my best to not stress her out, but it really seems like she's not enjoying us anymore. Normally I would just tell myself to stop overthinking it and relax, but I also recently quit smoking weed and now my anxiety is through the roof. I don't wanna end up dependent on weed, but life seemed so much better when I was high all the time. 

I really just need a hug and someone to talk to; I have years worth of built up emotions, but nobody I feel comfortable sharing it with.

TLDR; I'm dealing with terrible anxiety, death, and just an overall loss of motivation to do anything. I'm also constantly worrying about my relationship (even though she says there is nothing to worry about), and it's getting harder and harder to get out of bed everyday.

At first it was going really well, but now it seems like she&amp;#39;s losing interest in us. I ask her about it and she says she&amp;#39;s fine, but deep down I know something is off. I don&amp;#39;t want to be pushy, but she talks to me less, and just doesn&amp;#39;t seem like she wants to hold a conversation.  I want to give her space and let her do her own thing but I find myself constantly stressing over her and how she&amp;#39;s feeling, especially about us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been nothing but good to her, and try my best to not stress her out, but it really seems like she&amp;#39;s not enjoying us anymore. Normally I would just tell myself to stop overthinking it and relax, but I also recently quit smoking weed and now my anxiety is through the roof. I don&amp;#39;t wanna end up dependent on weed, but life seemed so much better when I was high all the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really just need a hug and someone to talk to; I have years worth of built up emotions, but nobody I feel comfortable sharing it with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TLDR; I&amp;#39;m dealing with terrible anxiety, death, and just an overall loss of motivation to do anything. I&amp;#39;m also constantly worrying about my relationship (even though she says there is nothing to worry about), and it&amp;#39;s getting harder and harder to get out of bed everyday. 
Should I go to a therapist?&lt;/p&gt;

I can’t seem to get out of it. The depression. I don’t know what to do but I’ve been fighting it for such a long time and with more and more time I feel like I’m losing . 

I’ve lived alone without family for six years- everyone is across the country and I miss them. I haven’t had friends in years either except one. The one who was my best friend - we dated. 3 years here. He’s the only one that lives here. Long story short, we broke up- and I dated a narcissistic person for a few months- then me and that guy broke up thank goodness. My best friend/ex has been back in my life as an amazing support system- but he has a life, a happy one and gets busy when I have nothing going for me day after day. I wait for his texts and support because I feel I need the support and hugs and time from him after years and years of being alone. And when we haven’t seen each other in days, I overthink and assume he’s tired of helping me. That’s my depression talking most likely. Hes just living his life and it can’t revolve around me. I know that I’ve been too dependent. On him. I don’t know how to break that streak- after years of being alone, of abusive relationships of being just tired after giving it my all.

I’m stuck. I’m taking a leave of absence from work next week for two weeks and I’m nervous that I won’t be able to heal in that time frame . I’ve laid in bed for the past day almost just doing nothing unable to move . It’s my fault I’m not taking action and pushing through. It’s my fault I’m not changing my way of thinking . I just want you to come over and hold me again like you have been doing. But I know you’re busy and I need to respect you too. 
I don’t know what to do. It’s quiet . It’s just me. I try to entertain myself in the comfort of my home because I don’t feel strong enough to go out and do things. Playing Pokémon on my tv, watching movies, coloring in the sea life in my coloring book, reading a book, it’s all just- I just can’t take it anymore day after day. The silence. The feeling I don’t matter. And even if I do matter- I don’t feel it’s enough to match the loneliness I feel. I need him. I need my future husband- but yet even I know that’s not what I need because I don’t want to be toxic for you and drag you down. Maybe by the time we meet I’ll be healed.

,depression,"I'm currently sitting in my living room crying at 3am. I wanted to take a shower but I'm scared I'll wake my parents up and now I'm waiting for it to become light out so that I can shower and go to bed. I have serious problems with insomnia and sleep procrastination and it's been getting worse over the past weeks.

2 years ago I was working a shitty supermarket job for minimum wage. I absolutely loathe supermarket work and struggled to get through my business degree without quitting. I eventually ended up in therapy to deal with depressive feelings, a good portion of which was caused by my job. I worked there for 3 years and then I quit to pursue my dream job.

So I went to school to become a professional gardener/landscaper. I had a good paying internship in the field and even though I always had to work twice as hard to prove myself because I was the only woman working in the company I really enjoyed my job. It was very rewarding, I was outside a lot, it paid well, and I got really good grades.

Then last June it all came crashing down. I had been suffering from inflamed joints in my hands for a few months and decided to check with a doctor because I could barely use my hands anymore. Turns out I have a form of rheumatism and the joints in my hand wouldn't go back to normal as long as I kept doing the job I was studying for. I was also starting to get aches in my knees and neck and I couldn't even open my hands anymore after making a fist.
There was no possible way I could do that job for the rest of my life, and to pursue a less physical job in the same field I had to finish the course, which I couldn't because I couldn't do the physical job, so I was forced to quit.

It's been 4 months now and I'm back working the shitty supermarket job. I just had 2 weeks off and coming back made me realise just how absolutely awful I find my job. I can't stand it. However there's very little job opportunity in my area and I can't quit because I'm still paying off my driver's license which takes over half my paycheck each month. I just feel like shit and I don't know what to do. I have no appetite anymore, I'm basically surviving on croissants I buy at the supermarket and tea and coffee. I stopped going to the gym due to working a high risk job and the fear of accidentally getting my family sick. I barely eat or sleep, when I sleep I struggle to get out of bed before 2pm, sometimes I don't get out at all. I just feel worthless at the moment.

,depression,"This year has been really fucking bad on me and it’s making me more and more suicidal. In january I was raped and talked shit on my by ex girlfriend. In february I was ignored by all my friends. March I was abused mentally and physically. April I was cheated on, abused, talked shit on, had rumors spread about me, lost friends. In may I met the love of my life and things started going up from there. Until my parents started fighting and my dad cheated on my mom, they then split until this month. In June me and my ex broke up and I started dating the love of my life, but life felt wrong, I started taking drugs to cope with the pain and it just made it worse and now I get withdrawals when I think about them. In july my life started to seem like it was gettint better, until my life long best friend became fake and toxic and a horrible person and outcasted me and my sister. Then in august my om started having seizures and it made her look lifeless and those images are stuck in my head, she stopped but it’s still stuck. Me and the love of my life went to the Pocono mountains with my family and we also went camping with her family so I thought things would get better, until it didn’t. In september me and the love of my life started fighting alot and became a little toxic. In october we were fighting almost daily and almost broke up a few times. We were supposed to go camping again in october but never did, then my aunt died of coronavirus, then the love of my life got grounded for not doing school work and thats when it got really bad for me and I started to cut for a way to cope and I know its horrible but I can’t stop. In november, this month, me and her broke up, everything is just pain now. She told me countless times she doesn’t love me anymore and she’s in love with her ex. I tried to overdose on iron pills but I wasn’t strong enough to do it, I cut more and I can’t even eat now. It’s been 4 days since I ate a full meal, I’ve had half a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup and a bite of a chicken tender and like 2 cups of iced tea. I’m falling deeper into this dark abyss.

In january I was raped and talked shit on my by ex girlfriend. In february I was ignored by all my friends. March I was abused mentally and physically. April I was cheated on, abused, talked shit on, had rumors spread about me, lost friends. In may I met the love of my life and things started going up from there. Until my parents started fighting and my dad cheated on my mom, they then split until this month. In June me and my ex broke up and I started dating the love of my life, but life felt wrong, I started taking drugs to cope with the pain and it just made it worse and now I get withdrawals when I think about them. In july my life started to seem like it was gettint better, until my life long best friend became fake and toxic and a horrible person and outcasted me and my sister. Then in august my om started having seizures and it made her look lifeless and those images are stuck in my head, she stopped but it’s still stuck. Me and the love of my life went to the Pocono mountains with my family and we also went camping with her family so I thought things would get better, until it didn’t. In september me and the love of my life started fighting alot and became a little toxic. In october we were fighting almost daily and almost broke up a few times. We were supposed to go camping again in october but never did, then my aunt died of coronavirus, then the love of my life got grounded for not doing school work and thats when it got really bad for me and I started to cut for a way to cope and I know its horrible but I can’t stop. In november, this month, me and her broke up, everything is just pain now. She told me countless times she doesn’t love me anymore and she’s in love with her ex. I tried to overdose on iron pills but I wasn’t strong enough to do it, I cut more and I can’t even eat now. It’s been 4 days since I ate a full meal, I’ve had half a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup and a bite of a chicken tender and like 2 cups of iced tea. I’m falling deeper into this dark abyss.

,depression,"This is what I learned.

1. ""When they lose hope, hope for them."" He told me that it's normal for depressed people to lose hope. But they can draw hope from us (as supporters) when we have hope. When we show that we have hope, it rubs off on them. :)

2. ""Capitalize on your 'breaks'"". This is a marathon. For us SOs supporting people with depression, we need to be aware of times when we can relax. Self care. We need to tale care of ourselves because our depressed loved ones draw strength from us. 

3. ""Realize you have limits."" This is connected to #2. We're not endless, so we need to pace ourselves if we want to last. Realizing we have limits would make us wary of our own health and prevent us from breaking down too.

4. ""We have two motivators - external and internal. External motivators are our friends, family, loved ones. Internal motivators are our inner goals, objectives.. etc."" Depressed people lose their internal motivators . As their SOs, we're probably their external motivator, and it's our job to help them find their own internal motivation.

,depression," Every morning, I reluctantly shuffle out of bed to my mum screaming at me to wake up. Depending on if it’s the weekend or not, I will either arrive 30 mins late for school, or stay home and do nothing with my life all day. I feel guilty for even thinking about trying to get better, trying to move forward in life. I hold so much guilt and shame from times in my life when I was a selfish asshole, labels and marks I can never shake off.

Oh and by the way, I am really really fat, I am 5’6 and weigh 94kg, from when I used to eat junk food and never exercise because I thought I couldn’t because of severe clubfoot in both of my feet that was treated very badly by doctors when I was a kid, where I couldn’t run or do physical activity for even a moderate amount of time, lest I risk excruciating pain for the rest of the day. But it wasn’t because of that, I’m just pathetic, no goals and aspirations in life, constantly paranoid and anxious about the future.

I play the guitar I suppose, a few other instruments too. But for a while now, the fun has been sucked out of that as well. My dad constantly pressuring me to play for his sake, as well as not having anything to play on guitar anymore, basically ruined that for me. I still play it, but it’s no longer fun to learn a song I heard once that sounded cool.

I know I am a toxic, shitty person. I don’t deserve to be around others, I would only ever scare them away with my bullshit. I deeply messed up my relationship with a girl I loved very much, that was three years ago and I’m still not over it. I feel unimaginable guilt and shame for ruining the relationship by coming on too strongly and not controlling my tendency to cry and isolate myself whenever we get into arguments. I don’t trust myself with a relationship after that one, history will repeat itself yet again, I just know it.

My relationship with my parents isn’t really ruined yet, but it’s getting there. I know they’re trying their best. They constantly ask me “what’s wrong?”, and “what are you feeling right now?”. But I don’t think they understand just how unexplainable depression can be. They seem to think of it as just ‘being sad’. It’s so so much more than that.

I’m 16 years old and I don’t even want to know what I want to study in uni, hell, I don’t even know if I can go in the state I am right now. I had dreams and aspirations during young naïve parts of my live, where I actually felt happy, because I wasn’t overthinking my future. But those dreams and aspirations have been lost in the sands of time.

Everyone in my classes at school seems to have the whole world in the palm of their hand. Everyone is over confident, smiling, being with friends, knowing that their future is going to be just great. I had friends, until I pushed them away for what, for me to be alone for a while?? What a selfish, nasty bastard I must be.

Nothing gives me emotions anymore. I can no longer feel joy, anger, disgust, surprise. I have one mood, and that is a blank, melancholic mood, that is colder than any ice or cold thing you will ever touch.

I think back to some bad things I did in my youth, and constantly ruminate over the worst case scenario of what could happen to me. Then I believe that that worse case scenario will actually happen irl. It seems that the true enemy in my body is my own mind and imagination.

I’ve been having very scary delusions and paranoia recently. Like for example, i’m scared of being watched by my school through my webcam on my school pc, i’m afraid of people looking through my window while I sleep, I’m afraid that, while sleeping, someone will come into our house and steal our stuff or worse, harm us. I’m afraid of being arrested, even if I did nothing wrong. I’m afraid that I have unknowingly installed a virus on my pc, so that a criminal can track my keystrokes and find out personal information, passwords, and my card number. Why do I care so much about all this? I thought i hated my life!

So why, life? Why am I here, when the only purpose I serve in life is making sure I don’t do something drastic like kill myself because “my family would be sad” or whatever. Because there’s not much reason to live if all I do is just float through life, not making anything of myself.

In fact, that’s the only reason why I stay on this mortal coil day in day out, is because I’m too much of a pussy to see what death will be like. I feel stuck between these two worlds, a purgatory, and I can’t get to neither of them.

,depression,"First time posting here, but this is something that I have been struggling with for a long time and I want to get it off my chest (at least a little).

Some backstory: I'm an Asian male, 160cm tall and in my late teens. I was born premature and have been struggling with health concerns through most of my life, however none of the pain from surgeries or parental pressure ever bothered me, compared to my height. My height is the one, vivid defining factor that dictated my relationships, school life, confidence, etc. 

Ever since my peers started outgrowing me, the casual ridicule from people (good people, who often don't even know how much their words or jokes hurt) about my height slowly whittled away at my confidence and self esteem. I have always been social and outgoing, and play numerous sports, but those all too often are placed on the back-seat as compared to my height. It seems like no matter what I do, nothing can ever traverse the chasm between my height and that of my peers, and the sheer lack of respect people have for me due to my height has resulted in me slowly becoming more and more depressed over time. Relationships have been few and far between, and I am ashamed to say the experiences I've had as well as the countless comments from women (often casually) about my height has resulted in me having a low opinion of them in general, and thus affecting my empathy for them. Nowadays, I only look for hookups and casual sex, the thought that I could never be enough for someone due to my height being so deeply ingrained in me I've stopped thinking of having any emotional connection to women.

Nowadays, I go out, socialize, party etc but inside, no matter how many friends I make, how f**ed up I get at parties, how much fun I have, I can't stop feeling hollow inside, and angry that I couldn't at least be born average height, even just a little taller. 

The worst part of it all is the fact that I was even lucky enough to be born with good features, and just had to get the short end of the stick (literally) with my height. 
So many times I've heard comments like ""He's kinda hot, but his height..."" or ""I'd smash if he was taller."" I've even considered limb lengthening surgery but that's really the only driving force I have right now, the prospect of one day being regarded as a real human being compared to the midget I am right now being absolutely amazing. 

I use various drugs to numb myself to my feelings, but those brief flashes of happiness soon fade in the light of reality - that nothing I do will ever really help, even limb lengthening will only make me slightly taller at best. I wear insoles to increase my height, and with my height being so short, they help me be regarded as an equal at least by girls, and even guys. I can't be taken seriously or as a male by a lot of my fair weather friends, and honestly have been considering just ending it all sooner or later rather than struggle through life being mocked and disregarded for something I couldn't control.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe its a cry for help, maybe I'm just frustrated and this is me venting. If I try too hard at stuff and be competitive I'm ""compensating for something"", if I get into a relationship oftentimes girls' girlfriends, etc will give them peer pressure to stop dating me after realizing my height, and ridicule me constantly behind my back. The amount of times something good was broken apart due to this is crazy - an example being how one of my closest friends, someone I thought I could connect with during my highschool years completely ghosted me and cut off contact due to her friends making fun of me and her for talking to me. This hurt especially because I had been there for her when she was going through a lot previously, and wasn't even trying to get into a relationship, but the sheer fact that me, a short guy, could ever be worth talking to seemed to fly over most of her friends' heads. This incident in particular is what caused a lot of my current self destructive behaviour, not caring about university, just going out and getting f**ed up every night to feel alive, hooking up with prostitutes and talking to them, finding them better friends than most of the 'normal' women I know, too.

The funniest part is that online, I have the life I want to live, the whole package. I have a livestream I started, where I simply just look at the camera, smile sometimes etc and chat with viewers, and pull a large amount of money from the fantasy they have with who I supposedly am. There, they don't know my actual height, and thus only see my face and personality. I've had instagram pages with thousands of followers using my appearance. Its so shattering to know what just one factor invalidates all of this, that if I was just taller I could be that guy everyone looks up to, the guy that f**ks around and is the life of every party, the guy who has that magnetic attraction for girls around him.

&lt;p&gt;My second question is, is it normal for a depressed person not to know what they&amp;#39;re feeling about their relationship? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Im sorry if this text is too long and i dont know who else to talk about this with. Her depression is starting to affect me but i love her too much to leave and i know that i was going to lose myself the minute i got with her.&lt;/p&gt;

Depression allows us to realize our timely end, we don’t have those chemicals of happiness that allow us to go on through life smiling and ignore it. 
We’re the folks that imagine the train de-railing, the bridge collapsing while we’re under it. the car tire blowing... our end. It’s obsession. 
But is it? We all KNOW we die. 
I know I am a pretty woman, most upbeat pretty women don’t “look” depressed. So I normally attract good looking, shallow, fake people, until I talk... 
I’m very depressed, bi-polar, worse some years. The mania is what gets me out of the “funk” and I meet some friends though... 
. I’ll never have friends for long because the depression sets in, and I’m negative again.
Depression isn’t always what it looks like, that’s the thing with bi-polar. 
I feel there is a stigma towards people that take care of themselves that have mental illnesses.&lt;br/&gt;
The “your beautiful” just won’t cut my depression in half. We spend so much time cutting ourselves down that the compliments become NIL. 
I don’t have friends because of my mental illness.&lt;br/&gt;
I just seem to attract shallow, narrow minded people.&lt;/p&gt;

then collect crimson drops of inspiration

then why the careless mistake 

of trapping divine thoughts inside my carcass?


and if god does exist,

then i’m her forbidden mistress. 

i lure her into me,

and in rosy hues of light, the sky emits. 


while i’m to blame for the dimming brightness in her eyes, 

she gifts me with elaborate constellations.

because inside the ground lies my only fixation.

,depression,"I have had a really chaotic last two years of my life. For context, I’m 21[M]. I’m on a semester off from university because of a mix of COVID and taking a spell to work on myself.

Before the last semester ended I got into a bunch of trouble in my friendships around campus. I was being rightfully labeled as a man-whore and manipulative. From my perspective, I never saw the things I said or did as manipulative. When I had a one night stand or casual relationship I always put my intentions in the open.

This always lead to situations where someone would begin falling for me. As I explained I can’t/don’t want to be with them I would fall into a cycle of breaking a heart, being labeled a whore, then searching for further acceptance through companionship and sex.

I got into some very very dark spots in life because of this. Near October of 2019 I decided I wanted to break free of the cycle. I broke up with a girlfriend that always painted me as emotionally abusive for walking away from arguments, despite the strain it was putting on me mentally and emotionally.

As the title says, I don’t experience much emotion. I go through the motions and play the parts unconsciously. The only time I “feel” is when I am extremely depressed. It’s never a feeling of sadness. It’s more-so a tingling numb that I feel start in my fingers and work it’s way to the center of my chest before disbursing throughout the rest of my body.

I hate being in these ruts, but once I end up in one I fall victim to my own desire to feel. I constantly let the negative thoughts of others live rent free in my head so I can feel that numbness for a longer duration that it should.

I’m getting ready to return to University in the spring. Old friends are continuing rumors about me despite me having little or no contact with them in the last 8 months. I’ve tried reaching out for help from trusted friends. I’m either ignored or turned away by them now.

I feel so alone and this is the first negative mentality I have had in months that I’m unable to shake. I wanted to share it here since I’ve never been one to bother close friends with my problems.

While everyone else around hits 1k or 4k wow thanks for rubbing it in my face! Hell, even my friend got 25 orders for Christmas. Yay for HER. I AM happy for her but I AM also fed up and depressed that nothing better can happen for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I even made more production today BUT WHY DO I WASTE MY TIME. Finance has always been a trouble for me and no one is helping, not even family. So what do I do? My arm is hurt and needs recovery too  Concinve me of it (crochet/knitting) not being a waste of time. Convince me! I am very angry and I am trying to stay cool but dude, try this since 2014 and even since 2008. Convince me. That everything is going to be ok and that I&amp;#39;m not doing this for nothing. Convince me that I&amp;#39;ll get somewhere. Only 3 items sold since I bought my freaking website. So tell me, what is wrong. Please help me.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I have major depression since... i don't know anymore. And anxiety. And who knows what else.

I don't have money to get private help and here in Quebec, public mental health is a big mess. Never been able to see a psycharatrist since i'm not suicidal. I have ALL the other symptoms of depression, but no, i don't need real help, only a social worker (SW) that don't even understand what i'm explaining to them. Tried over 5 antidepressant with wether too much side effects or not helping much (i'm on Cymbalta atm, went up to 120mg, then got down gradually to 60mg and looking forward to stop eventually). Tried pairing with psychostimulants (Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall... Vyvance is too expensive), again, too much side effects. I have MS (my neurologist don't want to get involved and sends me to the SW), my Dad died 5 years ago (and all the friend's help offered magically disappeared 2 weeks later, still not over his death) and plenty of other stuff that would be too long to explain here... I only survive, nothing matters anymore. And now, i have to wait again, because ppl get depressed from the Covid and seasonal, so the services are overcrowded. So i'll keep surviving until it's the good time for me to reach for help again and taken seriously, without being any useful for anyone, not even knowing what i like anymore, ashamed of being unable to get myself out of this shithole alone.

I keep myself alive prob only for my 2 cats, but no, ""get on the list for a SW, maybe in a year you'll get to see one"".

So friends are all like ""you have to talk, you can't keep everyhing inside!"" So i talk. But when it gets too dark, they get embarrassed and don't want to get involved. Or when i turn off their silly advices (yoga, routine, push through my chronic pain, etc) they get mad at me and tell me to stop finding ""excuses"" to not get better. I don't blame them, no one likes negative shit. But gosh i lost friends because i wasn't healthy enough, happy enough, relatable enough for them. Not healing fast enough for them.

So i shut up. I can't trust anyone anymore.

Now i only have my 2 cats, my boyfriend of 9 years, whom has his own problems while trying to help me as much as he can with my MS, so i shut up as much as possible. And his friends; they like me, i like them, but i don't want them to know too much, can't handle this stupid judging drama anymore.

I'm so alone. I wish i was suicidal. Maybe then i would be taken seriously. I don't want to lie and take the place of someone who is a real danger for their own life. I'm stuck. I'm lost. I don't see the end. Medication don't help. SW don't help. What if psy don't help either? What's wrong with me? I'm fighting so hard to keep going. I'm afraid the day i'll be suicidal for real, it'll already be too late. But i'll wait. After winter. After covid. Hoping i'll make it through.

So i&amp;#39;ll keep surviving until it&amp;#39;s the good time for me to reach for help again and taken seriously, without being any useful for anyone, not even knowing what i like anymore, ashamed of being unable to get myself out of this shithole alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I keep myself alive prob only for my 2 cats, but no, &amp;quot;get on the list for a SW, maybe in a year you&amp;#39;ll get to see one&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So friends are all like &amp;quot;you have to talk, you can&amp;#39;t keep everyhing inside!&amp;quot; So i talk. But when it gets too dark, they get embarrassed and don&amp;#39;t want to get involved. Or when i turn off their silly advices (yoga, routine, push through my chronic pain, etc) they get mad at me and tell me to stop finding &amp;quot;excuses&amp;quot; to not get better. I don&amp;#39;t blame them, no one likes negative shit. But gosh i lost friends because i wasn&amp;#39;t healthy enough, happy enough, relatable enough for them. Not healing fast enough for them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i shut up. I can&amp;#39;t trust anyone anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now i only have my 2 cats, my boyfriend of 9 years, whom has his own problems while trying to help me as much as he can with my MS, so i shut up as much as possible. And his friends; they like me, i like them, but i don&amp;#39;t want them to know too much, can&amp;#39;t handle this stupid judging drama anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m so alone. I wish i was suicidal. Maybe then i would be taken seriously. I don&amp;#39;t want to lie and take the place of someone who is a real danger for their own life. I&amp;#39;m stuck. I&amp;#39;m lost. I don&amp;#39;t see the end. Medication don&amp;#39;t help. SW don&amp;#39;t help. What if psy don&amp;#39;t help either? What&amp;#39;s wrong with me? I&amp;#39;m fighting so hard to keep going. I&amp;#39;m afraid the day i&amp;#39;ll be suicidal for real, it&amp;#39;ll already be too late. But i&amp;#39;ll wait. After winter. After covid. Hoping i&amp;#39;ll make it through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long post. Needed to vent. If you read all the way through... appreciated, alot. Please be comprehensive about my English, not my primary language...&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah.&lt;/p&gt;

I conducted a market analysis, I had documents to prove that my worth was over $10 K higher than my pay at the time, then covid happened.

I’ve lost interest in my job this year, especially since I asked for a raise right before COVID - mind you, I waited a year making shit money in the new role, worked my ass off, earned my stripes, swallowed my anger and said “I’m going to show them that I’m worth more”. I conducted a market analysis, I had documents to prove that my worth was over $10 K higher than my pay at the time, then covid happened. It wasn’t until august that the company found some “normalcy” and was able to get back to that. My raise? Not even 1/3 of my estimated worth. Pocket change. I have been working for that company for eight years and still not breaking 50k. 
“Why don’t you go somewhere else?” You ask, well I have tried. I have submitted dozens of applications this year alone. Only two call backs, one interview, and didn’t get that job because “it’s early in my career”. A masters or certificate would help, but hey you need money to finance those!
I’m tired. I’m so, so tired. I’m tired of wasting time looking for side figs to supplement my income and have some sort of savings going on. I’m tired of being anchored down to a city and people that I’m dying to get away from but can’t seem to land a secure job to leave that behind. 
I’m so tired, and I’m making careless mistakes, and I’m beating myself up about that and that brings me here, to feeling low, sad, hopeless.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"thinking about my lack of relationships (non-romantic as well as romantic) just bums me out.

I really, really hate myself, so there's no chance in hell that I'll ever be in a relationship, but man, I'd be lying if I didn't say that it hurts nowadays.

,depression,"Hi there, sorry to bother with another sad story/rant/vent, but I just want to get this off my chest.
So, picture this: 28M, East European, graduated vet school in home country about 3 years ago. Good academic performance, worked hard to achieve that. 
I also worked during my studentship as a volunteer for my vet school and for some practice in home town to gain experience. I wanted to learn and do surgery, and I also had plans to get myself involved into regenerative medicine, or... experimental medicine/research. I was pretty motivated to do things. But then, graduation and life struck: 
- the practice that I used to volunteer for, could not hire me, so I had to look elsewhere
- first job in a hospital/emergency clinic, as a new grad; was placed on night duty (a whole week working only nights) from my 2nd week of work. Had a case which I was about to fail if I didn't call for help; decided that emergency was not for me, and I needed to get basic surgical experience; for some reason, the managers and senior doctors tried to negotiate with me to revert my resignation, I went forward with it anyway;
- second job in a general hospital; more sole charge, got to do surgery with little support. managers picking on every mistake like vultures. Then came an offer from an aquaintance to work in a shelter, took it.
- shelter seemed good. was promised loads of surgical time and support, barely any given. then found out that I was brought to repair a huge ""managerial"" mess, but the management sort of gave up on the idea, and I got not too much time, mostly because the managers could ""clean their mess properly"". I worked on medical side, apparently managers were happy with the results. 
- left for UK, as I was told that I could learn things faster in UK, and to a proper standard. Was warned about complaint prone culture and high stress, but I said I would give it a go.
- first job in UK, basically forced to resign, my colleagues didn't like me much, my clients hated me; 2nd job quit because I was tortured into depression by my ""mentor"". 3rd job mostly ok, I was becoming apathetic, as surgical time was non existent; pandemic struck, I was furloughed 4 months, got disconnected from being a doctor, tasted personal freedom, started doing things for my own, on my own, in my rhythm, started doing things I postponed for years 
- unfurloughed, moved to a new region in the same company, work with an indirect aquaintance as my boss. Started doing some mistakes (big) straight away, my boss (which promised to help, and knew of my academic achievements) started to look at me as a failure, and told me she has never seen  a medic so incompetent. I started questioning my entire knowledge and practical abilities. To this day I still do. And from that point, things got bad: I can't seem to think straight, and to take good decisions, I seem to move very slow; every phone ring spikes my anxiety. Every case that at some point seems to go right, immediately deteriorates, and I can't do too much to repair that mistake.  I am afraid of doing surgery. I am afraid, and partially hate doing the job I invested so much into.
I feel like I am trapped and that I have failed badly, as a professional and human being. I am full of guilt and shame for every client disappointed and every case that has not gone well. I feel that the only clean way out is to take the euthanasia drug and have a good dose injected in my vein. If I offer this kind way to address continuous suffering for my patients, why not be kind to myself that way ? I feel there are no other options left in sight, and that, compared withy colleagues, failed at life in general.

,depression,"I've been snorting Ritalin every day this week since last Saturday when a friend and I used a lot of MDMA, dexxies and Valium. I'm in a right state and I think I sent myself into a drug induced psychosis for the next couple of days.

This post is extremely long, and I don't expect anybody to read it, nor do I blame rhem. I almost feel like I'm writing in my own diary, but I need to get a monumental amount of shit off my chestI'm going through an insanely rough time and if i even get a single reply, that's enough. I don't usually ever lurk this sub or subscribe to /r/depression, as I'm not sure whether for someone like me, who suffers from perpetual mental illness and constant drug abuse, a sub like this would be good for me, although I think this sub reddit is probably a god send for a lot of people here who feel like nobody understands the struggles of mental illness, and feel like they don't have anyone to talk to about it, and this support group has probably has probably helped a lot of people around the world stay grounded and feel like whatever affliction they're currently experiencing, that they aren't alone, even though it often feels that way, especially when you're constantly trapped inside your head and feel like life is a never ending pit of chronic unhappily and misery. 

Most of you here probably feel like I do, and you yourself have no answer as to why you feel why you do, and even though you don't know why, and probably never will, you will never stop questioning it and everyday you question why you feel this indescribable feeling of sheer emptiness, self loathing, cynicism and cloud of existential dread and eternal misery. I am stubborn in my cynical personality and I do believe I will feel like this for the rest of my life, despite taking the right course of action and seeking help from my doctor and psychiatrist, and doing what I think will help me, but truly I think I've never changed.

I'm still as depressed and fucked in the head as I've ever been, and abusing drugs seems right at the time, and I feel okay for a while, but it's always temporary until I get my hands on another drug to abuse and escape my perpetual misery for a few hours. Drugs have been keeping me going for the better part of a decade now, and besides meth, heroin or alcohol, I'll abuse any drug I can get my hands on to feel anything but sober so I can escape this shitty existence and I feel like I'll continue to be this way if I can get away with it. Recently my long term girlfriend has reached the point of almost leaving me because my drug usage this year has been getting out of control.

I was addicted and a heavy daily weed smoker for about four years until I had a panic attack one night that lasted for several hours that left my body in agony for days following the attack. I kept smoking weed but it was never the same again. Every time after that I tried to smoke weed I'd have a panic attack no matter what. It took dozens of attempts to quit and I eventually got there. I've smoked a few times since then, and haven't had anything close to what I experienced that night, but I can't really enjoy it anymore, and I just became dumber, slower and less motivated and it consumed my life.

I discovered MDMA on new years ever coming into 2020 this year. This became my new drug of choice. The euphoria was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. Instantly I fell in love and I've probably taken MDMA 30-40+ times this year. Proper pure MDMA. I've basically already lost the magic, and have taken up to almost 2g of crystal MDMA in a 24 hour period. At that point your serotonin is completely drained, but I was still high, and had so much MDMA that I was hallucinating from the MDA that your body eventually gets from so much MDMA. The longest break I've taken this year is probably seven weeks away from it.

I buy it from someone who at one point in my life was my best friend. I've known him for around thirteen years now.We grew apart and now he just sells me ecstasy. It's a weird relationship. I feel like there's a weird subconscious acknowledgment that there is simply no friendship there now, and that's fine. I slightly think he's sociopathic, and he seems like a different person to the friend I once knew. I can't read him, and he seems like he has absolutely no moral compass. He doesn't even deal drugs as his full time job. He has his life together, a good paying full time job, a long term girlfriend, who I know he's cheated on about a dozen or more times. He talks about it like it means absolutely nothing and shows zero remorse, regrets or guilt for his actions, or for anything he does for that matter. She found out he cheated on her and she didn't have 100% concrete evidence, and he vehemently denied it, and she stayed with him. She knows deep down that he's cheated on her and fucked multiple other women. I'm unsure why she's stayed with him. He's openly incredibly racist, yet he's an insanely popular person, and people love to be around him, and has a huge social life. He's truly an enigma to me, and I still buy drugs off him. Deep down it took me years to get over the loss of our friendship, as he was my best friend, and after high school, six months went by before he finally decided to reply to my messsges. I already knew the friendship was over but I didn't want to believe it at the time. I truly grieved as if a family member had died. We text each other sometimes these days, non drug related conversations, and ""we'll hang out soon, we'll make it happen"". I know it won't happen. I'm a client to him, nothing more. It's a business exchange for product he's selling. It's weird though because whenever we talk in person he talks to me like nothing has changed, and our conversations almost feel like those that we had when we were close friends, except we're not anymore. It feels weird that he's so nice to me socially when we talk when I'm buying drugs off him, as if we were still best friends. The kind of conversations that feel like they could last for hours and hours, and everything flows so naturally, except the conversations only last a few minutes now. I often ponder what goes through his head. I can't tell whether he's a sociopath or just incredibly morally bankrupt. It surprises me knowing all this about him, yet he's a very well liked person, an ""alpha"" type male and yet everything about him has red flags everywhere. I know that other people know what he's like, but none of his current friends seem to care about how awful of a person he is. I'm constantly puzzled by it. I sometimes wonder if he's empty inside and he comes across as a bit of a thrill seeker who's always looking for something exciting and dangerous. He seems to live his life that way. He parties a lot, drinks heavily and does cocaine and occasionally uses MDMA himself, but he's not using it to the extent I am. He's seemingly able to abstain from all substances, and as far as I'm aware he's never actually been addicted to any particular drug, and appears to be able to just not use anything for long periods of time, unless he's having a huge bender. I'm surprised that he's never been addicted to any drug, and I don't know how he seeks so stable, being able to have a successful job, sell drugs, buy a house with his girlfriend and maitain such a reckless intense lifestyle. I sometimes feel like he's an unstoppable machine, and his family see none of this side of him, except maybe him being drunk I guess, as alcohol is legal and socially acceptable. 

2019/2020 have been the two lowest worst years in recent memory.  The place where I was working full time shut down so I was transferred to another store. I worked in the back of a retail store in the warehouse with one other guy. He was unhinged and made my working life very difficult. I think his divorce fucked him up permanently and his life was falling apart. He'd constantly call in sick, go on 1.5 hour lunch breaks to go home and get stoned, had a huge chip on his shoulder and was just not a good person to work alongside every day of the week. He'd constantly throw huge tantrums that the whole before could see/hear. I was constantly under pressure to do the work of two people. He was eventually fired. His replacement was even worse. He called in sick for almost six months on and off and I think I worked with him for a total of maybe six weeks. I was losing the plot, and my managers didn't give a fuck because I somehow manager to keep thing's afloat, despite being the only person in the warehousing for almost two years. I met my current girlfriend there and we were luckily both moved to the same store. My old store was five minutes from home. The new one was 30-40 minutes from home. I used to fill my car up once a fortnight. I now had to get petrol twice a week. Life got more expensive. I was incredibly anxious starting at another store with about 30 people I'd never met. 

Life got even worse. Once again, I was working alongside one other full-time person who was the head of the warehouse. A woman this time. She hated me from the very first day I started. She was currently going through a divorce, and my theory is she decided to take it out on me, although despite that, she was a genuinely psychotic individual who eventually lead to me resigning. Everything I did was wrong in her eyes. She didn't want to work alongside me as a team. She wanted to control me and mould me. She hated that I was taught how to do the job differently by somebody else. She made me sign ""company"" policies that weren't actually official policies, which I called her out on, so she would make threats of getting the managers to write me up on official warnings. She was spreading malicious lies about the store administered to me which I foolishly and naively believed and made me believe she was an awful person, and said I'd get in trouble if I didn't do things the way the admin was directing us to. At the time I had no reason to doubt her, in hindsight I felt fucking awful and guilty and eventually the admin and I figured out she was playing sick mind games pitting us against each other. I still feel guilty to this day because she made me hate her, even after apologising to her for believing her sick twisted lies.

She would constantly make threats of checking security footage to make sure rules were being followed and would often say she was going to the managers to get me into trouble if she found out I'd fucked up or made a mistake. She would intentionally write my name on pieces of work so managers would walk past and see it and question me on it. She would do the same if I was dealing with customer issues on our work computers which managers would constantly inquire about. There was no team work. If you started something, you finished it, even if you were off for two days on your weekend, she would refuse to help or even touch anything I'd started, because she didn't want to get herself involved in anything that could ever potentially leave a paper trail with her name on it. This meant that work wasn't getting completed at the rate it should. The job is literally team orientated and requires communication and cooperation to get the job done efficiently. 

The warehouse was absolute chaos and nothing made sense. To give context, it was tech retail. When I first started there, desktop computer monitors were randomly placed in five different aisles. I always tried to maintain a clean warehouse and tried to make sure every product (TV, fridge, computer etc) were all in designated areas, organised by brand and price. My first course of action was to condense all of the computer monitors into a single aisle out on display in racks on the shop floor to make it easier for the sales people. She lost her mind and demanded I bring them all back into the warehouse.

We had expensive laptops in the warehouse, and budget laptops at the front of the store on racks that required a ladder to get to which was in the busiest section of the store. It made no sense to have them in two different places. I brought all the budget laptops out to the warehouse and condensed and reorganised everything by brand, price and whether it was a gaming laptop, surface, or ultra book. She went straight to the managers to complain that I was ruining the warehouse and messing everything up. 

Truck drivers were constantly arriving to deliver stock, so they would press a button which would buzz to indicate we had deliveries. Often times I'd be down the back of the other end of the warehouse dealing with large TVs or fridges etc. She was constantly sitting at the computer wasting time making ""phone calls"" ""chasing things up"" and would ignore the truck drivers or blatantly get off her computer chair and conveniently walk off while I was in the middle of other work. I forever felt like I wasn't getting any work done. The work was literally piling up and our invoices were always behind schedules and I was constantly being questioned why I wasn't getting the work done by the managers. Every single day we could potentially receive 300-400 cartons of stock which had to be counted, and signed for before receiving to make sure we weren't missing anything. One truck alone could have 100 cartons of stock. Each individual carton had to be unopened, and could contain a dozen cameras, four drones, or fifty toasters tons single invoice, and all had to be individually priced and correctly tagged with the right product number. This was mostly left to me to do all of the stock processing because she was always ""too busy' on the computer wasting time and sucking up to the manager about how she'd ""fixed a customer issue"".

She would also legitimately sit in the office for 1-2 hours several days of the week going through security footage to find timelines of store theft. This was not a requirement of our job, and I would be left in the warehouse alone trying to get through hundreds of boxes of products, invoices and price them all up, all while dealing with truck drivers, customer calls, customer repairs, sending out online orders, taking customer orders to the counter and helping customers put TVs in their car. My store manager defender her using the security cameras to look for store theft as ""she is the head of stock, so it's her job to manage theft"" despite the fact that we literally had shopping centre police officers who dealt with thieves and it was their responsibility to grab security footage and try and arrest them. 

She would constantly tell every truck driver I was useless and that she was always trying to fix up mistakes. I'm entirely convinced she was literally making the job more complicated than it was to make her look like she'd done a lot of work, when in reality she was just wasting time and leaving me to fend for myself.

She would go on paid holiday leave, come back after her holidays and instead of a ""hey I'm back from my holiday"" it was ""the invoice list is fucking disgraceful"". Literally the first thing she said as she started back. This was around Christmas time when we had 3x the stock coming in so I couldn't keep up on my own and the warehouse was falling apart, customer repairs weren't getting sent out on time, stock wasn't getting put out fast enough, and I was always to blame. The only time she while process new stock was when the managers would receive emails from companies questioning why stock that came in a month ago hadn't been invoiced and paid. 

I'd had about half a dozen meetings with all three managers expressing my complaints, to the point where I really started to lose my cool and flew off the handle and started yelling and raging about how I was being treated. This was constantly swept under the rug. I was losing my mind. I ended up taking a week of stress leave. I was so close to snapping and I had to go home immediately one afternoon before I exploded in a fit of rage.

I worked with about 30-40 people. Everybody could see how bad it was, to the point that a couple of other staff expressed their concerns but nothing changed. She started to really get into my head, and I started doubting myself and was questioning if I was really bad at my job. She was winning and I knew it. I was losing my sanity and I'd go home everyday in a fit of rage and anger and my girlfriend essentially said ""if you don't resign, nothing will change and you're just going to get worse, you need to seek psychiatric help"". 

I'd been considering it for months, but it was a stable full time job, I was well liked, and the pay was decent. My whole life was this job and I made a lot of good friends there, despite this woman. I didn't want to leave but I was losing my sanity and I thought I was going crazy and she beat me. I ended up resigning before I had a full blown break down. 

Here's the icing on the cake no pun intended. All of my coworker got me a cake to say goodbye. Everybody knew why I was leaving. The psychotic cunt took a piece of my going away cake after her shift and fucked off without a word. I was truly disgusted at that point. It actually ruined what was already a shit day and she found away to make it worse. Fuck her. I'm still incredibly bitter and she legitimately fucked me up so bad mentally.

I was unemployed for several months, I lost my entire identity, and I hit rock bottom. I'm surprised my girlfriend is still with me. I was at home for several months unemployed, depressed, abusing drugs everyday and trying to keep myself from doing anything stupid.

I have a new full time job at another warehouse. A different company. I only work with around six people now. It's just as bad and I'm spiralling worse than ever. One of them is an ex meth head who's admitted he's an alcoholic currently, but apparently hates and judges whenever I've discussed MDMA use, another is obsessed with violence and gets into drunk fights on weekends, another is a 30 year old man child who sulks most of the day, and is a huge weeaboo who randomly says Japanese words mixed in with normal worse and constantly aays everything is ""cringe"", another is a mid 40s hardcore conspiracy theorist who thinks covid19 is fake, 5G is a weaopon, fluorine is bad and bill gates is giving kids autism. When I disagreed with him he verbally abused me and literally lost his mind at me and called me a ""cunt"" and a ""faggot cunt"" about 20-30 times.

Fuck me right? 

I'm thinking of buying some drug's today. I'm home alone all day and all I want to do is get fucked up and jerk off to porn like the sad fucked up cunt that I am. Nobody will read this essay of fucking shit anyway. I've been writing this for almost three hours and it's almost 5:00AM. I need to sleep. Hope you're all existing. That's all it is to me now.

Life story post below.,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jygbra,False,dark,1.0,,public,2,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,2,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1606013926.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been snorting Ritalin every day this week since last Saturday when a friend and I used a lot of MDMA, dexxies and Valium. I&amp;#39;m in a right state and I think I sent myself into a drug induced psychosis for the next couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is extremely long, and I don&amp;#39;t expect anybody to read it, nor do I blame rhem. I almost feel like I&amp;#39;m writing in my own diary, but I need to get a monumental amount of shit off my chestI&amp;#39;m going through an insanely rough time and if i even get a single reply, that&amp;#39;s enough. I don&amp;#39;t usually ever lurk this sub or subscribe to &lt;a href=""/r/depression""&gt;/r/depression&lt;/a&gt;, as I&amp;#39;m not sure whether for someone like me, who suffers from perpetual mental illness and constant drug abuse, a sub like this would be good for me, although I think this sub reddit is probably a god send for a lot of people here who feel like nobody understands the struggles of mental illness, and feel like they don&amp;#39;t have anyone to talk to about it, and this support group has probably has probably helped a lot of people around the world stay grounded and feel like whatever affliction they&amp;#39;re currently experiencing, that they aren&amp;#39;t alone, even though it often feels that way, especially when you&amp;#39;re constantly trapped inside your head and feel like life is a never ending pit of chronic unhappily and misery. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of you here probably feel like I do, and you yourself have no answer as to why you feel why you do, and even though you don&amp;#39;t know why, and probably never will, you will never stop questioning it and everyday you question why you feel this indescribable feeling of sheer emptiness, self loathing, cynicism and cloud of existential dread and eternal misery. I am stubborn in my cynical personality and I do believe I will feel like this for the rest of my life, despite taking the right course of action and seeking help from my doctor and psychiatrist, and doing what I think will help me, but truly I think I&amp;#39;ve never changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m still as depressed and fucked in the head as I&amp;#39;ve ever been, and abusing drugs seems right at the time, and I feel okay for a while, but it&amp;#39;s always temporary until I get my hands on another drug to abuse and escape my perpetual misery for a few hours. Drugs have been keeping me going for the better part of a decade now, and besides meth, heroin or alcohol, I&amp;#39;ll abuse any drug I can get my hands on to feel anything but sober so I can escape this shitty existence and I feel like I&amp;#39;ll continue to be this way if I can get away with it. Recently my long term girlfriend has reached the point of almost leaving me because my drug usage this year has been getting out of control.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was addicted and a heavy daily weed smoker for about four years until I had a panic attack one night that lasted for several hours that left my body in agony for days following the attack. I kept smoking weed but it was never the same again. Every time after that I tried to smoke weed I&amp;#39;d have a panic attack no matter what. It took dozens of attempts to quit and I eventually got there. I&amp;#39;ve smoked a few times since then, and haven&amp;#39;t had anything close to what I experienced that night, but I can&amp;#39;t really enjoy it anymore, and I just became dumber, slower and less motivated and it consumed my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I discovered MDMA on new years ever coming into 2020 this year. This became my new drug of choice. The euphoria was unlike anything I&amp;#39;d ever experienced. Instantly I fell in love and I&amp;#39;ve probably taken MDMA 30-40+ times this year. Proper pure MDMA. I&amp;#39;ve basically already lost the magic, and have taken up to almost 2g of crystal MDMA in a 24 hour period. At that point your serotonin is completely drained, but I was still high, and had so much MDMA that I was hallucinating from the MDA that your body eventually gets from so much MDMA. The longest break I&amp;#39;ve taken this year is probably seven weeks away from it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I buy it from someone who at one point in my life was my best friend. I&amp;#39;ve known him for around thirteen years now.We grew apart and now he just sells me ecstasy. It&amp;#39;s a weird relationship. I feel like there&amp;#39;s a weird subconscious acknowledgment that there is simply no friendship there now, and that&amp;#39;s fine. I slightly think he&amp;#39;s sociopathic, and he seems like a different person to the friend I once knew. I can&amp;#39;t read him, and he seems like he has absolutely no moral compass. He doesn&amp;#39;t even deal drugs as his full time job. He has his life together, a good paying full time job, a long term girlfriend, who I know he&amp;#39;s cheated on about a dozen or more times. He talks about it like it means absolutely nothing and shows zero remorse, regrets or guilt for his actions, or for anything he does for that matter. She found out he cheated on her and she didn&amp;#39;t have 100% concrete evidence, and he vehemently denied it, and she stayed with him. She knows deep down that he&amp;#39;s cheated on her and fucked multiple other women. I&amp;#39;m unsure why she&amp;#39;s stayed with him. He&amp;#39;s openly incredibly racist, yet he&amp;#39;s an insanely popular person, and people love to be around him, and has a huge social life. He&amp;#39;s truly an enigma to me, and I still buy drugs off him. Deep down it took me years to get over the loss of our friendship, as he was my best friend, and after high school, six months went by before he finally decided to reply to my messsges. I already knew the friendship was over but I didn&amp;#39;t want to believe it at the time. I truly grieved as if a family member had died. We text each other sometimes these days, non drug related conversations, and &amp;quot;we&amp;#39;ll hang out soon, we&amp;#39;ll make it happen&amp;quot;. I know it won&amp;#39;t happen. I&amp;#39;m a client to him, nothing more. It&amp;#39;s a business exchange for product he&amp;#39;s selling. It&amp;#39;s weird though because whenever we talk in person he talks to me like nothing has changed, and our conversations almost feel like those that we had when we were close friends, except we&amp;#39;re not anymore. It feels weird that he&amp;#39;s so nice to me socially when we talk when I&amp;#39;m buying drugs off him, as if we were still best friends. The kind of conversations that feel like they could last for hours and hours, and everything flows so naturally, except the conversations only last a few minutes now. I often ponder what goes through his head. I can&amp;#39;t tell whether he&amp;#39;s a sociopath or just incredibly morally bankrupt. It surprises me knowing all this about him, yet he&amp;#39;s a very well liked person, an &amp;quot;alpha&amp;quot; type male and yet everything about him has red flags everywhere. I know that other people know what he&amp;#39;s like, but none of his current friends seem to care about how awful of a person he is. I&amp;#39;m constantly puzzled by it. I sometimes wonder if he&amp;#39;s empty inside and he comes across as a bit of a thrill seeker who&amp;#39;s always looking for something exciting and dangerous. He seems to live his life that way. He parties a lot, drinks heavily and does cocaine and occasionally uses MDMA himself, but he&amp;#39;s not using it to the extent I am. He&amp;#39;s seemingly able to abstain from all substances, and as far as I&amp;#39;m aware he&amp;#39;s never actually been addicted to any particular drug, and appears to be able to just not use anything for long periods of time, unless he&amp;#39;s having a huge bender. I&amp;#39;m surprised that he&amp;#39;s never been addicted to any drug, and I don&amp;#39;t know how he seeks so stable, being able to have a successful job, sell drugs, buy a house with his girlfriend and maitain such a reckless intense lifestyle. I sometimes feel like he&amp;#39;s an unstoppable machine, and his family see none of this side of him, except maybe him being drunk I guess, as alcohol is legal and socially acceptable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2019/2020 have been the two lowest worst years in recent memory.  The place where I was working full time shut down so I was transferred to another store. I worked in the back of a retail store in the warehouse with one other guy. He was unhinged and made my working life very difficult. I think his divorce fucked him up permanently and his life was falling apart. He&amp;#39;d constantly call in sick, go on 1.5 hour lunch breaks to go home and get stoned, had a huge chip on his shoulder and was just not a good person to work alongside every day of the week. He&amp;#39;d constantly throw huge tantrums that the whole before could see/hear. I was constantly under pressure to do the work of two people. He was eventually fired. His replacement was even worse. He called in sick for almost six months on and off and I think I worked with him for a total of maybe six weeks. I was losing the plot, and my managers didn&amp;#39;t give a fuck because I somehow manager to keep thing&amp;#39;s afloat, despite being the only person in the warehousing for almost two years. I met my current girlfriend there and we were luckily both moved to the same store. My old store was five minutes from home. The new one was 30-40 minutes from home. I used to fill my car up once a fortnight. I now had to get petrol twice a week. Life got more expensive. I was incredibly anxious starting at another store with about 30 people I&amp;#39;d never met. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Life got even worse. Once again, I was working alongside one other full-time person who was the head of the warehouse. A woman this time. She hated me from the very first day I started. She was currently going through a divorce, and my theory is she decided to take it out on me, although despite that, she was a genuinely psychotic individual who eventually lead to me resigning. Everything I did was wrong in her eyes. She didn&amp;#39;t want to work alongside me as a team. She wanted to control me and mould me. She hated that I was taught how to do the job differently by somebody else. She made me sign &amp;quot;company&amp;quot; policies that weren&amp;#39;t actually official policies, which I called her out on, so she would make threats of getting the managers to write me up on official warnings. She was spreading malicious lies about the store administered to me which I foolishly and naively believed and made me believe she was an awful person, and said I&amp;#39;d get in trouble if I didn&amp;#39;t do things the way the admin was directing us to. At the time I had no reason to doubt her, in hindsight I felt fucking awful and guilty and eventually the admin and I figured out she was playing sick mind games pitting us against each other. I still feel guilty to this day because she made me hate her, even after apologising to her for believing her sick twisted lies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would constantly make threats of checking security footage to make sure rules were being followed and would often say she was going to the managers to get me into trouble if she found out I&amp;#39;d fucked up or made a mistake. She would intentionally write my name on pieces of work so managers would walk past and see it and question me on it. She would do the same if I was dealing with customer issues on our work computers which managers would constantly inquire about. There was no team work. If you started something, you finished it, even if you were off for two days on your weekend, she would refuse to help or even touch anything I&amp;#39;d started, because she didn&amp;#39;t want to get herself involved in anything that could ever potentially leave a paper trail with her name on it. This meant that work wasn&amp;#39;t getting completed at the rate it should. The job is literally team orientated and requires communication and cooperation to get the job done efficiently. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The warehouse was absolute chaos and nothing made sense. To give context, it was tech retail. When I first started there, desktop computer monitors were randomly placed in five different aisles. I always tried to maintain a clean warehouse and tried to make sure every product (TV, fridge, computer etc) were all in designated areas, organised by brand and price. My first course of action was to condense all of the computer monitors into a single aisle out on display in racks on the shop floor to make it easier for the sales people. She lost her mind and demanded I bring them all back into the warehouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had expensive laptops in the warehouse, and budget laptops at the front of the store on racks that required a ladder to get to which was in the busiest section of the store. It made no sense to have them in two different places. I brought all the budget laptops out to the warehouse and condensed and reorganised everything by brand, price and whether it was a gaming laptop, surface, or ultra book. She went straight to the managers to complain that I was ruining the warehouse and messing everything up. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truck drivers were constantly arriving to deliver stock, so they would press a button which would buzz to indicate we had deliveries. Often times I&amp;#39;d be down the back of the other end of the warehouse dealing with large TVs or fridges etc. She was constantly sitting at the computer wasting time making &amp;quot;phone calls&amp;quot; &amp;quot;chasing things up&amp;quot; and would ignore the truck drivers or blatantly get off her computer chair and conveniently walk off while I was in the middle of other work. I forever felt like I wasn&amp;#39;t getting any work done. The work was literally piling up and our invoices were always behind schedules and I was constantly being questioned why I wasn&amp;#39;t getting the work done by the managers. Every single day we could potentially receive 300-400 cartons of stock which had to be counted, and signed for before receiving to make sure we weren&amp;#39;t missing anything. One truck alone could have 100 cartons of stock. Each individual carton had to be unopened, and could contain a dozen cameras, four drones, or fifty toasters tons single invoice, and all had to be individually priced and correctly tagged with the right product number. This was mostly left to me to do all of the stock processing because she was always &amp;quot;too busy&amp;#39; on the computer wasting time and sucking up to the manager about how she&amp;#39;d &amp;quot;fixed a customer issue&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would also legitimately sit in the office for 1-2 hours several days of the week going through security footage to find timelines of store theft. This was not a requirement of our job, and I would be left in the warehouse alone trying to get through hundreds of boxes of products, invoices and price them all up, all while dealing with truck drivers, customer calls, customer repairs, sending out online orders, taking customer orders to the counter and helping customers put TVs in their car. My store manager defender her using the security cameras to look for store theft as &amp;quot;she is the head of stock, so it&amp;#39;s her job to manage theft&amp;quot; despite the fact that we literally had shopping centre police officers who dealt with thieves and it was their responsibility to grab security footage and try and arrest them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would constantly tell every truck driver I was useless and that she was always trying to fix up mistakes. I&amp;#39;m entirely convinced she was literally making the job more complicated than it was to make her look like she&amp;#39;d done a lot of work, when in reality she was just wasting time and leaving me to fend for myself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She would go on paid holiday leave, come back after her holidays and instead of a &amp;quot;hey I&amp;#39;m back from my holiday&amp;quot; it was &amp;quot;the invoice list is fucking disgraceful&amp;quot;. Literally the first thing she said as she started back. This was around Christmas time when we had 3x the stock coming in so I couldn&amp;#39;t keep up on my own and the warehouse was falling apart, customer repairs weren&amp;#39;t getting sent out on time, stock wasn&amp;#39;t getting put out fast enough, and I was always to blame. The only time she while process new stock was when the managers would receive emails from companies questioning why stock that came in a month ago hadn&amp;#39;t been invoiced and paid. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d had about half a dozen meetings with all three managers expressing my complaints, to the point where I really started to lose my cool and flew off the handle and started yelling and raging about how I was being treated. This was constantly swept under the rug. I was losing my mind. I ended up taking a week of stress leave. I was so close to snapping and I had to go home immediately one afternoon before I exploded in a fit of rage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked with about 30-40 people. Everybody could see how bad it was, to the point that a couple of other staff expressed their concerns but nothing changed. She started to really get into my head, and I started doubting myself and was questioning if I was really bad at my job. She was winning and I knew it. I was losing my sanity and I&amp;#39;d go home everyday in a fit of rage and anger and my girlfriend essentially said &amp;quot;if you don&amp;#39;t resign, nothing will change and you&amp;#39;re just going to get worse, you need to seek psychiatric help&amp;quot;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;d been considering it for months, but it was a stable full time job, I was well liked, and the pay was decent. My whole life was this job and I made a lot of good friends there, despite this woman. I didn&amp;#39;t want to leave but I was losing my sanity and I thought I was going crazy and she beat me. I ended up resigning before I had a full blown break down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#39;s the icing on the cake no pun intended. All of my coworker got me a cake to say goodbye. Everybody knew why I was leaving. The psychotic cunt took a piece of my going away cake after her shift and fucked off without a word. I was truly disgusted at that point. It actually ruined what was already a shit day and she found away to make it worse. Fuck her. I&amp;#39;m still incredibly bitter and she legitimately fucked me up so bad mentally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was unemployed for several months, I lost my entire identity, and I hit rock bottom. I&amp;#39;m surprised my girlfriend is still with me. I was at home for several months unemployed, depressed, abusing drugs everyday and trying to keep myself from doing anything stupid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have a new full time job at another warehouse. A different company. I only work with around six people now. It&amp;#39;s just as bad and I&amp;#39;m spiralling worse than ever. One of them is an ex meth head who&amp;#39;s admitted he&amp;#39;s an alcoholic currently, but apparently hates and judges whenever I&amp;#39;ve discussed MDMA use, another is obsessed with violence and gets into drunk fights on weekends, another is a 30 year old man child who sulks most of the day, and is a huge weeaboo who randomly says Japanese words mixed in with normal worse and constantly aays everything is &amp;quot;cringe&amp;quot;, another is a mid 40s hardcore conspiracy theorist who thinks covid19 is fake, 5G is a weaopon, fluorine is bad and bill gates is giving kids autism. When I disagreed with him he verbally abused me and literally lost his mind at me and called me a &amp;quot;cunt&amp;quot; and a &amp;quot;faggot cunt&amp;quot; about 20-30 times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fuck me right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m thinking of buying some drug&amp;#39;s today. I&amp;#39;m home alone all day and all I want to do is get fucked up and jerk off to porn like the sad fucked up cunt that I am. Nobody will read this essay of fucking shit anyway. I&amp;#39;ve been writing this for almost three hours and it&amp;#39;s almost 5:00AM. I need to sleep. Hope you&amp;#39;re all existing. That&amp;#39;s all it is to me now. I can already hear the magpies warbling and the sun is rising. If there is one thing I do truly love in life it&amp;#39;s birds. I have three pet budgies. They&amp;#39;re beautiful happy little creatures. They&amp;#39;ll probably be awake now too. At least they&amp;#39;ll keep me company today.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Last night, I made the decision to finally break off my 6 year relationship. 

I love him dearly as human, but I’m no longer in love with him. 

I was paying the rent and electric bill on my own, while he constantly changed jobs and quit them. 

We no longer slept in bed together. 

The affection slowly started to dwindle, besides occasional sex, which still wasn’t as often as I had wanted.

,depression,"Hi everyone. Yesterday, a friend from my college days reached out for help. We’re not close but he seems desperate to get some help. I listened to him over the phone for an hour and got a general idea of what is happening and what i might need to do.

I wanted to get some advice on how to find the right therapist. I also want to know how I can better help this friend.

Heres what i have gathered
- he claims he is depressed
- he is extremely paranoid
- he fears his parents are controlling him
- he seems to have difficulty reasoning his fears
- he says “when i go outside the buildings start waving at me” hallucinating? i think he is aware that these are not really happening
- he has met 5-6 different therapists but only found 1 good fit. but doesnt “trust” the therapist. be believes somehow his parents have made contact with the therapist and is controlling the therapist.

he says he would really benefit from therapist that ‘gets’ him.
- must speak mandarin 
- must understand chinese culture
- lady? in her 50’s
- must have no connection to his parents

I am just as confused as some of you folks reading this post. but my friend seems like he is in a really deep shit and I want to do my part and help out as much as i can.

If you know any therapist who fits the prerequisites, please DM me with a way to contact them.

Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, nothing ties me to life yet, but i guess like most of the people what prevents me from doing so is the people i love and love me.

So i just trapped in life i guess, or at least thats how i feel.

Is this depression? Should i treat this in therapy? (I mean the most ""serious"" one, i went to three psychologists in my life, i feel like none have helped) most of my life i felt ""on the edge of depression"", but maybe i always had it.

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, nothing ties me to life yet, but i guess like most of the people what prevents me from doing so is the people i love and love me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So i just trapped in life i guess, or at least thats how i feel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is this depression? Should i treat this in therapy? (I mean the most &amp;quot;serious&amp;quot; one, i went to three psychologists in my life, i feel like none have helped) most of my life i felt &amp;quot;on the edge of depression&amp;quot;, but maybe i always had it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks for reading, sorry for my english and i hope you can be better too.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I don't know if I am going to write a suicide note or just explain what I'm gonna do. Well, I can't stand to live anymore. I've been severely depressed for the past seven years. Psychologist didn't help me at all. Reaching out just gets forgotten about. I've just finished school and have no idea what the fuck I'm gonna do. These past couple days I've been getting major panic attacks where I can't breathe and I start tearing up. Sometimes I just want to smash every single thing in my room and punch holes in my walls and crash my car. I don't want to live through the consequences. When I'm driving to work I zone out and picture scenarios where I swerve off the bends and go tumbling down the cliff to my death. 

Nothing brings me comfort anymore, not even music. I've never had a girlfriend, never had sex, never had somebody love me back, I've never been truly happy for more than a day. There was a girl who I thought I might have had a chance with, but my best friend got drunk and started talking to her when he knew I was into her, taking all her attention away from me. I know I shouldn't be dwelling on it but I just am and I can't help it. She was the only person to let me know that she is there for me and is only a phone call away. Maybe I'm overthinking it or some other dogshit.... I overthink everything to the point where I make myself feel nauseous.

Does any one have any suggestions for the step before I start to climb out? Can anyone tell my why I should care? lol wow tough ask.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"**Backstory, can be skipped:**

Looking back as long as I can remember I was always depressed, sometimes more or less, with suicidal thoughts mixed in (which I never followed through, typical ""mom would be sad"" situation). Most things that I did were always because they were expected from me. And I did them well enough, I've never seriously failed at anything as far as I remember (school, jobs, university, new jobs, ..).

I did crack once under the pressure of my Bachelor's thesis, came out to my mom as depressed and went to a therapist (I had to, that was quite the close call). There I got anti-depressants (two kinds as the first didn't work so well). All that did was make me feel even less, no longer suicidal, but just empty. And I couldn't even get up to finish my thesis.

A few weeks later I stopped taking them, got some motivation back and powered through. Finished it, passed, finished university and off to work I went. A bit more content, sometimes even happy for a few days at a time. That was years ago, soon I'm going to be 30..

**Actual topic:**

As probably everyone I sometimes like to imagine to suddenly be rich. What would I do then? Quit my job, get a house and a nice car, play videogames all day, read more books, .. the usual things. But today no matter how hard I thought about it I couldn't think of a single thing I really would want to do. Not one.

Then my view suddenly shifted: What are things right now in my current situation which I can't do because I don't have the time or money for it? Anything?

And again I drew a blank.

I can't think of a single thing I want to do, or any goal that I have. Sure, with more freetime I'd spend more time gaming, watching movies and reading books, but that doesn't make one really happy (As I found out, had a full month off at the beginning of the pandemic and did absolutely nothing).

Compared to phases in my life back then I'm in a better place. Not sad or suicidal, but at the same time I feel empty and don't know what to do about it. Obviously I still do what's expected of me (mostly go to work), but that's it. When nobody expects anything from me (like on the weekend) I just lie around, eat too much and let the time pass.

Quit my job, get a house and a nice car, play videogames all day, read more books, .. the usual things. But today no matter how hard I thought about it I couldn&amp;#39;t think of a single thing I really would want to do. Not one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then my view suddenly shifted: What are things right now in my current situation which I can&amp;#39;t do because I don&amp;#39;t have the time or money for it? Anything?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And again I drew a blank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of a single thing I want to do, or any goal that I have. Sure, with more freetime I&amp;#39;d spend more time gaming, watching movies and reading books, but that doesn&amp;#39;t make one really happy (As I found out, had a full month off at the beginning of the pandemic and did absolutely nothing).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to phases in my life back then I&amp;#39;m in a better place. Not sad or suicidal, but at the same time I feel empty and don&amp;#39;t know what to do about it. Obviously I still do what&amp;#39;s expected of me (mostly go to work), but that&amp;#39;s it. When nobody expects anything from me (like on the weekend) I just lie around, eat too much and let the time pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Were you ever in the situation where you have nothing to strive for? Did you find a way out?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know what to do. I need some sleep and I need to keep my mind busy I guess. I need some positive feedback, energy, and vibes.&lt;/p&gt;

Depression is the random urge you feel to take a leap forward when you're waiting at the stoplight. But you know you can't.

Depression is covering your face with a peace symbol whenever you see the camera pointed at you because you're insecure but don't want people to know.

Depression is making jokes about killing yourself because it's funny.

Depression is realizing that you actually had a great time, and maybe you're not depressed. You feel a little fake and bad for those who actually can't get out of bed.

Depression is arriving home and realizing that you weren't faking it. 

Depression is really wanting to kill yourself although you just had a fun day with your friends.

&lt;p&gt;Depression is smiling when you see your friends and making them laugh. It makes you feel good. At least that&amp;#39;s what you tell yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is covering your face with a peace symbol whenever you see the camera pointed at you because you&amp;#39;re insecure but don&amp;#39;t want people to know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is making jokes about killing yourself because it&amp;#39;s funny.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is realizing that you actually had a great time, and maybe you&amp;#39;re not depressed. You feel a little fake and bad for those who actually can&amp;#39;t get out of bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is arriving home and realizing that you weren&amp;#39;t faking it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is really wanting to kill yourself although you just had a fun day with your friends. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is posting this on reddit, hoping that someone you know will see this and realize I&amp;#39;m struggling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depression is wanting to be cared for and understood.&lt;br/&gt;
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Edit: If any of my friends see this, I don&amp;#39;t want you blaming yourself. I really had a fun time :)&lt;/p&gt;

A few things about me: my childhood has been pretty traumatic. It's very complicated so I'll sum it up with mental and physical abuse from my family and other people I've cared about and trusted. It hasn't always their intention to hurt me and I know I'm loved but intentions and love don't really matter because it still has hurt me very deeply. I've been trying to deal with it but there's always something new that happens, I can never get a fucking break from life and it has been like that almost my whole life.

Some other things that might be relevant is that I've been dealing with anxiety my whole life, I had my first panic attack when I was 3 or 4, I've been sexually assaulted too many times to count. I was 2 or 3 the first time and now I hate my body, especially everything that can be viewed as ""sexy"". 

I have been to numerous therapists and all that but it just doesn't help. I have tried everything they've told me to do, exercise, eat clean, get fresh air, sleep... You probably know what I'm talking about. Nothing helps, and yes I've done it long term not just a day or two. It never gets better, just worse. Sure sometimes it has been easier but we're talking about a month tops. This has literally been my whole life and it has just gotten worse over the years. I have been suicidal on and off since I was 10, I'm 18 now. I failed at killing myself a few weeks ago and I went to the hospital with an ambulance. My current therapist got the news but when we talked about it she just kept misunderstanding me or brushing things off. She does not understand me and no one ever fucking does. I'm so frustrated and I don't know what to do. All I ever get is pity, misunderstanding or dumb advice that doesn't work for me. I want to get better but at the same time I see no reason to, life sucks. It always has and it always will. My future consists of going to school, working, retiring and dying if I even make it that long. Some short moments of happiness in exchange for a lifetime of suffering. I do not see the point.

I have friends, I know I'm loved, I know that I'd hurt a lot of people very deeply if I kill myself but I can't keep going like this forever and nothing I've tried has been working long term. I really don't want to hurt anyone but I'm out of options at this point, my mental illnesses physically hurt, I have no motivation or energy to do anything. Everything gives me anxiety or requires a lot of energy and determination to do, drinking water, eating, even just going to the fucking toilet to pee. If anyone has read this far I'm sorry for the confusing ass text.

What blows my mind is people will say ""tRy mOrE tHiNgS"" . Na thats the whole fucking point, is that it doesn't matter what I do im bored. Sure I can distracted myself for awhile doing some things but its all so boring. Therefore there is no desire for external things in life. Therefore  I am what society calls a failure.

,depression,"Long story short if you do not want to read it all and if you read title:

1. I've never been hugged for real in all my 16 years (Mother do not count, and i start avoiding it and completly block all physical contact)
2. My longest ""realtionship"" were 1 hour
3. All people that i talked to - ALWAYS, no matter what, lying to me and disappearing.
4. I do not feel attraction to human body at all, but still want have relationship even if i know that's impossible with my temper.

If you want to read full post, here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, i do not want to reveal my name or so, only what i can say about my identity that i hate - i am 16 years old, live in russia (no stereotypes). Tou already can say its only hormones, but i think they do like \~5% of that

I would like to write all stories in order from title.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **No Physical Contacts (real ones)**

That's true, i've never been hugged or kissed (for real) in my life. I know that's okay and can happen, but anyway it feel like everyone avoiding contact with me.""For real"" - means that i've never been hugged or kissed with some emotions, all what i got is fake hug everytime when i go home and see off my schoolmate, and even then i know it was fake and she did it because she abuse me for her profit. How i knew it? Well, she find herself a boyfriend and still call me walk with them. No, it was fun, but when she broke up with him, she just asked her mother for 10k ""moral compensation"", and he got to hospital because of drugs (i need that detail later)

Also i have gratueted from school (now completly isolate my self from socium), like everyone, where i was bullied hard. They took my money, they punch me sometimes for fun, swearing of course, and so on. That continues before 9th grade, when we all suddenly team up to close this exams. It was good to, no problem, but first 8 years was NOT that good.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **""No"" relationships**

You can say that i am lying, because i've also say i've been in rs for 1 freaking hour. But i can't say it was rs at all. Like lol, we met up, go through shop, buy snacks, sit on concrete (my favorite place, hard to explain, imagine this like bench, but it square shaped) AND THEN HER BOYFRIEND APPEARED AND TOOK HER AWAY! I DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT HIM! She was not the same girl from #1, but also about her...

Dec 31. 2017 as i remember (yes, 12 years old) i typed her that i love and i want at least to try, FUCKING TRY, experience relationship and know what it is, but no, she blocked me, resend it to all my class and laugh at me.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **No friends/people to talk with at all, and can't talk without feel that you ruin they're mood.**

Everytime i say something about me, i try to lie and avoid it, because i do not want to ruin that funny mood and give saddness to people. Even this account, i think, need to be deleted after this post, to no one more saw this. No matter is that person my mom, friend (at the time), psychotherapist, that's my problem and only i need to find solution (self-contradiction, but yes.)

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Work like psychotherapist.**

Also a problem, because i have my problems, and i (without realizing or paying attention) help people to take they're problems away. I know about hitchhiker's syndrome, when you can say anything that bother you to unknown people, that's why i can type it all here, but still when you hear it all about someone being raped, someone have family cult (me too, lol), and in main time have problems with communicate or with understanding people... Oof. So many people just randomly find me in twitter or VK or so and our dialog goes to problems and bad stories, but ok, i do not mind it, type all your problems, i can answer and help, but please, **PLEASE,** can you NOT IGNORE and NOT THROW me to blocked list after you do that? I have so many stories... No, all people say that one thing:- You are wonderful person! Thank you for help! I really want to become like you and help other people!...

What do you think?

\- Stop message me, nerdor

\-Yea, yea, i am just busy, can you wait?  
\*after 2 months\*  
\- I AM SORRY PLS I STILL LIKE YOU OF COURSE I AM NOT LYING!  
\*completly wiped\*

I just do not understand, why can you say in my face that one phrase: ""Thank you for help, good luck in life"" and then leave, why you need to be rude?  
Because of that, now i can't normally talk and go to chats, even furry ones, i just can't say ""How's been your day?"" cuz they already talk on they're wave, about they're themes and about they're interest... They do not interest in me or what i can say and i just leave

And also in this section i can notice that for past 1,5 year i really, **really,** jump into ""dark"" telegram channels about pedophiels, gore and so, even if i ready to vomit. idk why, but that a thing for me (i am not a pedophile, i hate gore)

Okay, in conclussion: **I Maybe have depression.** or its selfblock, idk, but i want to see if here someone like me.

If you want to advise me, PLEASE, I BEG YOU, can you not write typical ones? Like try to sleep, workout, healthy food. I just do not want to hurt anyone and not be aggresive to someone here.

I fell in love with my best friend and I told her I fucking hate her and now she hates me too and I can't take it back because it really sounded like I meant it but it doesn't go away so now I just feel all the time but I can't even talk to her because I told her I hate her and I can't take it back because if I just tell her I'm fucking crazy why the fuck would she talk to me again I'm fucking crazy I'll probably do it again and she trusted me and said she loves me more than anyone and I told her I hate her

nobody wants to listen to you man they think ""oh he's just fucking crazy he needs to talk to somebody"" but who do you talk to when everyone thinks you're fucking insane and nothing you say and nothing you do can change it and even if they insist they don't think you're completely fucking batshit you know they're lying you can fucking tell in the way they act and the way they say it and as soon as you're done talking, I suppose when they realize, they run away as fast as they can. and who can blame them? I certainly can't, I derive no enjoyment from talking to crazy people and I know nobody feels especially good talking to me I think they just don't want me to kill myself because society taught them it's a bad thing but secretly they know the world would be slightly better with one less nutty fucking lunatic on earth man I'm a fucking pest to them they want me gone and they won't say it ma I can fucking feel it

,depression,"I dont even know what to say. I dont know what I am feeling. I don't even know if I am feeling right now.

Im fucking 17 and I have my whole life ahead of me but everything just feels like shit and I dont know where to start.

College apps just reminded me that soon everything is gonna change and I dont fucking want that. I'm more than qualified for most schools, but I'm still stressed about getting in and what will happen when I go. Right now I dont even want to go to college and I dont want to work either. Whats the point. What the fuck is the point of life why am I here. FUCK. 

I already work and I fucking hate it. I literally just get there and zone out. Same with school. I just don't have the ability to focus like I used to. I'm still getting all As, I just don't know how.

Because of covid I have lost almost all of my friends except 1. And I don't want to be just friends with her. And apparently she felt the same way about me. But she has a boyfriend now. I wish I had fucking known though. How could I not have. We met on a church trip and due to lucky circumstances we didn't have an adult leader on the top of the boat for our group, so we ended up staying up late. 2 days in she fell asleep on my lap after she saw a shooting star for the first time in her life. On night 3 we were playing truth or dare, and I just found out in the same conversation where I found out she liked me that she told the guy that dared me to kiss her to give me that dare. She stole like 3 of my hoodies and I just thought it was normal. She made me sit next to her on the bus ride home and we talked for 4 ficking hours. She forced me to go to my own schools homecoming with her even though I didn't want to go cause it was 30 minutes after a football game I had to play in (and our school sucks). How the fuck could I not know she liked me. But now I've had to listen to her talk about how her boyfriend (she's 16 im 17 he just turned 18 and is built like the fucking hulk) almost got her pregnant twice. You know how much that shit hurts. And now she isn't talking to me as much as she had been recently and I dont know why And it fucking sucks. 

The only time I feel anything other than dread and the urge to cry even though I know I can't is when I see a notification from her. When I see it I always smile and something in my stomach just feels good and I have just a wave of happy roll though me. But now that she isn't talking to me as much it has just made everything so much worse and I just can't bring myself to do anything. 

I just don't want to fucking live anymore, I hate the present and fear the future and literally the only reason that I haven't ended it yet is cause when she was depressed I told her that if she killed herself I will too, and she told me she would do the same and I dont want that. 

I know sleep will help but I have been going to bed earlier and earlier every night and I still stay up till like 3-4 am just wishing I could cry or just express some sort of emotion.

I just want to end it, and I really wish I could but I just can't bring myself to it. I'm trying to give myself every chance I can... I'm keeping a knife collection, and I purposely bought a car without airbags and seat belts I know won't work (door mounted ftw) just so I have a chance, but I dont have to do it to myself.  

I dont even know what to say, it just felt good to get that off my chest, cause I know I can't tell anyone I know about this. Thanks for reading, and im sorry if it sucked. I'm sitting in my (parked)car on mobile so it isnt easy to type well.

,depression,"I don't feel like typing out everything, but I'll probably update later on. I have CPTSD. I'm sad. I think my boyfriend is manipulative and doesn't realize it, and I don't know what to do. My first ever pet rat is very old (3) and I think a lot about if he's going to make it to Christmas or not, and I just want to cry. I have a twin sister and I love her so very much, but we dont talk as much because she's at college, and doesn't have a lot of time to talk. I don't want to think about visiting my parental units and brother for the holidays because they suck, but I also don't want to not go because my sister will be there, and she'll want to see me obviously. I don't feel like I have to, because my grandparents aren't visiting this year because of COVID. I put on a whole bunch of weight after maintaining an 85 pound weight loss for two years. All of it. All of it went back on because I was depressed and binge eating everyday to cope. I was struggling with family issues, and I still am. They weren't good people growing up, and honestly don't ever want to see my dad again. My boyfriend makes me feel guilty about it because he doesn't have a dad but he also has a ""fuck your family"" kind of attitude. Which, I do too. They did a lot of things when I was a kid that made me never want to see them again, but I feel so broken and torn about it. I don't know if I love my dad, I don't think I do. I feel guilty when I don't see them, or talk to them. I'm just so hurt. My boyfriend quit his job and has been trying to find a new one with no luck, so I started working more to make up for the lack thereof, and I can pay rent this month, and next until he has a job. We just might have world's smallest Christmas, which, I mean, it's okay. I love him, and he loves me (or so he says. I have my doubts) and all I really care about is having a good time, and one holiday where nobody yells at each other AT ALL. I've never had one holiday where there wasn't any arguing or yelling at us or anything, so I have some low hopes for this year, but I'm not expecting much. My boyfriend has bad trust issues(that's a whole story) and I feel like he uses that against me sometimes, but we've lived together for a full year, and have spent nearly everyday together except when we were working. He thinks I'm cheating on him, and will accuse me of such, when I have no intention to whatsoever. When we first started dating, I was open and honest and shared many things relating to my past relationships. I've cheated on every guy I've been with in the past but only because 1. I wanted to break up with them. and 2. It had been a month or two and I wasn't feeling it, and was going to break up with them. Usually when I did cheat, the break up would be the following day. We've been together for a minute, and I'm not the person I used to be anymore. All I've been is honest from the beginning. Recently, I've felt like cutting myself, which I haven't self-harmed since I was in 8th grade. I've also felt like going back to my bulimia. Every time I drive, I just think about hitting a guard rail at full speed or getting in a major car accident, almost like those things are just waiting to happen. I'm really stressed out, but have been managing that to the best of my ability. I want to get high, and do coke. I feel like I'm not as smart anymore. I used to be so bright and so good at school work, and I'm really intelligent. My brain just feels BLAH and it's scary to me because my mind is important to me, but also the worst part about me. It's like my brain is one big grey area. I want to go back to school, but I don't have any money to. Everyone in my apartment complex has hardwood floors and nice kitchens and we have carpet from the 70's and an old af kitchen, but we all pay the same price (to my knowledge).

ugh. I'm so sad thinking about my rat boy. I love him so so so much. I'm just waiting for the day when he's no longer. I check him for tumors everyday, and keep an eye on his movement. He's slowed down a lot because of age, and if he was hurting, I wouldn't quite know because rats can hide it really well. He almost passed away. He was acting funny, and it looked like he was breathing really really hard. I took him to the vet and he had a respiratory infection. If I hadn't done so, he probably wouldn't have made it out because of his age. I just want my rat boy to live forever.

,depression,"Depression is different than being depressed. But unless you have depression, it's hard to understand how it can't be caused by something, aka being depressed.

Inevitably, you'll have to explain depression vs being depressed and I thought I'd share a recent analogy that seemed to resonate.

*Analogy*


Imagine that you have a normal day, or even a great day. It doesn't matter, because in the morning, you wake up 100lbs heavier. 

What's even weirder is that you're the only one that sees the weight, but it still affects you physically. You look at the mirror and you look fine, but you can see it when looking directly at your new chub.

It's harder to move around, and harder to breathe--youre tired.

None of your clothes look right so you just go with the simplest thing. You're so shocked at your physical change that basic hygiene and appearance just seem pointless. (Can't explain how you can wear the same stuff).

You're self conscious of your weight and unkept appearance, so you avoid people.

You don't really feel like eating because you just gained 100lbs overnight, you're lethargic. Ok, you might sneak some food but just the minimum to not feel sick and it was purely a chore...a hard chore.

Then, you may even say 'fk it' and order a cake or tub of ice cream for food. Sugar rush feels a bit better, for a minute.

Your whole sense of self has been shook. You tell yourself that this is just depression kicking in, and you know it and can prove it, but that realization doesn't matter. 

You start questioning the validity of your most dear relationships--do they even like you? Do they even love you?

You question your sense of meaning, of life.

&lt;p&gt;Your whole sense of self has been shook. You tell yourself that this is just depression kicking in, and you know it and can prove it, but that realization doesn&amp;#39;t matter. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You start questioning the validity of your most dear relationships--do they even like you? Do they even love you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You question your sense of meaning, of life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing really matters that much.&lt;/p&gt;

When I was a kid it was because I was in an abusive home but as I got older and even now as I live independently, I genuinely believe that anyone smart would be depressed considering the current state of the world. 

Even when I was suicidal and attempted to end my life, I didn’t want to actually die. That concept was terrifying to me and still is. The fact that I got so close to dying is the reason I won’t try again. I want to live. I have several dreams and aspirations, reasons to live. But I just know that I will NEVER be happy in the world we live in now. I’ll never have the time or energy to create, learn and explore the things that make me happy. The pain of existence in this society is so unbearable some days I feel like I could explode, other days I completely shut down and can’t even think or move. Even outside of my minuscule personal shit there is so much suffering in this world currently and in the past. It hurts to know what humans are capable of. The future looks darker every day. 

I’m trying to be healthier and not self destruct or ruin my life like I have in the past and all that has helped me lately is literally just getting lost in my thoughts and daydreams. I want to hurt myself so bad and this is all I can do to stop myself. Even at work, i’m physically there but doing everything possible to disconnect from where I am and make up games and scenario is in my head to make it bearable. I still have intrusive thoughts about ending my life at work every single day. Especially since all my coworkers complain about how slow I am and how I never pull my own weight. I can’t even tell them how I really feel because it would probably get me fired since I work in the medical field. 

What could I even say? It takes every ounce of energy just to get out of bed, I’m so irritable and resentful towards everything and everyone. sometimes I’m slow because I had to shut down so I wouldn’t blow up, cry or do something drastic. Sometimes I hide in the bathroom because I get so overwhelmed with negativity. But I got in trouble for that so I can’t even do that...

As this whole thing has progressed I’ve basically gotten to a place where I feel like a literal child and just cry all the time and want to be held and comforted. The only thing that makes me feel slightly better is acting like a child, buying cute toys and trying to disconnect from the current reality. Childhood is the only part of my life I feel like was me.

I’m currently living in the UK which is currently going through its second lockdown, recently have just been let go from my job and had a really difficult breakup which has forced me to move back home. On top of this I now need £43,500 to study a Masters in Finance Analysis at LBS which I’ve been planning to do for years. 

I have a plan in place to get my life back on track. For example; I’ve set up a company with a friend from university; revising for exams to get get scholarships for the masters I’ve mentioned above, and been really getting into my running of late. 

However, I’m feeling that I’m losing interest in everything. I’m not enjoying spending time at home with my family, not even wanting to try and get back on the dating scene or speak to my friends and struggling to get out of bed in the mornings.

I feel that a combination of not being able to do activities during lockdown, my destruction of my previous relationship and losing my job might have contributed to that.

,depression,"I’m struggling with a lot of anxiety these days, I have constantly been home since march and I started working (WFH) post my graduation this year. But I don’t feel like doing anything, I’m lying on my bed and not doing anything the whole day almost everyday, I cry very very easily, I sorta also feel lonely because I don’t really think I have anyone that close to talk to. My parents don’t think mental health is a real issue so it’s kinda hard for me to know what to do now. One of the major concerns I’ve is I feel palpitations in my chest and feel anxiety almost everyday from as soon as I wake up. And I have so much decision making anxiety and I constantly feel I never take the right decisions. I also feel like a semi failure, like I want to change the job I’m working in, just don’t like it here and have a few applications in mind where I want to apply but for that, I need to study first because I legit haven’t done any studies since almost the past year so I don’t think I’m fit to interview at this state and so I want to be prepared first because I’ve constantly failed at a couple of interviews in the past year and don’t want to fail again because I feel I’ll just get more triggered then. I also feel like I constantly undermine myself as in I look at something and I make up my mind that I’m certain that I wouldn’t be able to clear/crack it. (I used to be an extremely studious student in school and was really fairly hardworking in college too but then with time, with certain things or maybe I myself kept pulling myself down and now I just feel I’m not good enough). I really really at times want to work hard and get that job but then all I do is procrastinate and sleep and think that it’s impossible I’ll be able to do it. (Even though I know that if I give a 100% I might be able too???idk). It also seems so tough for me to get myself to do small small tasks such as having a bath everyday, my bed is always a mess. I have basically literally spent 95% of the time since march lying on my bed. I don’t have any hobbies, I don’t think there’s anything I love doing. I’m super sad almost all the time :( I also feel some of these issues are maybe because I have some unresolved trauma from the past but I have no idea what to do about it ?!???

I used to have some of these issues in college too I guess but then there were classes and I used to go out with my friends a lot so I wasn’t left with a lot of time.

But I don’t feel like doing anything, I’m lying on my bed and not doing anything the whole day almost everyday, I cry very very easily, I sorta also feel lonely because I don’t really think I have anyone that close to talk to. My parents don’t think mental health is a real issue so it’s kinda hard for me to know what to do now. One of the major concerns I’ve is I feel palpitations in my chest and feel anxiety almost everyday from as soon as I wake up. And I have so much decision making anxiety and I constantly feel I never take the right decisions. I also feel like a semi failure, like I want to change the job I’m working in, just don’t like it here and have a few applications in mind where I want to apply but for that, I need to study first because I legit haven’t done any studies since almost the past year so I don’t think I’m fit to interview at this state and so I want to be prepared first because I’ve constantly failed at a couple of interviews in the past year and don’t want to fail again because I feel I’ll just get more triggered then. I also feel like I constantly undermine myself as in I look at something and I make up my mind that I’m certain that I wouldn’t be able to clear/crack it. (I used to be an extremely studious student in school and was really fairly hardworking in college too but then with time, with certain things or maybe I myself kept pulling myself down and now I just feel I’m not good enough). I really really at times want to work hard and get that job but then all I do is procrastinate and sleep and think that it’s impossible I’ll be able to do it. (Even though I know that if I give a 100% I might be able too???idk). It also seems so tough for me to get myself to do small small tasks such as having a bath everyday, my bed is always a mess. I have basically literally spent 95% of the time since march lying on my bed. I don’t have any hobbies, I don’t think there’s anything I love doing. I’m super sad almost all the time :( I also feel some of these issues are maybe because I have some unresolved trauma from the past but I have no idea what to do about it ?!???&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to have some of these issues in college too I guess but then there were classes and I used to go out with my friends a lot so I wasn’t left with a lot of time. But now since the pandemic, I haven’t gone out at all, just at home overthinking about everything and this anxiety is really triggering me now. &lt;/p&gt;

Said i dont get it, what wrong and why cant he fight

Said i dont care its his problem and he was born like that

Said a few jokes that I now regret

But I see it in me and i’ve become the joke

&lt;p&gt;Whose laugh sounded like its been a while since he had one&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whose eyes seemed empty &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whose conversations felt random, confusing and weird&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I remember that kid and i remember me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said i’ll never get him and whats going on in his mind&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said i dont get it, what wrong and why cant he fight&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said i dont care its his problem and he was born like that&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Said a few jokes that I now regret&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now I see those empty eyes, and hear that awkward laugh, and that shaking voice which utters words at random&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I see it in me and i’ve become the joke
And once I got here it felt like it’s going to last forever&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always wanted to be funny, to make people laugh, and so i became&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now they laugh&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now I’m funny&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess I should be thankful i got what i wanted&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I now know you felt it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know you saw it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You knew you were a joke
..........&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you, the girl who cut herself, today was the first time i felt the need to do the same
And im sorry I didn’t get it

There, I said it. It's not the first, nor the last time I'll say it, and the feeling of hurt, sadness, and longing still remains as if it was the first time I said it. 
I know you don't like when I say it. I know you want me to be happy, and  be satisfied with my life, want me to move on, find someone else, be happy with myself.
I have tried. I tried so hard, so many times, I try to go up that ladder, seeing you up there, happy and comfortable, and then, i slip, and that small distance, becomes so big I can barely see you, and I tried to go up again, always ending with me falling, deeper each time. 

I am sorry. I am sorry I annoyed you so much, with texts, pictures, trying to hold on to that small thread we still had. I am sorry I annoyed you. I was the only one still trying to bring something that didn't exist anymore, and trying to make it whole again. 

I am not happy, not with myself nor with my life. Ive fucked up multiple times, and I find myself in a hole so deep, with no ladder, and almost with no light. I want to give up, want to throw it all away, but I cant find the courage yet, and if i do, I hope you wont hear about it, I hope you remain happy, I hope you grow more and more, fly higher and higher to your bright bright future, because you deserve it. 

I used to write stories to you, write poems about you, about us, about everything, and now, I can barely wrote anything anymore, my mind doesn't want to think, my hands dont want to write, I just cant do anything right anymore. 

I know. Its been so long, almost two years, and still, you live in my heart. Ive tried kicking you out, but you still come back, my memories of you come back, my memories of us, of everything, and it hurts, it hurts all the time. 

You know, I wish we could talk, I wish I could tell you how great my life is being, how great College is going, how many friends I made, how im writing, how I am good. But im not, College is going horribly, I haven't made any friends, I actually lost a lot of them. I am not ok. I have no energy anymore.

I have divorced parents who I can’t seem to make happy even though I’ve never been to jail, I’ve never been addicted to substances, I’ve made a somewhat decent living for myself an honest living. I’ve done nothing but good in my life, sure I’ve broken a few hearts here and there but nothing that’s been done to me. I just feel like whatever I do whatever decision I make in life it’s always going to be the wrong decision. I just wanna find that ultimate guidance but I know I’ll never find it. It leads me to a very uncertain future. A future that ends in only one way and it’s bad, I knows it’s not the right decision but fuck what can someone do. You have an individual that’s made a decent life, never gotten into any serious trouble isn’t a bad person but yet always constantly feels he/she is always fucking up. The only way I see things getting better is to fucking call it a day and end it. I want to end it I want to stop this suffering this bullshit that I feel like I’m constantly letting others down. I’ve tried my best but I guess my best isn’t good enough.&lt;/p&gt;

So I started hanging with my buddies who party and they have a party house that is everything you want, karaoke, a casino room, a coke dealer who lived there, and girls. For about 7 weekends straight I would drink shots of vodka, chain smoke, do a few gs of cocaine, and pop trazodone to go to sleep.

It was like the sweetest nightmare with really high highs, and very very low hangover comedown days so dark that I thought of ending my life because I felt like I failed myself. Then something devastating happened, it was my birthday and I woke up to the news my good buddy Zach overdosed on heroin. I immediately started to cry and told myself I can't go on this way. Later that week I went to his funeral, and it was the saddest thing watching his parents and two kids having to say goodbye, I promised myself I wouldn't do that to my family and that I would be a recovery advocate from then on.

I got help, therapy read books, and got back into my fitness and health routine. And I also got back to my passion for music.  I am a singer/rapper similar to like Eminem or nf people say. I put my heart into my songs. I ended up making a very deep song where I came clean about everything that had been going on, and I released the music video on youtube. And it now has over 40k views with no label or help.

Then the Facebook version has 50k as well as over 800 shares and comments of people telling me they felt every word of my song and how they can relate. I have been humbled by the response.

It releases tonight on all digital music streaming services and I'm feeling a bit emotional. So I felt I would share with my fellow addicts. If you wanna listen to it google search Stylez Major -Lost in a High.

I’ve been a lot more irritable, moody and tired since then. That in combination with people generally being assholes in the world, I stopped going out much unless is absolutely necessary. I’m starting to treat my online life the same way. I used to wake up in the morning ready to take on the day, had a good philosophy about life, now I wake up numb and go to bed numb. Its seems like every time a spark goodness happens it’s immediately shot down by something extremely negative. 

I honestly believe I’m cursed. I don’t trust good things in life anymore. Its funny to say but I’m highly suspicious of something genuinely good happening to me because I’m wondering when it will all be taken away. Theres so much crap that happened to me in the last 3 years, you’d think I pissed off a witch or something. I lost 3 years of my life, literally because I don’t remember much other than the bad stuff that happened and because I was too busy trying heal instead of live.

I can’t remember anything, especially not material from a book. I used to enjoy reading books but now my mind wonders too much, unable to grasp what I’m reading, causing me to read a sentence over and over again. Its honestly frustrating.

,depression,"So, using a throwaway because I'd rather this wasn't on my main account, looking for some advise.

I'm mostly post treatment these days. My day to day experience is generally more neurotypical than not as long as I keep up with my CBT exercises and things. I've spent the last couple of years building out my support networks so when I do have an episode I have people I can rely on.

But now I feel like I'm stuck, and after some self reflection I think I know why; there is still a decent chunk of my mind that still thinks that eventually I'm going to kill myself, so what's the point in planning for the future.

To be clear, I don't experience ideation anymore, I don't have active suicidal thoughts at all, really, but I'm starting to think that this is the subconscious roadblock that is getting in the way.

I know that I need to sort out my driving license, but a part of me is worried the freedom that brings will make it easier to kill myself in the future. 

I know that I want to seek out new romantic relationships, but a part of me is worried that the stress of doing that will push me closer to wanting to end things.

I think I know, generally, what I want to do with my life career wise, but I struggle with knowing that there is a decent chance any effort I put in to make headway will be spoilt by a moment of weakness and a short fall.

,depression,"I know I’m a very privileged person and very lucky to have what I have, but for the sake of this post, I’m about to wallow in self-pity and despair because my depression is truly blinding me of the good things in life right now.

I’m 31. I quit my job in January to (finally!) fulfill my dream of becoming a self-employed artist. All was well until March. It’s been a nightmare. I’ve lost so many clients. Missed every deadline. Disappointed many. I realized I hate making art as a job. But it was my dream for 20 years to be an artist. I’m now unemployed and completely lost as to what I should/want to do next.

My relationship of 3 years just ended. It was tough- we both suffer from mental illnesses and just couldn’t seem to break this cycle we had created. We had an 2 surprise pregnancies and 2 losses in the last 4 months. It was so f*cking bard but I was proud of us for getting through it together. It helped us grow closer for a little while and things were feeling better but now everything has completely fallen apart. Losing him also means losing my relationship with his son, who I love so much.

My “best” friend also dropped off the face of the earth around that time. Everything was completely fine with us and then one day she just stopped talking to me. It was a bit of a toxic friendship so I know it’s good that it ended but she was also the only person I could talk to about everything that was happening. She was the only one who listened and understood and was non-judgmental.

I can’t fly home to see my family for the holidays because of COVID. Since my partner and I just broke up, I guess that means I’m now completely alone for Christmas. 

To sum up, I literally feel like I’ve lost absolutely everything in the last few months. I have no idea what to do. I’m lucky to have a roof over my head and 3 sweet cats to cuddle but I can’t stop thinking of the fact that everything else I cared about or wanted is now....over.

,depression,"I am a Christian but i don’t think there is anything beyond death - to me, after death there is absolutely nothing, so being dead is just utter peace and tranquillity because you cannot experience anything. This is something i want, so badly. This state of infinite non-existence sounds so much better than whatever i’m experiencing and have ever experienced, and especially right now seeing as all i feel is constant pain interspersed with brief moments of relief when i forget. ‘Life is a pre-death experience’. 

Yet, even though, rationally, i want to die more than anything, i still don’t kill myself, and i can’t understand why. 

There is absolutely no fear in me about heaven, hell or any sort of afterlife; there is no doubt in my mind that death is the be all and end all of everything, so that cannot be the reason i don’t do it. I know i don’t have indubitable knowledge about life after death, but then again, i feel like i know without a doubt what happens, so although it doesn’t mean that there is actually nothing after death, when i am considering this problem, that is how i see it, without any uncertainty. 

The pain of dying is also not something stopping me, to my knowledge. I don’t fear pain; in fact, i embrace it. Physical pain is a welcome break from the emotional turmoil i am constantly experiencing.

Rationally, i think i should kill myself. Death would be infinitely more desirable than anything happening to me now. So i don’t fucking understand why i don’t do it.

My ideal scenario is i develop a terminal disease, for example cancer or something similar, preferably quite painful, and i die in less than a month.

I finally got things under control with my dad, we felt like we loved each other again. I had a beautiful girlfriend along with amazing friends who've always been there for me. Even a 4.0 GPA and several scholarships that would get me through college. However, it all changed in March when quarantine began and my state championship powerlifting meet was canceled, along with baseball. When I found out prom was canceled too, I was extremely discouraged, all my hard work in sports just to get it all thrown away during my SENIOR year of high school. I shook it off, after all I still had great physique, a girlfriend of 1 year, amazing friends, and a newfound relationship with my father. It was only the beginning of disaster. About a month into quarantine and online classes, my grades slipped and my dad lost his mind, we got in a physical fight which resulted in me getting kicked out of the house. I've be scarred ever since. Depression and anxiety haunted me and i struggled in online classes, which led to even worse grades and losing scholarships. The gym closed shortly after which was one of the final blows to my morale because working out was my way of blowing steam and keeping my mind sane. It spiraled out of control from here. I graduated without any ceremony or pictures or dinner or congrats, just a mail in diploma. During summer I found out i wouldn't be going on my senior trip with the boys because of covid, we planned the trip for 3 years. On top of that my girlfriend and I fought everyday for about four weeks, we broke up right before college started. Horribly out of shape, single, short on scholarships, and mind-fucked, i started college. Immediately I collapsed and couldn't maintain even a 2.5 gpa, the stress of the world was breaking me. Luckily my roommate was an avid pothead, so in order to reduce stress we smoked weed everyday. This made things worse. I gained so much weight that i don't even recognize myself, I slept in so much i missed all my classes, talk to zero females, and I have barely any friends. Now its November 2020, I hate myself and my only wish is for things to go back before covid, when i was happy.

I just want to get everything out of my heart. I always feel depressed about my situation. I am a poor 18 year old living with one mother in a poor country. My only strength is education, I got a scholarship in the best university in my country and I expect to be graduating in 2022. However, when I overthink about my future, my purpose, and my passion, I think like I am lying to myself. My main motivation is to get out, me and my family, from poverty. But then, I realise that education cannot do so. I then lose motivation, and my grades starts to decrease. I am not always depressed about this situation, but from time to time for 3 years. 

I am so lost about my purpose in life. I don't want to be that normal person that lives every day by itself (like many of my friends do), but I want to be someone with a purpose. I just lose motivation when I remember that I am nothing than a poor kid from a poor country that can't do anything but stay in poverty. I just feel that there are no reasons to continue.

,depression,"Hi all,

A little bit of background info. I'm a 14 yr old Asian girl, a freshman in high school. Recently, I've been wondering if I'm experiencing symptoms of depression or just going through a normal teenage phase.

Lately, I've noticed that I've been more sad than happy, mainly because of my parents. Don't get me wrong they're not abusive or anything, but I feel a lot of pressure in everything I do. They take away my phone if I have a B (once my grade drops), I spend the weekends doing SAT and stupid ass math worksheets, and I have 45 minutes all my phone all day and they can monitor my computer activity at all times. That being said, we've had a pretty rocky relationship lately, and I've gotten the feeling that a. I'll never live up to their standards and b. I'm kind of a disappointment. Outside of school, my parents constantly tell me I'm doing this wrong and that wrong at my sports practices, which kind of irks me because they've never even played the sport. I feel like this combination of things has driven me to the edge. They also view everything I do as a micro-aggression? I'll close my door a tiny bit too loud and they'll immediately talk about disrespect and my attitude.

Anyway, I've gotten in this state of sadness over the past couple of days. I've experienced some suicidal thoughts, but deep down I know I'm too cowardly to ever harm myself. I cry constantly, and honestly I can't find a source of happiness that's constant in my life right now. That being said, I also think I might just be an angsty teenager.

,depression,"I hate myself and I’m so lonely and I beg for attention even though I don’t deserve it and I make an embarrassment out of myself and also I’m a selfish idiot who only cares about himself yayyayayyaysyy also my life isn’t that bad I shouldn’t make such a big deal out of it but really my life isn’t that bad I pity myself too much and I enjoy being sad and I look terrible and I’m balding at 17 and no one likes me and my life isn’t that bad at all so there isn’t really a point to complain I just want someone to love me and I push people away and no one cares about me and I’m fucking ugly. I’m so lazy instead of actually helping myself I just jack myself off from how “depressed” I am. You’re not depressed you’re a fucking dickhead that doesn’t care at all about your mum or dad or how they feel, not everything is about you. You say you don’t want attention but by attempting to cover up stuff to people you’re only drawing more attention to yourself which you actually like because you’re so pathetic. Instead of wallowing how bout you actually get some work done and don’t fuck up your life. You don’t actually need to do much in order to succeed why can’t you do it. You’re so fucking spoilt that you can’t take even the slightest amount of adversity. You just stay in your room all day feeling sad, and you’re not even sad that much you’re just sad that you’re losing your hair what a big deal that is I’m sure that’ll affect your life so much I can guarantee. Except being bald makes me sad and insecure get the fuck over it you dumb cunt. The only reason you’re posting this on reddit is because you’re begging for attention from anyone. That isn’t even true your mum cares about you and gives you attention but you push her away for no reason. It’s not like your family hates you so don’t act like no one cares about you selfish asshole. You don’t need to let everyone know that you’re sad, everyone’s sad get over it. Your friend is a lot worse than you and she doesn’t let literally everyone know how sad she is.  No ones gonna read this anyways because other people aren’t responsible for dealing with your problems. Everyone has problems. Loads of people don’t have friends, your siblings don’t have friends. What makes you so special. You don’t even try to improve yourself. You don’t exercise you don’t work you don’t do anything remotely productive you just get high off Ritalin and play melee all day. You want to tell people you cut yourself today but only for attention you don’t actually want to get help you want someone else to deal with it for you because you can’t function alone and also you only cut yourself today it’s not a chronic problem get over it. You fantasise of telling emotionally unstable people how much you’ve improved as a person just so you can have sex with them, because you like that power dynamic for some fucked up reason. Don’t be under the illusion that anyone will read this, don’t pity yourself for saying that either because that’s what you want for people to feel sorry for you because of how pathetic you are. Have some fucking dignity. You’re still going to post it anyways because you’re an attention whore, not because I’m lonely, but because i push away the people that actually want to help me and treat them like shit. You appear to people that you’re the victim but you’re not. You’re a manipulative little shit, but actually I don’t hate myself that much, I’m just overblowing it so people will pay attention to me. Sure you may hate yourself now for shaving off all your hair, but is that really self hatred. No I don’t think so. But you think to yourself I must be a broken person because you’re writing this long rant on reddit. Not really it’s just because you’re not willing to invest your time into anything productive with your Ritalin. You just get high and rant for attention.

I’m so lazy instead of actually helping myself I just jack myself off from how “depressed” I am. You’re not depressed you’re a fucking dickhead that doesn’t care at all about your mum or dad or how they feel, not everything is about you. You say you don’t want attention but by attempting to cover up stuff to people you’re only drawing more attention to yourself which you actually like because you’re so pathetic. Instead of wallowing how bout you actually get some work done and don’t fuck up your life. You don’t actually need to do much in order to succeed why can’t you do it. You’re so fucking spoilt that you can’t take even the slightest amount of adversity. You just stay in your room all day feeling sad, and you’re not even sad that much you’re just sad that you’re losing your hair what a big deal that is I’m sure that’ll affect your life so much I can guarantee. Except being bald makes me sad and insecure get the fuck over it you dumb cunt. The only reason you’re posting this on reddit is because you’re begging for attention from anyone. That isn’t even true your mum cares about you and gives you attention but you push her away for no reason. It’s not like your family hates you so don’t act like no one cares about you selfish asshole. You don’t need to let everyone know that you’re sad, everyone’s sad get over it. Your friend is a lot worse than you and she doesn’t let literally everyone know how sad she is.  No ones gonna read this anyways because other people aren’t responsible for dealing with your problems. Everyone has problems. Loads of people don’t have friends, your siblings don’t have friends. What makes you so special. You don’t even try to improve yourself. You don’t exercise you don’t work you don’t do anything remotely productive you just get high off Ritalin and play melee all day. You want to tell people you cut yourself today but only for attention you don’t actually want to get help you want someone else to deal with it for you because you can’t function alone and also you only cut yourself today it’s not a chronic problem get over it. You fantasise of telling emotionally unstable people how much you’ve improved as a person just so you can have sex with them, because you like that power dynamic for some fucked up reason. Don’t be under the illusion that anyone will read this, don’t pity yourself for saying that either because that’s what you want for people to feel sorry for you because of how pathetic you are. Have some fucking dignity. You’re still going to post it anyways because you’re an attention whore, not because I’m lonely, but because i push away the people that actually want to help me and treat them like shit. You appear to people that you’re the victim but you’re not. You’re a manipulative little shit, but actually I don’t hate myself that much, I’m just overblowing it so people will pay attention to me. Sure you may hate yourself now for shaving off all your hair, but is that really self hatred. No I don’t think so. But you think to yourself I must be a broken person because you’re writing this long rant on reddit. Not really it’s just because you’re not willing to invest your time into anything productive with your Ritalin. You just get high and rant for attention. You’re so fucking narcissistic, when I’m looking back on the things I wrote “no I don’t think so” what a fucking asshole. What do you think you’re smarter than everyone else no you’re not you’re kind of an emotional retard. How bout you appreciate the people around you for once&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"The school I worked at had a COVID case so I have to stay in my room so I don’t pass it to my parents. My biggest fear is something bad happening to them. 

Now that I have been stuck in my room for 2 days, I am starting to feel even worse than before. I get strong urges to end my life and then everything goes numb. I cry a lot and I can’t stop it. If I have to work on something remotely difficult, I will start panicking and crying. And I need constant validation and comfort. I had started sleeping beside my mom and sometimes my little sister because I couldn’t sleep alone without crying. I take everything personally. I get hurt really easily.

And on top of everything I am taking a gap year because the program I was in started this mess. And I got into a messy relationship because I was willing to anything he wanted so he wouldn’t leave me. It wasn’t his fault. Because I’m now realizing that I am becoming an empty shell of a person.

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have been stuck in my room for 2 days, I am starting to feel even worse than before. I get strong urges to end my life and then everything goes numb. I cry a lot and I can’t stop it. If I have to work on something remotely difficult, I will start panicking and crying. And I need constant validation and comfort.

Depending on if it’s the weekend or not, I will either arrive 30 mins late for school, or stay home and do nothing with my life all day. I feel guilty for even thinking about trying to get better, trying to move forward in life. I hold so much guilt and shame from times in my life when I was a selfish asshole, labels and marks I can never shake off. 

Oh and by the way, I am really really fat, I am 5’6 and weigh 94kg, from when I used to eat junk food and never exercise because I thought I couldn’t because of severe clubfoot in both of my feet that was treated very badly by doctors when I was a kid, where I couldn’t run or do physical activity for even a moderate amount of time, lest I risk excruciating pain for the rest of the day. But it wasn’t because of that, I’m just pathetic, no goals and aspirations in life, constantly paranoid and anxious about the future.

I play the guitar I suppose, a few other instruments too. But for a while now, the fun has been sucked out of that as well. My dad constantly pressuring me to play for his sake, as well as not having anything to play on guitar anymore, basically ruined that for me. I still play it, but it’s no longer fun to learn a song I heard once that sounded cool.

I know I am a toxic, shitty person. I don’t deserve to be around others, I would only ever scare them away with my bullshit. I deeply messed up my relationship with a girl I loved very much, that was three years ago and I’m still not over it. I feel unimaginable guilt and shame for ruining the relationship by coming on too strongly and not controlling my tendency to cry and isolate myself whenever we get into arguments. I don’t trust myself with a relationship after that one, history will repeat itself yet again, I just know it.

My relationship with my parents isn’t really ruined yet, but it’s getting there. I know they’re trying their best. They constantly ask me “what’s wrong?”, and “what are you feeling right now?”. But I don’t think they understand just how unexplainable depression can be.
They seem to think of it as just ‘being sad’. It’s so so much more than that.

I’m 16 years old and I don’t even want to know what I want to study in uni, hell, I don’t even know if I can go in the state I am right now. I had dreams and aspirations during young naïve parts of my live, where I actually felt happy, because I wasn’t overthinking my future. But those dreams and aspirations have been lost in the sands of time. 

Everyone in my classes at school seems to have the whole world in the palm of their hand. Everyone is over confident, smiling, being with friends, knowing that their future is going to be just great. I had friends, until I pushed them away for what, for me to be alone for a while?? What a selfish, nasty bastard I must be.

Nothing gives me emotions anymore. I can no longer feel joy, anger, disgust, surprise. I have one mood, and that is a blank, melancholic mood, that is colder than any ice or cold thing you will ever touch.

I think back to some bad things I did in my youth, and constantly ruminate over the worst case scenario of what could happen to me. Then I believe that that worse case scenario will actually happen irl. It seems that the true enemy in my body is my own mind and imagination.

I’ve been having very scary delusions and paranoia recently. Like for example, i’m scared of being watched by my school through my webcam on my school pc, i’m afraid of people looking through my window while I sleep, I’m afraid that, while sleeping, someone will come into our house and steal our stuff or worse, harm us. I’m afraid of being arrested, even if I did nothing wrong. I’m afraid that I have unknowingly installed a virus on my pc, so that a criminal can track my keystrokes and find out personal information, passwords, and my card number. Why do I care so much about all this? I thought i hated my life!

So why, life? Why am I here, when the only purpose I serve in life is making sure I don’t do something drastic like kill myself because “my family would be sad” or whatever. Because there’s not much reason to live if all I do is just float through life, not making anything of myself.

In fact, that’s the only reason why I stay on this mortal coil day in day out, is because I’m too much of a pussy to see what death will be like. I feel stuck between these two worlds, a purgatory, and I can’t get to neither of them.

&amp;#x200B;

They always told me

Music is the expression of your feelings

Of your emotions

&amp;#x200B;

Thats why a lot of people sing about love, happiness 

About their passed ones, killed brother, sister’s suicide

Money, drugs and girls aren’t lyrics 

Its fake inspiration when they tryna look good

&amp;#x200B;

Mine’s a little more complicated

Its my family falling a part

My sister falling apart

Myself falling a part

&amp;#x200B;

Living nomad, they said it was a life style?

Having no sedentary place, you guys really like that?

&amp;#x200B;

Coming home to negative attitude

Gotta be king of the place cuz the others are falling apart

Having to be there for them cuz they need it

Having to act as the man cuz they can’t live without one

Having to make yourself look happy cuz people can’t deal with bad emotions

&amp;#x200B;

Tryna put it down low

Living with no where to go

Putty on a fake smile

Giving advice to people without knowing your the one needing it

&amp;#x200B;

If only that day never came

Separation man, fuck that

Its the worst thing a family can do

Kids having parents loving somebody else

What the fuck is even that

&amp;#x200B;

You guys were supposed to be my ideal

I was suppose to have you as my love story goal

but you erased it

&amp;#x200B;

Images fade, is love even real

Im in a forever ending love that won’t ever workout

Cuz I saw it in my parents

&amp;#x200B;

The image that I had, gone in 2 weeks

Yeah cuz we see it coming,

Tryna hide it but the day you start sleeping in different beds

Everything becomes clear

The water isn’t flowing anymore

The roses, brown dead

&amp;#x200B;

If only I had the money to go alone

To live on my own

To hide from this constant pain going on in front of me

I just want to put it to the side and call it a day

Put you guys are always there to remind me of it

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to go far away

Away from here, away from you

I just want to live on my own

Not having to see you

No reminder of the ending love story of my life

&amp;#x200B;

Dude do you even realize that

The love story that made me come to life

The attraction that had taken place for me to be born

It was strong enough and willing full so that two kids could be born

&amp;#x200B;

And in a instant pouff

Explodes

And i can’t even say a word

&amp;#x200B;

The happiness that was there during all my life

Pouff gone

Now its just constant reminder

&amp;#x200B;

Been living nomad for two years

Always getting shitted on for the stupidest things cuz they can’t deal with their own emotions

And they let em flowing to us thinking that their acting as parents teaching us

But what they’re really giving us

Is the hate growing slowly and slowly deep inside

&amp;#x200B;

They're  just reminding us that they failed 

Every fkin day

every single stupidest skin day

I just want to get out of here

And not see them

Taking a break 

&amp;#x200B;

If I had the money

Id already be gone

Im saying all this to a page

,depression,Yesterday I smoked weed for the first time in a long time. I had a horrible reaction to it and had to go to the emergency room. I called my ex gf (we broke up like 2 weeks ago) while high and begged her to take me back. She told me to wait until the next day and see what I felt like when I wasn't high. When I woke up today I still felt the same. I sent her a very sweet and well thought out text asking her to take me back and she said no. That made me feel horrible. I was willing to forget all the bad stuff she did that made me break up with her but she said I hurt her too much by breaking up with her. She said she still loves and misses me but she can't be with me. I wanted to hang up and cry but she convinced me not to. Then she lied to me about drinking tonight because I could tell she was kinda drunk. Lying was one of the main reasons I broke up with her. I feel as though I have been stabbed through the heart.

,depression,"So yesterday my grandma passed, presumably from Covid since she tested positive last week. I only found out from my aunt messaging me, my dad didn’t even bother leaving a note about it. She asked how I felt about it but I didn’t answer it since... I dont really feel anything.

My grandma suffered a stroke years ago and she lost use of her left limbs. So, that way of living was a huge struggle as you could imagine. She was lonely and depressed. No one should have to live through that Hell. I think what happened was, well, a relief in someway for her.

The last time I talked to her was over 2 years ago. I felt uncomfortable around her in that state. I can’t even remember any fond memories with her as a kid.

I’m expecting to feel quite uncomfortable at the funeral because of my lack of emotions. Everyone else in the family is going to be mourning and *together*. I’m always the *black sheep*, whether it’s family, friends, school, work, or society. I feel like I dont have any sort of family bonds with anyone. And I can only ever cry for myself now, which I hate.

I don’t know, and I hate knowing that people would never tell me. Criticism and development doesn’t exist for me. Especially in this year, people prefer to avoid interactions and confrontation; they often just block or ignore others on social media. I believe socialization is fundamental to human life, and without it, there can’t be happiness. Even so, I tried to isolate myself (without being a shut-in). I focused on what I can do solely by myself. I have studied programming, arts like modeling and drawing, language, etc. I tried to workout because supposedly fitness is just so damn important. There’s no joy there...

I always go back to wanting to meet someone. I want a friend - a real one. It seems it will never happen. I will never know why.

,depression,"Hello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

Years no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind. I just want the pain to end, I just want to not be alone, and want someone to hug me and tell me I’m valid.",t2_8jw73zzx,False,,0,False,I’m going to meet my end soon,[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jy4dh2,False,dark,1.0,,public,1,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,1,,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1605960728.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I despise my family more than I despised the bullies in my old elementary schools. They all think like the one person I hate out of all of them: my mother. I don't even consider her my mother but I don't have any other name to substitute for that other than Medusa but I like Medusa so I'll refer her as Donkey. 

This Donkey can go fuck herself. All of the little ones take after her and it irritates me so much. Every single damned day, I hear them repeat the exact same words at the stupid Donkey and they don't even care about what's right and wrong anymore. The little ones have been negatively influenced by the stupid Donkey and I can't do anything. My favorite ones they've recently learned is ""Kill yourself"" and ""Mommy doesn't like you anymore."" 

The stupid Donkey won't ever shut up even when she knows she's in the wrong. I honestly hate this stupid donkey so much, that I would rather wish her out of existence or better yet, end up dead. I don't care what you guys think of me; whether I'm an ungrateful brat or that one entitled person but it won't matter either way. I'm so tired of it all and she doesn't care. Don't tell me my family misunderstands my feelings, hell, they don't even THINK I have emotions like them. I hate them and want them to disappear or even die in the worst possible way. They don't care about me or my well being and sure as hell made it so very fucking clear that I'm at their disposal. They call me a waste of skin? Nah man, fuck that. THEY'RE the waste of skins, they're the waste of resources, simply having them around is insulting enough. These people are by far the worst I've ever met and if you can do worse, please do. I'm fed up with this life. I'm fed up with everything, my life has no more meaning and I still can't ever bring myself to believe that my friends even care about me.

The stupid Donkey only wants sex and uses my dad for her own personal gain. More kids = more $$ she says. She forgets who has to pay child support and she's over here whoring herself even more. I refuse to take care of her offspring and just by the thought of BEING her offspring is enough to make me puke. She is despicable, she is conniving, she is a liar, she is outright horrible. Believing herself to be the center of attention and wanting to 'steal the spotlight'. Her parents are not aware of this sick behavior and maybe won't believe me if I told them of this. 

I'm just tired of this. I used to have this cute little puppy golden retriever mixbreed and a puppy German Shephard. They ultimately were sent elsewhere (maybe the pound I assume) because the stupid Donkey decided that she didn't like dogs when they didn't listen to her or 'obey' her. It feels like she treats me like a robot, maybe my whole family does treat me like a robot; devoid of human thought and incapable of emotions. They're messed up and I hate them for it. I don't care if they end up not being at fault, I still hate them. Give me back my 15 years of life you all took away from me, forcing me to tend to the flesh parasites that comes out of your vagina because you couldn't keep your legs closed for 2 seconds. 

I want the time you all took for me. I didn't ask for this, you put this all on me the minute you had your 6th flesh parasite. You created so many problems and decided to not own up to your problems, so you burdened your 5th oldest flesh parasite. You are not a mother, you are by far the poorest excuse of a mother. You never take responsibility and you always drink constantly. I'm still surprised that the other flesh parasites came out unaffected whilst you drank during pregnancy. I will hate you forevermore in this life and the next ones. What you've done is unforgivable and I am 100% sure you won't give a fuck since it won't benefit you in any way.

Honestly, I have never been responsible for myself. I didn't do well in school, so I couldn't get a good job while most of my classmates could. Since I am counting dollars for survival, I cannot afford to go out on a date, not even for a coffee. I was a virgin till 23, but then I just got it done with a prostitute. However, I can't afford to visit prostitutes much, if at all. Once I got so desperate that I got drunk and hooked up with a gay man on Tinder, but I couldn't enjoy it at all. I feel a burning desire to hold a woman close to me but I can't have anyone. And this feeling of missing out on physical affection is making me extremely miserable, I can't focus on getting a new job. This is the gridlock - lack of affection doesn't let me work, lack of work(i.e. money) doesn't let me get affection. I have wasted a lot of my money on alcohol and cigarettes, I feel really guilty about that.

I do feel happy when I get drunk. That's why I can't stop drinking once I start. Just a few days ago, I drank 3 Four Lokos and fell down on the street, and called 911. But whenever I don't drink for a couple of days, the reality just comes crashing down. I forget about my balding when I get drunk, but when I get sober, I just break down realizing that I don't have much chances of getting a girlfriend. I can't take it and I drink again. My baldness is my own fault - I masturbated heavily over the past several years, knowing that it will harm me. I just find that my mind stops working whenever I do that.

I know that life is unfair and that I am not as good as the other men out there. I know that sex is a privilege and not a right. However, whenever this realization hits me, I feel a deep knot in my stomach. We get life only once, and I just can't get over the fact that I am going to be bald in this one life that I get. I also can't get over the fact that I missed out on the peak years of my libido. Sometimes, I get some dark thoughts - like buying a pet and killing it. I am afraid to accept the reality that I am not good enough because I feel that that might make me complacent, which might lead to me losing opportunities.

I can&amp;#39;t take it and I drink again. My baldness is my own fault - I masturbated heavily over the past several years, knowing that it will harm me. I just find that my mind stops working whenever I do that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know that life is unfair and that I am not as good as the other men out there. I know that sex is a privilege and not a right. However, whenever this realization hits me, I feel a deep knot in my stomach. We get life only once, and I just can&amp;#39;t get over the fact that I am going to be bald in this one life that I get. I also can&amp;#39;t get over the fact that I missed out on the peak years of my libido. Sometimes, I get some dark thoughts - like buying a pet and killing it. I am afraid to accept the reality that I am not good enough because I feel that that might make me complacent, which might lead to me losing opportunities. I really don&amp;#39;t know how to think about my life so as to live the best possible life that I can have. Please help me. I don&amp;#39;t have anyone - I can&amp;#39;t talk to my parents about this because they are ultra-conservative and they demonize sex.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"So for the last three years i have been burying myself in books and movies and tv and video games and unfortunately drugs, its not bad drugs, its a herb in Thailand.
But this last year has put me on the gloomy train.
And its been hard and there is soooo much to this story of mine and so little space on here.
But long story short, i just lost my dad when i was 9.
When i was 5, i was molested by my older step sister and brother, but my sister was more forceful about it.
When i was 12 all the way until i was 15, i was put into a mental facility for my anger towards my past, i was violent, i was born into a lack of emotional family of drunk germans, so that means my mother was at the bar every night so i was neglected and abandoned even at the facility.
Anywuas, im a fricken mess and ots all flooding back to my from my subconscious and emotions are so wild and its hard to feel them so like i said, i started doing drugs and reading and poetry and running away into the videoverse.
I am a broken record because I've been trying to quit drugs for a year now and i dont have anyone to help me, when my dad died, al my brothers and sisters got adapted and taken away from my step mom, so now its just me and my. Mother, but shes not very helpful and She s a mess too, and i cant count on her to help me overcome my own addiction when she's drinking all the time.
Anyways, when i was a angry child, my grandmother disowned me to my face when i was 10, she told me when didn't want me and she always invited my other brothers and sisters to her house and never wanted me to come.
And then my grandmother and grandpa on my dads side put a restraining order on me because my older step sister and brother did drugs when my dad died and they thought a ten year old (me) was just as bad, so i havent spoke to them sense i was a wee las.
So i am well.....
I feel worthless and meaningless and i feel as good as a garbage can becuase thats how everyone treated me as a child and adult.
I wish i was born into a real family, i mean i think its cool that my ancestors were crazy kings of the 18th century germany, and my great aunt owns have of munic, but it doesnt make up for the shite my family did to me and what i did to them.

So i found one certainly and its traveling, just the thought of being on the open road and climbing  mountains and being in a new town and city everyday litterly cures my sadness and makes me feel so happy!

,depression,"Alright, so I've noticed very small and slight patterns of OCD in my personality since I was quite young. I've never really done anything about it since I was aware of the fact that it mostly had to do and was related to low self confidence that over time as I grew older thankfully got a lot better. However today still, whenever I have to present myself to the world let's say through pictures or even worse videos, something terrible kicks in, and takes over me. I'm writing this post after I had to complete an online job interview by submitting a 40 sec presentation of myself. 

When I read video submission of myself I knew right away. I thought though, alright let's give it a try maybe it'll be better this time maybe I'll manage, and I'll do this stupid thing in one take. Yeah right, sweet dreams. It took me almost 2 hours, 2 hours to finally say okay I think, with emphasize on I think I have it. In the making of my video I've bumped into the following issues : not liking my voice in one, not liking my face in the other, not liking the tone I was using to say words in another one, not liking the way I blink, not liking my side eye, not liking how I open my mouth and so on. Yes, I know how this sounds, these are not metaphors, these were all real reasons why I stopped and redid it again and again and again. At one point I thought okay I have it, then something deep inside compelled me so strongly to give it another take, and another and another, because it's not good enough, it can be better. This is why I'm linking this issue to OCD I believe. Because of that strong feeling of not being able to stop. Please be so kind to tell me and let me know what do you think this is?? It's killing me sometimes and makes me hate myself. It's unacceptable to literally loose 2 hrs of my life and my time over something so stupid and insignificant. I know that from the outside it looks like I have huge confidence issues, but generally speaking with people, friends, going out, I'm not shy, awkward or unsure at all. I love socializing and I generally have a good opinion of myself in healthy way so I don't struggle with it externally only internally and just when it comes to things like this - pictures, videos, projects etc. Anything through which I have to prove myself. I'm make a too big deal of it even though literally no one cares that much. I'm sickly harsh with myself and have a dose of perfectionism in personality that rockets through the sky sometimes as presented above. Sadly, whenever we send videos back and forth with my friend who knows me deeply and closely, I'm the same.

I have a massive hatred towards my parents. I was born and raised by a hardcore Christian mother and an emotional absive father. 


Mom was clinically diagnosis as mostly sterile before my parents got married. My dad think it was a great idea to have no contraception during intercourse... which leads their marriage to a financially struggling situation from the get-go. 
 My mom is a overly optimistic person, she often express that I was God's gift. And that I should be happy to live my life. And for my dad, I see him regrets marrying this delusional woman and having kids. My dad never has the patient and compassion for children. For the pass 21 years, I was traumatize by all his screaming and scolding. I was able to move out with my boyfriend last year. I rarely see my dad currently, but for times I have to attend fanily gatherings, i am stressed out and want to leave immediately just by interacting with dad.


Recently I was hospitalized for my depression. During the stay, I was informed that my grandmothers from both sides of the family suffers from depression and anxiety as well. Which got me wondering if Im more prone to have mental illness deal to genetics.


Going back to my topic, I am planning to get sterilisation next year. I don't mind interacting with children. However I can't see myself raising a child of my own. I will not forgive myself if my child has to suffer with mental illness passed down from generations. 


To many people in my country, this idea is absurd. However I rather be membered as a no body, than a depressed mother who neglected their child when I die.

,depression,"Hey everyone. My boyfriend and I have been doing long distance for about 2 years now. He opened up to me about a year ago about his depression and what he goes through, and i’ve been there for him through everything. It seems to mostly effect him in the mornings. Some days he is up/bright/bubbly, other days he can’t get out of bed/quick to anger/upset/crying. I’ve been researching and reading up as much as i can on depression since i have never experienced it hands on. 

When it comes to night time, he’s a completely different person from the morning, like he did a 180. I have been telling him how proud of him I am when he does the little things i know are hard. For example, getting out of bed and going outside to get fresh air, making a meal and eating it, taking a shower. When the morning rolls around, it seems to have all come back again. And i understand why. 

I was thinking it would benefit him to seek professional help through a therapist or a counselor? I don’t have too much understand about any of that, but i would like to know if therapy has benefited/worsened your depression and why? 

He has also made it clear to me that he doesn’t want to be on medication to change him, which of course i agree with, but maybe there’s something out there that won’t make him feel the way he does in the mornings &amp; help him get through the day temporarily. 

I told him i’m never leaving his side and i’m here through anything and everything. I really love him and i would love to do anything i can that would be a benefit to him. 

Side Note: The distance is the least problem here. We have been pushing through the distance for our end goal in the near future. Once you are doing long distance for a while, you really get the hang of it :)

Hi everyone ~ ! 
Im just posting because.. 
Well, so I can’t say I fully understand everyone’s situation. I know everyone is different. But I know what it’s like to feel like the loneliest person in entire earth. I know what it feels like to want to end everything and put a stop to you. 
Ive tried to end my life in the past, it’s a decision that would’ve changed everything. Even now, I still think to myself “what if I decided to just end it?” 
Either way this isn’t about me! 
I just want to let you all know that I (If you believe no one cares), I care about you. I like to say I have a big heart and care for everyone. I like to listen to people and talk to people. 
I know I sound cliche and it maybe stupid but I just don’t want anyone to feel as alone as they think they are. 
Im here for you. 
As a fellow sad person(I prefer sad over depressed), I am with you. 
For anyone who wants to talk/vent/advice, or just maybe start up a friendship, feel free to message me. I’m always on my phone so I’m always free.

,depression,"I need advice quick. I’m already on max dose of antidepressants but it’s not enough now. 

1) I’ve been extremely weak and bed ridden for the last 16 months with an illness that doctors can’t diagnose. I can only take 2,000 - 2,500 steps per day. Talking for more than 15 min exhausts me to the point I start slurring and going limp. My entire existence is doing 1 load of laundry and 1 load of dishes per day. That’s it. What sucks is my mind is still running at 100%. I feel like a Lamborghini trapped in a go cart with a busted wheel. Not to mention I’m a 7/10 level pain (at least), 24 hours a day 

2) COVID. I can’t even go to Target and scoot around on their electric buggies. I couldn’t fight off a cold right now, let alone COVID

3) My husband has stopped paying attention to me. He’s probably sick of dealing with a completely dependent wife. He doesn’t listen when I try to talk about it. 

Guys I need to find something to occupy my mind and entertain me or I’m going to wind up attempting suicide again. I have no purpose. I feel completely useless. And the boredom is crippling. After 16 months of this I’m sick of TV and the one hobby I can do (crochet).  I can’t afford a therapist. I have no friends left, they all disappeared the minute I got sick. I don’t know what to do. I feel so isolated and useless 

EDIT: please.....I appreciate the consideration but I’m not looking for medical advice about my mystery physical condition. That’s not why I’m here. Believe me when I tell you that every possible medical condition has been checked for by a team of doctors. In 16 months I’ve had 56 doctor, lab and imaging appointments. I’ve seen 6 different specialties of doctor, WITH second opinions on all of them. What I need help with is the crippling loneliness, boredom and depression. Again I appreciate any concern about my medical condition but that’s a whole different ball of wax. 

In short: YES I have been tested for that. YES I have tried that. NO it didn’t help. 

Again I know it’s well intended but I need mental help, not help with my physical affliction. If comments just becomes focused on the latter, I’m going to take this post down because I’ve heard it all. Thank you.  &lt;3",t2_8yuirqcj,False,,0,False,"I’m facing a triple threat, and I’m about to loose",[],r/depression,False,0.0,,0,,False,t3_jxpvpj,False,dark,1.0,,public,7,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,7,,False,,1605885767.0,,[],{},,True,,1605910997.0,text,0.0,,,text,self.depression,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;I need advice quick. I’m already on max dose of antidepressants but it’s not enough now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1) I’ve been extremely weak and bed ridden for the last 16 months with an illness that doctors can’t diagnose. I can only take 2,000 - 2,500 steps per day. Talking for more than 15 min exhausts me to the point I start slurring and going limp. My entire existence is doing 1 load of laundry and 1 load of dishes per day. That’s it. What sucks is my mind is still running at 100%. I feel like a Lamborghini trapped in a go cart with a busted wheel. Not to mention I’m a 7/10 level pain (at least), 24 hours a day &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2) COVID. I can’t even go to Target and scoot around on their electric buggies. I couldn’t fight off a cold right now, let alone COVID&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3) My husband has stopped paying attention to me. He’s probably sick of dealing with a completely dependent wife. He doesn’t listen when I try to talk about it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Guys I need to find something to occupy my mind and entertain me or I’m going to wind up attempting suicide again. I have no purpose. I feel completely useless. And the boredom is crippling. After 16 months of this I’m sick of TV and the one hobby I can do (crochet).  I can’t afford a therapist. I have no friends left, they all disappeared the minute I got sick. I don’t know what to do. I feel so isolated and useless &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EDIT: please.....I appreciate the consideration but I’m not looking for medical advice about my mystery physical condition. That’s not why I’m here. Believe me when I tell you that every possible medical condition has been checked for by a team of doctors. In 16 months I’ve had 56 doctor, lab and imaging appointments. I’ve seen 6 different specialties of doctor, WITH second opinions on all of them. What I need help with is the crippling loneliness, boredom and depression. Again I appreciate any concern about my medical condition but that’s a whole different ball of wax. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short: YES I have been tested for that. YES I have tried that. NO it didn’t help. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Again I know it’s well intended but I need mental help, not help with my physical affliction. If comments just becomes focused on the latter, I’m going to take this post down because I’ve heard it all. Thank you.  &amp;lt;3&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#39;ve always known that they don&amp;#39;t have the same heart I do, that they don&amp;#39;t outwardly show how they care for me. And I know they care for me - but I never really feel they do, maybe only superficially. This is with every relationship I have and I cannot keep going. I try to make sure everyone is ok, is it too much to desire that one person does the same for me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#x200B;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am defeated. My heart has turned cold. I don&amp;#39;t know what to do or where to go from here. My soul feels dead. I just want to disappear, not exactly die, but just be gone.&lt;/p&gt;

Funniest things in all my situation that (i know they can and ALREADY MAKE it worse):

1. I, myself, try to help everyone with they're mental health and giving advise that ACTUALLY work and helped them
2. After helping them, no one stays and continue to talk with me, and i think i know why, but some said that i am just ""not ready"" to be friend with them (how does it even work), other did not say anything, they just leave
3. Because of №2, i've never been hugged in my life (beside my mom, tho, i don't even let her anymore, because for me it feel somehow wrong or idk)
4. And because of №3, my longest, ahem, ""relationship"" were 1 hour. (Because so many people find in relationship they're hope and motivation)

,depression,"Hello. I‘m new to this whole reddit thing but I thought thats the only way to talk about my problems without feeling ashamed. I’m trying my best to put it in words which is kinda hard. So first of I’m 27 years old and I deal with depression a long time back when the woman who raised me died in 2013 or maybe even earlier when my grandma died in 2005 both due to cancer. But 2013 hit me way harder or it’s my whole life in general. My mom got pregnant with me at 15 years old and got left by my dad we are from a small town in Germany so I was the number 1 talk around the village and because she didn’t had the time for me my aunt took care of me basically my whole life until she died in 2013. And when I first heard the news of her having cancer I kinda shutdown before I was an outgoing person had me friends and at the time I just turned 18 so I thought hell yeah now I can party my ass off and drive around my car and have the time of my life but after I received the news I completely self isolated. I didn’t answer messages from my friends or family and just dove into video games to get my mind off of it. I ordered stuff online which I couldn’t pay at the end. I kinda turned in this self destructive mode which I didn’t care about what’s happening with my relationships or myself. I didn’t even talk with my aunt that much because I couldn’t see her suffering which haunts me till this day. I was so selfish that I didn’t understand with me not talking to her that much she suffered even more. . So we are talking about a time
Period of about 2years so from early 2011 to late 2013. So in that time I had to undergo surgery myself which put me back even further and I isolated even more. The healing process took way longer than expected and I couldn’t do anything and even needed help getting to the toilet. It took until one family member told me my aunt only had a couple of weeks left to live that I kinda got out of the hole got a job and helped more at home. I found a really supportive company with a great boss and everything turned more to the bright side until my aunt died right before my apprenticeship started. I took some time off before to help more at home and my aunt ask me if I still have my job. After that I lost completely the ground under my feet and if I didn’t get back with my school sweetheart a few months earlier I’d probably try and kill myself. My boss told me I had all the support from the company that I need and I can take as much time of as I want. Which was a great help. So after I got kinda fit again I started working again did my apprenticeship with a great end score. But then I heard the news that my dad died I tried reaching out to him a few times as kid but he refused it all the time but there was always that little hope that I might could connect with him in the future and that this hope was gone too I lost it again. It kinda hit me as hard as when my aunt died. But now I was part of this company for a few years and they supported me the whole time and I didn’t want to disappoint either them or my girlfriend. So after I got back up again I moved out of the house away from my uncle. He made me the black sheep for everything happening after my aunt died and put me in such a bad mood that I couldn’t live there anymore so my boss helped me find an apartment and supported me with everything he is like the dad I’ve never had which sounds kinda corny but yeah. So I lived in the apartment with me girlfriend I was doing great. Everything worked and almost anything I tried worked. I was doing great at my job I live with my dream girl until I got the same condition again that I’ve had before and needed another surgery and this time the healing process wouldn’t stop so I got way less money from my health insurance I couldn’t afford rent anymore. The bills started coming in so I decided to start working again earlier than I should. And my condition got worse the scar I got from the surgery wouldn’t heal properly. To stop all this mess we moved back in in the house of my uncle who begged me all the time to come back again. So I agreed because my girlfriend and I could really need this relief from rent and everything. But my scar still wouldn’t heal. So I had to stop working and undergo surgery again and this time they had to remove skin from my butt and lift it over my scar so I had to spent 7 days in hospital and couldn’t go to toilet without help again. The surgery happened in February this year and it put me in such a funk because now my girlfriend had to wipe my butt had to shower me and I had such a remorse to put her through all of that this whole time. She went through everything with me. So basically now I am sick for nearly 2 years my mental and financial condition gets worse every month and I am in such a bad mood that I feel almost like the time again where my aunt got sick and died.

,depression,"I’m really tired of how I’ve been feeling emotionally

I have been broken up with my ex-girlfriend for a year and 5 months after being together for 5 years. We got in a really bad argument when I was having a manic episode, that wasn’t even diagnosed at that point. I never got to say goodbye properly to her after the argument because I was put in a psyche ward for having  suicidal thoughts . We were best friends before being lovers and that’s what hurts the most. Everyday I struggle why it just seems like she’s vanished from my life. We had ups and downs in our relationship but I really wish things didn’t end up the way they did.

I have no way to contact her because I’m blocked ( I understand it’s creepy to harass an ex). I’ve had encounters with other women since then and no one matches up to her and how she made me feel as a person. The sense of exploration we had together was unmatched. Always thought she would be apart of my life forever. I have had zero contact with her and it makes me feel awful that I can’t see her smile again.

I was diagnosed with bi polar manic after the manic episode and the stay in the hospital. I was put on a bunch of different pills like mood stabilizers etc, to try and help me feel more normal but I felt like they made me have panic attacks and made me feel so off and angry so I flushed them and just continued to smoke weed to combat my anxiety that I have. I have friends that I love and family that I love but it just never seems like enough.

,depression,"We have been married for a little over two years. I have had depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts since I was young however I kept it hidden until a year ago when I attempted suicide.

Before then everyone though of me as gregarious, funny, outgoing, someone going places, but really I was just good at copying behaviors I thought people appreciated and keeping the rest hidden. 

Since my attempt I have opened up to my family and husband about how I coped with alcohol and pot without him knowing. How I planned and and took steps to end my life, and that I just felt dull and out of place.

He has been such a rock and so supportive, I promised I would not have another attempt and would try everything. That I would seek therapy, be honest with my therapist and psychiatrist, and take any meds that I needed too in front of him everyday and above all be honest with him on how I was doing.

I was diagnosed with major depression with manic episodes (possibly bipolar type 1), major anxiety, and ADHD. After meeting with a therapist weekly for an hr and with a psychiatrist every 10 days for 8 weeks I have finally reached what I feel is suppose to be “normal” but my husband is now worried I’m over medicated. I feel level headed but not like a zombie, like my head is now organized and not cluttered, that I can actually prioritize things and achieve them without beating myself up if I do not get to everything. I’m working out and eating healthy, not drinking any alcohol or smoking any pot, journaling, and most of all no longer have suicidal thoughts or ideas. 

However my husband is concerned and is now wanting me to reduce my medication, not because of any unwanted behaviors but because of the number and frequency of medications. I realize this is a lot and not completely specific to depression but wanted to see if anyone has dealt with this before or this mix of medications and what has or has not worked for them. 

This is my current medication schedule:
8am- 40 mg of Prozac, .5 mg of Klonopin, and 10 mg of adderall

Noon- 10 mg of adderall

4pm- .5 mg of klonopin

5pm- 10 mg of adderall

An hour before bed- 2 mg of pracozin (for night terrors)

&lt;p&gt;Before then everyone though of me as gregarious, funny, outgoing, someone going places, but really I was just good at copying behaviors I thought people appreciated and keeping the rest hidden. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since my attempt I have opened up to my family and husband about how I coped with alcohol and pot without him knowing. How I planned and and took steps to end my life, and that I just felt dull and out of place.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He has been such a rock and so supportive, I promised I would not have another attempt and would try everything. That I would seek therapy, be honest with my therapist and psychiatrist, and take any meds that I needed too in front of him everyday and above all be honest with him on how I was doing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t left my home since mid-February and ever since then, day by day, week by week, month by fucking month, I’ve been getting worse and worse. I’m basically alone for 24 hours a day as my housemate works a lot, which is even scarier due to COVID as I suspect somebody at their work has the virus, and even when they are around, it’s usually the dead of night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What the fuck do I even do at this point? I’ve been thinking bad things again and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve &lt;em&gt;tried&lt;/em&gt; multiple times in the past and never succeeded and for years, I’ve managed to avoid this mindset completely but it’s come back this year and I’m scared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t really know why I’m typing all of this but I just don’t know what else to do. I’m afraid that I won’t be around to see next year and that’s a terrifying thought.&lt;/p&gt;

That’s all I really want. I just want to not have to exist. I’m not suicidal, just so sick of everything. I’m on three different antidepressants and I’m maxed out on therapy. This is unfortunately as good as it gets for me. My sister always tells me that I’m “good at having depression” and I am. I have a decent job, I’m a pre-med student, I have my own apartment and car and life. From all outward appearances everything is fine. I have my shit together. I just hate having to do all this.

I’m up here alone, going through a breakup, my parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage and my best friends mom just got diagnosed with cancer and my therapist just went on a two month leave so I literally have nobody I am comfortable reaching out for help at this time. I can’t get any school done because my entire day consists of bawling and anxiety attacks, i am in such a bad place and i honestly just want to die. I’ve been considering going to an impatient treatment center as i have done that about 5 times as a teen when things got so bad i couldn’t handle it on my own anymore but i know if i do it will cause me to fail every class i’m in and i will be stuck in this situation another semester and out thousands of dollars.

I feel like my mental health is getting out of my control, i want control of my life again and i feel like it is controlling every aspect.

I’m going into my senior year and my classes are harder than they’ve ever been. On top of that I’m suicidal. I’ve dealt with suicide attempts as a teen but haven’t had ideations in over 6 years so I’m terrified. I’m up here alone, going through a breakup, my parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage and my best friends mom just got diagnosed with cancer and my therapist just went on a two month leave so I literally have nobody I am comfortable reaching out for help at this time. I can’t get any school done because my entire day consists of bawling and anxiety attacks, i am in such a bad place and i honestly just want to die. I’ve been considering going to an impatient treatment center as i have done that about 5 times as a teen when things got so bad i couldn’t handle it on my own anymore but i know if i do it will cause me to fail every class i’m in and i will be stuck in this situation another semester and out thousands of dollars. I feel so incredibly stuck. I am so isolated because of covid, i don’t get to see my friends much, classes are cut to about an hour a day if that in person and i’m barely working. I get almost no social interaction and it’s really getting to me. This time of year is always hard but the isolation and stress of school and a breakup and this goddamn year in general is just pushing me further than I can handle. I feel like my mental health is getting out of my control, i want control of my life again and i feel like it is controlling every aspect. I really want to live but i’m scared i will get to the point where the intrusive suicidal thoughts turn into more. I’m scared, i’m alone and i am stuck. I’m really doing my best to just get through the semester but I don’t know how to, i just don’t have the motivation and just existing is exhausting, my responsibilities make me feel like i’m drowning. I’m just terrified and i feel so fucking alone. I don’t know how to stop things from getting worse and I promise you i’m doing my best but i am in a constant war with myself right now. I just want my life back, i don’t want to feel like this anymore. It just feels so unfair, i thought i was doing so well up until this year. I stopped self harming years ago and haven’t seriously thought about suicide is years, i’ve been in therapy and going to a great school for something so hard, i was so proud of where i was but now i hate myself for being back here. I don’t know if i can go though this again, the first time almost killed me. I’m exhausted and i just want to feel okay again..&lt;/p&gt;

This isn’t a way to live, it’s not something I would wish on the worst person on the planet. The melancholy biting at me, but even it doesn’t get through the lack of emotion, the lack of care, the lack of attachment.

,depression,"Hello,  rn I have alot of problems in my life (I guess that that is relative maybe, but there is/ are big problem(s) ). I thought about going to seek help, but then I also think, ohh you are just overexegerating. Though there are some problems I will have to fix myself, actually all of them because change starts with myself. I have periods where I feel ok-ish I think, like right before switching universities for example, because it was needed and I was outside alot then and being ok I guess.

I'm kinda scared to go seek help and they just say; you're just overexegerating or smth, idk why I think that. Because idk if I really have it bad, idk when I have it that bad, that I need to search help I guess?

I struggle alot with university rn, I have exams, but I am not doing anything (not studying). I don't feel like I wanna do this anymore even though I have switched  2 times already, I got one thing I wanna do tho, but that still needs work and I can't start with doing that fulltime atm. (but I will achieve my goal one day)

I also got bad medical news about a family member...

I overthink every aspect of life almost, I tend to lose interest in things by doing that too, because I think what is even the point in this?

I don't go outside very much, but some periods I do.

I feel easily irritable and kinda unstable sometimes maybe. (like I hop around to different feelings maybe idk)

Most of my day is spent in my bedroom.

I also feel like I am super sensitive.

And I have no real life friends anymore atm, also because I need to find people on the same wavelength.

And it looks like when alot of stress is around I search an escape in things that aren't that good (not drugs tho).

All in all: Idk what I really feel... and it feels like it goes on for a long period, then it goes off for a little and then it comes back (I'm not sure tho, cuz it could be cause I had to choose a new uni and that could have just felt like it was ok)

I sometimes think of and imagine a woman

Taller than me,

Stronger than me,

Long hair,

Emotionally mature,

I imagine her cuddling me in her arms, sometimes basically spooning me.

I feel cozy under the sheets.

I imagine her talking to me,

Comforting me,

Telling me that everything will be okay,

Slipping away all my worries.

Telling me reasons as to why I'm suicidal and depressed.

Telling me that its okay if I feel crazy.

Telling me that its okay that I can no longer remember anything from my past.

Because it doesn't matter when she's here.

Because she loves me...

And she will never let me be harmed again..



I sometimes turn around to try and hug her back.


I want to make her feel like I care.

Then I feel nothing.

My arms whiff and hit the pillow.

Back to being alone.

And realizing the existential dread of my fate.

What im fated to always be and what ill end up being.


Alone and Insane, until I commit suicide in an alleyway.. or die from shooting myself..

An existence that was pointless,

And a personality just as worthless...

,depression,"I think this time I’m just going to give the complete unabridged version, in detail, even the things I’ve done wrong. If you hate me, hate me. I’m no saint, I’ve done my fair share of hurting and toxicity. I deserve my place in hell, I won’t deny it. If you’re easily offended, disturbed, or want to criticize me, save it and scroll.

When I was a kid (7?) my dad dipped out for cigarettes and that was that, there’s probably damage there but fuck him, I’ve dragged myself into homeownership at 25 on my own. When I was 15 my mom passed away of cancer. I know that fucked my head up, I know I’m not normal, I know my heart doesn’t operate like everyone else’s. In the words of Papa Roach, I’ve got a jet black heart, it’s all fucked up and it’s falling apart. 

When I finally got through the bullying and harassment that comes with growing up and graduating in Yee-Yee country I tried to go to College, god damn that was a terrible choice cause I didn’t try, I was forced into it. I wanted to take my inheritance and buy a house my “family” talked me out of it. I met this girl we’ll call her L. She was the first nail in my coffin. L told me how much she liked me, we slept together, skipped classes and smoked pot, let it be known, I did this so much I don’t remember what I went to college for. One day, a truth came out, I was the side piece, there was hell to pay, not from her but from my liver, famous words of mine “Jack straight, no chaser, none of that pussy shit.” This wasn’t shots, this was straight from the bottle, lean back and chug all weekend till you don’t feel shit but your body collapse to the ground. 

Weed, acid, alcohol became my life until late 2016, I had lost my license cause weed is “bad” but I met a girl, we’ll call her N. Fuck where do I begin? She was amazing at the time, I loved N, but she didn’t like weed, and even though it helps my depression, she wouldn’t have it eventually we broke up, I then proceeded to save money to buy a house, I drank, fucked, snorted, and tripped my way through 2018-2019. In the words of Oli Sykes, This shit ain’t heavy metal. Do you even love me anymore? 

It’s 2019, and god damn these cracks are starting to show, I started seeing a girl at work, her name was A. Fuck A. I hope she suffers a fate worse than death. A went through some stuff before us, she gave up a baby. but she felt the closest I had felt to home in so long. I trusted her, Alligator Tears, there is no soul inside that wretch. She lied, manipulated, and stabbed me in the back. Told me she thought she was pregnant knowing damn well she wasn’t, fucked another dude, and ran off with him, all while telling me how great I was. She drove me to the bathtub with a knife, a camera, and a bottle of vodka. I recorded the whole thing, she did this, she was going to watch the consequences for her choices. I’m no saint, I’m the god damn villain. 

A couple months after that, another girl came along, things were great until one day, she broke up with me and all she had to say for herself was “ I’m the asshole, you didn’t do anything wrong.” I swore from that moment, in 2020 I was going to find my person, I was going to get my happy ending cause at this point I don’t feel like I can be loved.

It’s 2020, N came back and you know what she had to say for herself after I drove an hour out of the way to go see her and cheer her up with a blowing up engine after she got left, We talk off and on and one day she tells me, “I’m sorry the spark isn’t there anymore, I’m dating a drug dealer now, isn’t that funny.” I was so enraged. I burnt everything she ever gave me that I held onto. Burnt it all to the ground. Fuck you. 

My birthday is in two days and what do I have to show for my goal, my New Years resolution to move on and start my next chapter, to let go and do all the shit I miss like cuddling and going on adventures? I’m not shit too anyone, no one puts in time to get to know me, I know I don’t operate the same way, I know I shoot straight and will tell you day one, we aren’t friends, I’m only here to date. I know what I want but it doesn’t matter, no fucks are given, my feelings don’t matter, if I get hurt, good do it, the thing that she really wants is right around the corner, Stab me in the back and slit my throat, let the blood run down my neck, according to the universe I deserve this hell. I don’t want to hurt people, I just want my person cause A got hers and she left me to die. Karma didn’t rip everything from her.

Hi everyone,

I am an 18-year-old boy graduating from high school this year. To make it easier for you to understand my problem, I will summarize my story.

I managed to get into the best secondary school in the whole province. I met new people quickly and I got assimilated. I really like science subjects, such as mathematics or computer science. I don't like the humanities, so I don't put too much effort into it, but the teachers like me because I often help them with the Office software.

However, I do not like how the school affects the atmosphere at home. I remember that since I crossed the threshold of elementary school, I was rewarded for bringing a good grade, but for any failures in education my parents responded with distance, they often told me I was stupid and I would not achieve anything in my life. They often ridiculed me at family gatherings and scored the smallest of offenses with a precision worthy of Sherlock Holmes. It was embarrassing but, in such case, I used to go out with my cousins and play with them. It still hurt, but the joy of meeting them overshadowed the feeling of rejection.

In secondary school, I learned to draw with colorful drawing inks. Since I can remember, I've liked people, but I feel the best spending time at my desk equipped with ink, pencils, and terrible amounts of paper :) I remember that one of my first successful drawings was a portrait of Steve Clark, guitarist of Def Leppard. I showed this drawing to my dad, he reacted: ""You would learn English better instead of drawing crap"". It hurt me. Evaluation of the drawing is a subjective thing, and this one was technically OK because I have already mastered the proportions. He might not have liked it anyway but I was saddened because he didn't even look at it and he got pissed off because I boasted about something unrelated to the school.

Before the secondary school final exams, I was scared by my parents that I wouldn't pass them and it would be a miracle if they accepted me to a vocational school. I was happy and angry with my parents when it turned out that I had one of the best results in the province.

In turn, I have often heard from my mother that I should be grateful for her dedication. I always thanked her for preparing meals - it costs nothing and is very nice. However, she sometimes blamed me for not guessing that I was supposed to vacuum the room or something like that. I never knew what to answer, so I offered her to give me a vacuum cleaner, and then I could do it for her. Usually, then I heard that I was hopeless and I could not be counted on.

And here is the first problem: I can't deal with problems that are connected with emotions. I can solve a purely technical problem, write a program, whatsoever, but I will ignore the feelings of others because they tire me out, suck the energy I need to find a solution. How to deal with such a situation? I will be grateful for advice or links to helpful articles.

Let’s go for the blow. The first crisis happened shortly after high school has begun. Despite keeping in touch with classmates, I felt incredibly lonely and unwanted by anyone (my parents…?). Then I started to hear from them every day that if I don't pass the final exams, they will kick me out and I won't go to any studies. I felt so damn anxious this time! I lost interest in everything else then, and after getting ready for school, I spent the rest of my time lying in bed or watching anime on my laptop.

And I think this is where I made a mistake because I spent a month plunging into a negative internal dialogue. I don't want to blame any of my parents, but it was probably influenced by my mother who is very neurotic and start “solving” any problem by weaving black scenarios instead of facing up the difficulties.

I came back to drawing and playing the guitar. I threw away books, movies, and games because not only did they not give me joy but also had negative associations as a tool to escape from the world. Instead, I prefer walking in the woods, drawing more, and playing guitar instead of just soaking up the content.

I am very hurt by my parents' lack of support. I know a lot of people who love to discuss with me about drawing, math, modeling in Blender, or writing code. I meet passionate and warm people on my way.

But none of these people are members of my family!

I feel rejected by my parents. I often recall the words of my mother who said that I was a planned child but still regrets that she gave birth to me. How can I accept rejection? How to build a happy relationship with my parents despite being hurt?

The parents' behaviors for sure is due to the fact that my mother is the child of an alcoholic and was beaten by her mother. Also, my dad grew up practically alone because my grandparents took care of my uncle who was hit by a car. What can I advise them to help themselves?

I know that I am not responsible for two adults, but so far no one has taken the step to build a healthy family relationship. When I go to visit my friends, I always have the opportunity to spend some time with their parents and most of them are really cool people who treat me... like a human being. I probably have an incomplete picture of the situation - after all, I do not live there. However, I have never encountered such a cold as at my family home.

In early September I met a girl. She caught my eye so I asked her culturally... Well, I was supposed to have a lesson but we talked to each other for a good half hour. X is a very empathic person who shares interests and worldview with me. I see her not only as a partner but also as a best friend. She says that she likes staying with me. She says that she wants to meet me and that I am important to her. She is 4 years younger but still very emotionally mature. Officially, we are not a couple, but X lets me touch her and hold her hand, also she takes me into account in her plans.

I think this relationship has a chance of success. The question is what to do to build a happy relationship with her? How to work through destructive schemes and not build your own relationships based on them?

I will raise an important issue that was omitted at the beginning: why am I writing in a thread about depression? Just a month ago I didn't want to get out of bed but I felt remorse having a lot of things to do. And school. I was forced to take care of myself and to exercise. Everything that had previously given me joy became a filler between the time I spent in bed. Sometimes I felt terrible fear, I had nightmares.

I am not going to play self-diagnosis. Unfortunately, because of the lockdown, so far, I have no way to go to a psychologist, I can start thinking about it next year. Lithium orotate helped me to return to normal activities, thanks to it I can sleep and I do not have panic attacks. Earlier I took Xanax, which I accidentally found in the first aid kit, for my sleep and anxiety problems. It was irresponsible and unethical (after all, one of the family members needed this medicine and I used it up... I don’t know who) but I felt so crushed by the fear that I took those pills in my darkest moments.

I never wanted or tried to kill myself but I can't handle my emotions. I know that they are needed but it is painful for me to experience them. I want to cry, but I can't. As soon as a tear comes out of my eyes I can hear my father's voice in my head ""Don't cry like a woman"".

But pills are not the solution. I know where the problem lies. In my sick family relationships. The question is, what can I do until I go to the psychologist? How can I cope when exercise, keeping a diary, diet and walks do not improve my mood? How do I deal with the feeling of rejection?

If you have survived to this moment, I am incredibly grateful to you. These are not empty words; I really feel what I am writing. Thank you all for your help, I hope that your advice will prove helpful. Take care of yourself.

,depression,"Hey everyone, so as my name suggests I'm a hungarian guy struggling with some dark things lately. It might not seem a big deal at first, and I'm sure there are people, who goes through tougher times, but this shit makes me lose my mind almost. Disclaimer: sorry, if my english is broken here and there, hungarian is my first language

So I have a friend, who happens to be a girl, and I caught deep feelings for her. When we first started talking, I didn't make anything of it, because I was interested in someone else, and I looked at her as someone way above my category (yeah I struggle with self esteem badly).  
A solid half a year went by and we estabilished a great friendship. I got turned off by this other girl and she helped me cope with this, she was really helpful. As we talked, I wouldn't say I developed feelings for a while, I sometimes thought about her, but nothing much.  
There was a turning point around april of 2019. We have a same circle of friends, because we study in the same university, and after a night of drinking she made out (only kissing) with another guy, and it turned out, she caught feelings for the guy. Now that wasn't the turning point itself, but when we talked about it after. She mentioned that the main reason, she fell in love with him, is that he cared about her so much during the exam period. Now that very sentence flipped the tables as I felt that I was the one who cared about her the most.

I had the reason to think this. You must know that she is a very interesting character, and because she is the first person of this kind that I ever encountered I learned a lot because of her. Since we first started talking, she always presented a heartbreakingly low self esteem (like she always said she is fat, nobody likes her, she is not enough) and I always wrote like long texts explaining why she isn't right, she really valuable and looks amazing. I was SIMPing really hard haha (and as I said, because she was the first person of this kind that I've ever met, I thought this is the way to handle stuff like this, to compliment her). I didn't know at the time, that too much SIMPing is a huge turnoff for like more than half of girls. So I got frustrated, when she said she fell in love with the other guy because of his caring, because I felt like I was the one who was always there for her, why can't she love.

And this is where it started to go downhill for me personally. I started to develop deeper and deeper feelings for her, while she was complaining about the other guy not wanting her. She made out with another guy during this, which made suffer increasingly. At that period I still didn't know how to really conquer her heart so I kept just being as nice and caring as I can be.

Now it's time to mention her attitude towards me. She was really really kind and caring for like the first year, always asking me about stuff, and as I'm a huge motorsports fan, and I told her that I watch x race and She asked like questions, She seemed to be interested. We talked about all kinds of stuff and we talked like all day long. When I had a thougher depressed episode, and for example I wasn't online for half a day, She asked in the chat like really anxiously If I'm doing ok. While I fell in love in her increasingly She made it even deeper with that kind of caring. I was really happy when I talked with her. Along the way though, I made some mistakes, which made her lost a bit of interest and caring. Like when she was excited about some celebrity gala, I hadn't show that kind of interest that she showed for my motorsport stuff. The other example was that, when I go home from a drinking night out, she always texted me that ""Text me, when you got home safe"" and I texted this a couple of times to her too, but there were one occasion when I forgot to do it, and it felt really bad for her, I hurt her with that. There were some other smaller ones too. Since these incidents she hasn't show this kind of caring, and I miss it soooo terribly much I can't even explain.

So back to the main part, and this is where it gets ""exciting"". She did a thing that is absolutely unacceptable to me. The main story is that she got to know a guy twice her age, who is a married family man, with two kids. The guy is a frickin bad person, he told her that yea he cheats on her wife, but his wife knows about it and she is okay with that. Yeah, give me a break, who believes this kind of bullshit. Well, my friend did, and this guy lied his way into her, and they've been having sex regularly ever since. Now when before it all happened, and I tried to warn her, that it is really not good to do something like this, because if you take part in cheating, is really immoral I think (I know what I'm talking about, my last relationship ended because I got cheated on). When I tried to warn her, that this guy is not honest, I was attacked brutally, and we can say very toxically. She said that I'm judging her, I'm complaining about her happiness and shit. I said this is not the case, I just think she got misled, and taking part in cheating is really bad. But she kept on saying that Its not about that, this is perfectly fine, why I call out her when other do the same and shit. I was extremely disappointed in her, and I was also unsuprisingly  frustrated that she chooses this fuckin cheater instead of me. She eventually caught feelings for this freakin fella, and although there were some red flags, she wouldn't let him go.

So at this point I started to feel like I might lose interest, which I thought is good. She had some arguments about her f-ed up relationship but eventually we didn't really talked about it after a while. I felt I have the chance that I could let her go, and my feelings for her. But guess what, after all of this shit, I just caught feelings for her again, and even more deeply. I absolutely can not figure out how and why, because she wasn't that caring anymore what I loved about her and she was still in this situation with the married guy. In this summer my feelings were the deepest, and dont laugh at me, but I started to watch like how to get out of friendzone videos and stuff. We joke a lot, so I sometimes threw in like a flirty joke and it didn't really work out well. She seemed like she started to move away from me, and we talked about whats wrong, and she said I made her uncomfortable at times, and of course, she said the flirty joke examples. From this particular argument although I got out better, because she handled the whole conflict in a really childish way, like when I said we should talk she gave excuses because like how i framed a sentence and shit, and I eventually lost interest talking it through. After a couple of days tho, she texted me, and we talked ever since.

But the problem just cant go away, I have really really deep feelings for her. And along the way I got really depressed because of this. I realized that in the beginning I should have gave it a shot, and we might have started dating at the time. I should have given her more excitment and interest in those incidents back in the day. I shouldn't have SIMPed that much. And as I realized my mistakes, I'm really mad at myself. I'm a person who is full of anxiety, so it takes an extra toll on me. I just love her so much man, I cant even describe. I know, that the caring and loving person is not lost, but she only shows it to the person, who she is in love with, and this frustrates me so much. I know I made some mistakes, I know i was the so called nice guy, who nobody wants, and I know that I should just look for another woman, but I just cant right now, I dont really find anyone attractive anymore other than her. So i have some questions, in which I need advice for badly, because I feel like I'm starting to lose my mind, these feelings eats away me.

1. What should I do to get out of the friendzone with her (if there is a tactic, which can give me hope, just please tell me)
2. If there is no hope whatsoever, then please tell me how to cope with it.
3. How can i get back her caring and interest, if its possible?
4. What should I change, that this shit never happens to me again?
5. Please give me feedback on the whole story, and tell me where I fucked up, or the thing I didn't noticed on the way, or that I was wrong somewhere.

Sorry for the long story, but I thought there might be some people that can help me, and give me hope. I really love her.

I know I made some mistakes, I know i was the so called nice guy, who nobody wants, and I know that I should just look for another woman, but I just cant right now, I dont really find anyone attractive anymore other than her. So i have some questions, in which I need advice for badly, because I feel like I&amp;#39;m starting to lose my mind, these feelings eats away me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I do to get out of the friendzone with her (if there is a tactic, which can give me hope, just please tell me)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is no hope whatsoever, then please tell me how to cope with it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How can i get back her caring and interest, if its possible?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What should I change, that this shit never happens to me again?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please give me feedback on the whole story, and tell me where I fucked up, or the thing I didn&amp;#39;t noticed on the way, or that I was wrong somewhere.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry for the long story, but I thought there might be some people that can help me, and give me hope. I really love her. Thank you for your attention, and for your advice.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"I could go through my entire life story, but that'd be ridiculous so I'll just explain what's been going on recently.

I recently got into a pretty bad argument with my mother. It was a whole lot of bullshit and she was just being an asswipe and overreacting as usual. And I'm not just saying that. But anyway, after that I went and locked myself in my bedroom for the rest of the day. 1 day turned into 2. 2 turned into 3, and here I am, typing away on my keyboard in my bedroom. I've only left my bedroom for minimal food and water to keep me alive, dinner (after everyone finishes so I can eat alone), and to piss and shit. Food isn't even appealing to me anymore. I don't even care to eat and I just see feces when I look in my fridge. I'm used to a grumbling stomach at this point. Haven't seen daylight in 3 days. Just been jerking off, sleeping, listening to music, browsing Reddit and YouTube, and watching livestreams, wasting my life away. I'm on my fall break in college right now so I don't have to worry about homework right now. But well, what 'inspired' me to write this is that I was in my bedroom and somehow managed to grasp the energy to workout slightly just to keep my body from withering away, and I overheard my dickhead mother talking to my fuckface brother about how I've been locked away in my room all day and that I keep doing this. You know what they said? They said all of these rough quotes:

""He keeps waking up at 6 PM and I can never get the bedroom to myself, it's so annoying"" (I share a bedroom with my brother). - brother

""I'm so sick of his shitty sleep schedule"" - mother

And they a couple other douchy things but im forgetting unfortunately. But either way, what really got my attention was that neither one of them seemed concerned whatsoever about my condition. None of them wondered why I was waking up late and locking myself in my bedroom, none of them wondered why I haven't been saying a word at dinner, and none of them have checked on me ONCE. I was just about to grasp the courage to leave my bedroom and grab some food, but I think I'm gonna sit here and starve now. Fuck these people. I can't believe I'm gonna be stuck with these people for several more years.

Distracting myself barely even helps. I was on voicechat with friends laughing my ass off yesterday, and the moment I got off I immediately felt empty and depressed again. Even my dreams lately have been shit, and they're usually alright. My dreams all consisted of the events that went down recently. Music has been keeping me sane, I have songs infinitely playing so that I don't have dark thoughts to make me want to die even more than I already do.

My family knows full well that im depressed and they dont even give a fucking shit. Oh and my mom told me 3 days ago that I'm an asshole and that I disgust her, so there's that. Thanks mom, you really make me feel loved. Maybe you'll regret what you said when I finally get pushed over the fucking edge one day and tie a noose.

,depression,"I’ve been depressed since 15. I grew up in an absolutely broken and abusive home in the middle of no where. I’ve been punched in the face for crying by my mom, and well also by myself. I’m a runner. I ran to college, then I ran even further, overseas. I’ve traveled all around the world. I’ve lived in 4 countries. I worked so so hard to get where I am now, a small island in SE Asia because I fell in love with it 5 years ago, but sometimes when you get to your biggest dreams, you realize it’s not at all what you want. I live with my boyfriend, who is a native of the island. He’s just an asshole. We rarely even talk. He’s unemployed and I really think I’m being used for money. I spend at least 98% of my week alone inside my home as I also work from home. There aren’t many expats here and the depression spell I’ve been in the past few years is so much different than anything I’ve had before. I’m completely numb and sometimes I even miss waking up and feeling the heaviness on my chest as at least then I felt alive. I have 2 friends here, but neither are close enough to even know I’m so depressed. I feel so lost. I’m only 27, but see no future for my life as I feel so stuck here. I’m responsible for so many people (financially) that I shouldn’t even hold responsibility for, yet no one takes care of me. So many people from my little town are so proud of me. They think I’m so brave and adventurous, but really I’m just running.

I grew up in an absolutely broken and abusive home in the middle of no where. I’ve been punched in the face for crying by my mom, and well also by myself. I’m a runner. I ran to college, then I ran even further, overseas. I’ve traveled all around the world. I’ve lived in 4 countries. I worked so so hard to get where I am now, a small island in SE Asia because I fell in love with it 5 years ago, but sometimes when you get to your biggest dreams, you realize it’s not at all what you want. I live with my boyfriend, who is a native of the island. He’s just an asshole. We rarely even talk. He’s unemployed and I really think I’m being used for money. I spend at least 98% of my week alone inside my home as I also work from home. There aren’t many expats here and the depression spell I’ve been in the past few years is so much different than anything I’ve had before. I’m completely numb and sometimes I even miss waking up and feeling the heaviness on my chest as at least then I felt alive. I have 2 friends here, but neither are close enough to even know I’m so depressed. I feel so lost. I’m only 27, but see no future for my life as I feel so stuck here. I’m responsible for so many people (financially) that I shouldn’t even hold responsibility for, yet no one takes care of me. So many people from my little town are so proud of me. They think I’m so brave and adventurous, but really I’m just running. It doesn’t matter where in the world I am, the darkness never leaves, of course by what people see they would never ever know the state I’ve been in for so long.

Whenever i come home or go to bed (especially when going to bed), brief moments of the day come back to my memory but it feels like it was all fake because how I behave during the day contrasts so much with how I really feel inside.

It’s when being faced with myself that looking back it all looks like a lie, like I’ve just been putting a mask on without realising it.

I feel guilty to be so self-centered, unable to do even the simplest things, unable to just simply live life like everybody else.

,depression,"My day was shit and I feeling really sad

I have a crush on this girl and I have social anxiety so it’s kinda hard for me to talk to people in person. So I dm her on Instagram about her stories and stuff and she always took a long time to reply and sometimes no reply at all. Everyone said that she isn’t interested (everyone is people from the internet) and I accepted that but I have no friends so I said to myself I’ll try to become her friend. Their was a few days she was out of school and she hates science so she dmed me first asking for the homework and I was really happy (this was last week and this week) so I was thinking that hey maybe we could be friends she went to me for help right? Well I don’t think so, we had a science test today 7th period and 6th period we both have study skills or something like that so I made the plan to ask her if she wanted to study with me. And I actually asked her which I didn’t think I would do. She then said something like I need to read for English class (we also have the same English so I know what homework we have and we had very little) so I was fine with it because she was doing other work. So I gave science a little look and moved on I then look behind me waiting to ask a teacher a question and I look at her iPad and see her writing but for English we didn’t have to write so I had a feeling something was up. I then look again and I see her talking to her friend I think asking for help about protein synthesis (that’s what out test was on) now that got me sad because she really didn’t want to study with me and I had no idea why and her friend doesn’t even take biology so why we she get help from her right? But basically that’s it I’m really sad that she really doesn’t want to talk to me and avoids me. and that’s not the only time she avoided me (I guess you can say avoid) a few other small things happened.

&lt;p&gt;I have a crush on this girl and I have social anxiety so it’s kinda hard for me to talk to people in person. So I dm her on Instagram about her stories and stuff and she always took a long time to reply and sometimes no reply at all. Everyone said that she isn’t interested (everyone is people from the internet) and I accepted that but I have no friends so I said to myself I’ll try to become her friend. Their was a few days she was out of school and she hates science so she dmed me first asking for the homework and I was really happy (this was last week and this week) so I was thinking that hey maybe we could be friends she went to me for help right? Well I don’t think so, we had a science test today 7th period and 6th period we both have study skills or something like that so I made the plan to ask her if she wanted to study with me. And I actually asked her which I didn’t think I would do. She then said something like I need to read for English class (we also have the same English so I know what homework we have and we had very little) so I was fine with it because she was doing other work. So I gave science a little look and moved on I then look behind me waiting to ask a teacher a question and I look at her iPad and see her writing but for English we didn’t have to write so I had a feeling something was up. I then look again and I see her talking to her friend I think asking for help about protein synthesis (that’s what out test was on) now that got me sad because she really didn’t want to study with me and I had no idea why and her friend doesn’t even take biology so why we she get help from her right? But basically that’s it I’m really sad that she really doesn’t want to talk to me and avoids me. and that’s not the only time she avoided me (I guess you can say avoid) a few other small things happened. Like does she dislike me? I already think people don’t really like me but I always thought that it’s just me saying that to myself and I’m not as bad as I think but now I do think I’m as bad as I think and it makes me really sad. I should also add that I’m not explaining the emotions I’m feeling well it’s worse then it sounds&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"A lot has happened in 2020, as we all know too well. It's been a shit year.

To add to this: My grandmother is dying and its heartbreaking to watch my family be so distressed. I have friends who need some time away from me due to me taking my anxieties out on them when we lived together. I feel terrible and very guilty for hurting my friends when I did not realise I was doing this. I got into a relationship that I was so happy in, only to be broken up with later in the year. All solidify the thoughts in my mind that I'm a horrible mess of a person that nobody wants to be around.

My friends are all kinda growing up &amp; apart - we don't see eachother much anymore, even out of lockdown &amp; pandemic - relationships getting more serious, friends moving abroad, spending more time with their partners and on their own careers and lives. I understand it, but it doesn't make things easier. Even when it comes to my most amazing couple of friends - I can tell that they are tired of hearing my problems. I feel alone, unwanted and like people are sick of my shit. I apologise to people for even saying a sentence sometimes.

Anxiety &amp; depression have been on and off in my life like a high school couple for the last nine years, but never as strong as this. I am 28 now. I feel like I've achieved nothing. I went back to university at 23, graduated a year ago and am now doing a masters on top of my job. I can't do it. I can't even motivate myself to sit and do research.  I lie on my bed with a blanket over me watching crap shows on my days off when I knew I should be working and researching for college work, then I feel intense guilt for not being able to do it. Sometimes I feel ok and sometimes my friends want to see me. Other times I won't see anyone for a week. People are too busy for me., then I feel like I'm annoying them by asking them to meet. I've been to talk therapy, cbt and on meds over and over. I always think they work at the time, but then realise that I never really learnt much as I struggle with myself over and over. I've tried the meditation, the journaling.

I'm waking up each day since the break-up with a knot in my stomach and a beating chest. It was really the straw that broke the camel's back. I realise that i's not him I miss or I crave, but that it really just compounded all of my feelings of worthlessness. I cry too much. I can't stop eating, then sometimes my stomach growls at me but I can't bring myself to get up and cook. I am not interested in anything anymore. I have motivation for life and I hate this. I am struggling to see any positives in my life. I am experiencing psychomatic symptoms from anxiety - I have a hernia. Even simple tasks like washing clothes or showering require a lot of mental energy and a pep talk. I just want to be normal again.

I am in the middle of over-the-phone counselling, but it's not working. What type of therapy worked for people here who have experienced these type of feelings?

,depression,"So a few things for background: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half and we live together. He’s had issues with depression since childhood and has been diagnosed with major depression. He IS getting help. 

A few times a year he has very serious depressive episodes, during which he can barely function. These can last from a week to a month. This is made harder by the fact that he works 60-hour weeks doing manual labor at a factory. When he gets home from work during one of these episodes he either goes to sleep immediately or will watch the same movie over and over. If I cook something and put it on a plate and bring it to him he’ll eat it, but if I don’t literally put food in front of him he won’t eat. 

I genuinely don’t mind helping him when he’s having an episode. From my perspective he is sick, and you take care of your loved ones when they’re sick. 

But one thing I haven’t been able to find a way to help him with is basic hygiene. He’ll rarely shower, or brush his teeth during his depressive spells.

TW: SELF HARM, SUICIDE ATTEMPT
So let’s start off like this:
Hello, my name is Dora (nickname). Starting in 7th grade I started to struggle with depression, not exactly sure how it came on but it happened fast. Suddenly I went from the sweet girl who cared about everyone to being self conscious, beating myself up for not getting 100%, and just blaming myself for things I couldn’t even control. This triggered severe anxiety, which is something a 13 year old should never have to deal with. I started self harm in the 7th grade as well, I guess it was kind of a trend as weird as that sounds; in my mind it was nothing serious because everyone else was doing it so I couldn’t be that bad right? Wrong. I have so many scars and they destroyed my body image, I have to live with them forever now. Let’s skip forward to 8th grade, my depression kind of went away but my anxiety was still high. I got through the year easy, no drama, I made a ton of new friends, and was having fun until everything hit me like a train. I was suspended and I lost every last friend, my entire grade hated me. That’s when everything fell apart rapidly, my depression came back only this time it was even worse, my anxiety skyrocketed, I went from being able to bottle my emotions to being an emotional wreck and crying over the simplest of things, well I mean what else was I supposed to do? I was hated by everyone. I started self harm again, hardcore. I started planning my suicide, the day, how I would do it, and I was always perfecting it to make sure nothing goes wrong and that I won’t survive and be miserable. I decided to wait until the summer so nobody would pretend to care about me, and the only one I’d be hurting is myself. That was until I met him, (I’m going to call him Mateo for privacy), I had known Mateo since 5th grade and we were friends but when school let out our friendship sky rocketed, he was the only friend I had, and I fell in love with him. But I shouldn’t I told myself, I tried pushing him away but I didn’t back down, I tried my best to ignore him but he always caught my eye. He was helping but I didn’t know it yet, so I figured out how to push him a little so I wouldn’t worry about him being hurt over my suicide. Skip forward to June, maybe July. I was still hated by everyone and I loved Mateo but I couldn’t hold onto him, so once my family went to bed I grabbed the right pill amount and a knife. I picked up my knife and slit my wrist, then I just as I was able to down the pills Mateo called me. Something that night told me to answer besides I suppose I owed him a final goodbye, but that phone call didn’t go the way I expected. When I picked up he was really happy and went on talking about stuff, asking how I was, and bringing up fun we had during school a couple months ago. I didn’t tell him what I was doing but I threw the pills away, cleaned up my bloody wrist and layed in bed as he talked to me for the next 6 hours. In the following months I got a lot better and in fact for the first time in three years I want to live and I’m excited for the future... my future with him. That’s right, I’m still in love with him and actually he likes me too but we are taking things very slowly.

He was helping but I didn’t know it yet, so I figured out how to push him a little so I wouldn’t worry about him being hurt over my suicide. Skip forward to June, maybe July. I was still hated by everyone and I loved Mateo but I couldn’t hold onto him, so once my family went to bed I grabbed the right pill amount and a knife. I picked up my knife and slit my wrist, then I just as I was able to down the pills Mateo called me. Something that night told me to answer besides I suppose I owed him a final goodbye, but that phone call didn’t go the way I expected. When I picked up he was really happy and went on talking about stuff, asking how I was, and bringing up fun we had during school a couple months ago. I didn’t tell him what I was doing but I threw the pills away, cleaned up my bloody wrist and layed in bed as he talked to me for the next 6 hours. In the following months I got a lot better and in fact for the first time in three years I want to live and I’m excited for the future... my future with him. That’s right, I’m still in love with him and actually he likes me too but we are taking things very slowly. Oh and btw I did tell him about that night a couple months later and he was so upset, not at me but by the fact that he could have lost me.&lt;/p&gt;

Last month was officially one year since I graduated from university. I barely remember being there.

I don't have a job, I have no motivation, I have nothing and nobody, I feel nothing.

I have a lot of unhealed scars from my childhood, I was physically and mentally abused by my stepdad. Neglected and rejected by my real mother before being placed for adoption. My adoptive mother died, my foster brother took his own life and left a note blaming me because he thought his mum loved me more than him.

My new dad didn't want anything to do with me and said I was cursed, to him, I killed his wife and son. I ran away and was homeless for most of my 20's. I've never had real friends, I've never let anyone close to me. Are these excuses? Probably. These things were so long ago that I barely remember anymore.

I push anybody that tries to get close to me away. I don't want anything, I just want to be left alone, or do I? I spend all day playing video games because when I don't, I have to face reality and it hurts.

I'm 32 now. It's pathetic. I live in a small home on my own, it's very cheap but very quiet and lonely.

I can't snap out of this spiral of misery on misery. I don't know what I'm doing or why, so I do nothing. Then I feel guilt or shame, the thought of seeing anybody I used to know and it gets worse.

The world is just grey to me, I see people smile and laugh, I laugh back but I have no idea what they're saying or laughing at. I don't care, I just want to feel the way they do.

I remember I went to therapy once and he asked me how I feel, I've never felt much of anything.

Why am I writing this? Am I depressed? I don&amp;#39;t think so. Hard to think.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Hello. I'm in my early twenties and I am a beginner programmer. About a month ago I received a job offer to join a new startup company as a junior programmer.

They said that I'll start there as a temp for a probationary period and based on my work they'll decide if I'll be signing for a permanent position with them. The job is a remote job, and the offered payment is okay. The managers are nice and thoughtful. Overall it's a job with good terms.

But, the issue here is not on the company side, it is me. I am diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Social Anxiety Disorder. That affects my work in multiple levels.

For example, I am getting stressful in meetings and I often try to avoid them in the first place. When I do attend meetings, I don't talk. Or, when I get tasked to do something, and there's a very tight deadline, I start to get panicked and stressed about not being able to make it.

So I'm thinking about leaving this job. When I talked to my family about this, they said that because of the good terms, I should keep it, suck it up and adapt. They say that it is a good starting point for my career. And I agree with them, and I know that if I leave this job, I probably won't be able to find something with as good terms as this. And that I won't be able to save money for later in my life. But on the other hand, as I said, I don't feel good with myself. I get stressed and anxious.

I do love the line of job that I chose, when I work on my own projects in my own terms, I am more calm and relaxed.

So this is where I am stuck now. On one hand, I'm scared of staying, because this condition might get worse, and it may be too late to leave, and it may come to a point where I'm sick of this job I won't want to do anything related to it anymore, but on the other hand, I don't know if there's anything better for me right now.

I'd appreciate some advice on this please.

,depression,"Throw away account because I'm not really comfortable sharing this on my main, I've only really spoken openly about this to my mom. Basically I can tell that my mental health has plummeted during the past two years, and I think it might be depression. I'm not entirely sure though and I'm a college student who comes from a unstable financial background, meaning I have no money for insurance. I relied on medicaid until I was too old, and haven't been able to get stable insurance yet. It really sucks because I think I might have it, but I also don't want to self diagnose because I know it might be harmful in the long run. I figured it wouldn't hurt posting about my symptoms here, just in case someone might be able to help me out. I know it's not wise to turn to the internet for help with your mental health, but I don't really know what else to do. I'm really bad at explaining my feelings, but here are a few reasons why I think I might be depressed:

1.) I'm extremely unmotivated. Not only in a lazy way (like not wanting to clean or exercise), but also emotionally. I don't have fun doing anything I used to enjoy. For example; I love video games, they have always been helpful in cheering me up. Here lately I just don't even feel like reaching for the controller anymore, which is weird because I know that I miss the feeling of playing them. The same goes for other forms of entertainment. I can think of very few anime, TV shows, or Youtube videos I've actually enjoyed watching in the past few months.

2.) This one is still on the topic of being unmotivated, but in a different sense. I don't want to leave my room for anything. I simply haven't had the energy to go anywhere, or to converse with my family. I am an introvert, so at first I thought I was just a bit socially drained, but it has been months of this.

3.) This parts a little gross, but honestly my personal hygiene has really gone down hill. I used to be a fairly well taken care of person, but lately I have not been feeling like taking care of myself. Won't go into detail, but it's honestly really embarrassing. Same goes for keeping my room clean.

4.) I often feel random waves of sadness wash over me. It happens a lot, and sometimes in inconvenient times where I just have to swallow it until I get home. Honestly crying really helps with this part, it's good stress relief.

5.) I have negative thoughts about myself a lot, and I'm scared that everyone secretly hates me. I've also had thoughts about being better off dead, however I don't think about committing suicide or self harming. These thoughts are more like ""my family would be better off if _____"".

6.) I get full nights of sleep and somehow still manage to feel tired. I also find myself dazing off quite often, and unable to concentrate. 

Now I'm not saying I haven't been happy in the past two years, but more like I'm sad way too much. I wouldn't say my symptoms are severe- I definitely know my mental health could be worse, but I still dont like feeling this way.

,depression,"Few times a year, at completely random times, I get these what I call good/happy energy hours. When I feel I could do everything - conquer the whole world even -  and there is nothing to stop me. Seriously, at such times there is almost nothing that would stop it and make it go away, but unfortunately after a while it goes away by itself and my mood switches back to - what I already consider normal after all those years - mix of neutral and depressed state, nihilistic even.


I was trying to figure out what triggered these ""good hours"", from going back to what I did, ate (I'm tracking my food), how much hours I slept, what happened and so on, to replicate it somehow, but I was not able to trigger or force it anyhow. It just comes itself from time to time and goes away after few hours (I guess due tiredness eventually).
I thought it has a lot to do with diet and being rested after good nights sleep, but nope. No matter what I ate or how much I slept that day or before, it always came out of the blue, which is really strange, interesting and rather frustrating at the same time.


I wish I could trigger this every day for at least few hours (preferably outside of work, hah), because I'm tired of feeling tired and depressed most of the time. I get that everybody feels tired from time to time and have those ""lazy days"", feeling like not doing anything, and that nobody is happy 24/7 - even though some celebrities are portayed that way and some people seem like they are.

,depression,"I can't remember being stable or feeling unprovoked happiness, but for most of my childhood I had hobbies and passions to keep me occupied, until senior year of high school. I remember a swift change happening in my personality over the course of just a couple weeks. I kinda lost all my fight and barely graduated.

I spent a couple years at a community college a few miles down the road, working on a music degree and generally just doing the bare minimum to survive. It was shortly before I dropped out in 2018 that I finally told my doctor something felt wrong psychologically.

2 years, 4 therapists, and countless med switches later, I've found that depression is the least of my worries. I spent the longest time thinking it was normal to need some time to cry every day. After all of this treatment my breakdowns are no less common and I've pushed several friends and loved ones to their limits... and honestly, I'm surprised that I'm still here after a quarter-century of either struggling to live every day, or wishing I didn't have to.

In 2020 I've faced the horror of the only employer I've stayed with for any long term teetering on the brink of collapse since they can't operate during the pandemic. I've come to terms with the prospect of there not even being peace where I live by the time business as usual can resume. It's been since New Year's Day that I've even had a fuckin hug, man. I've resisted the urge to cope in any dangerous or unlawful ways, but I feel just as far gone as the people in my community that have OD'd in the last few years. I try to take some of the edge off with some hard cider, but I can't bring myself to get drunk enough to feel happy; alcohol took someone important from me and I don't want to go out that way.

Truth be told, I don't know what convinced me to type this all out. I suppose it's a damn pity party, at least in part. I suppose what I'm trying to say with all of this is... sometimes, it really is too late for someone to save themselves, and some tunnels don't come out the other side. But even if I'm miserable every single day for another 40 or 50 years, I'm gonna face it, because part of my horrible mental health comes from the trauma of losing someone because they drowned in their struggles.

I spent the longest time thinking it was normal to need some time to cry every day. After all of this treatment my breakdowns are no less common and I&amp;#39;ve pushed several friends and loved ones to their limits... and honestly, I&amp;#39;m surprised that I&amp;#39;m still here after a quarter-century of either struggling to live every day, or wishing I didn&amp;#39;t have to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2020 I&amp;#39;ve faced the horror of the only employer I&amp;#39;ve stayed with for any long term teetering on the brink of collapse since they can&amp;#39;t operate during the pandemic. I&amp;#39;ve come to terms with the prospect of there not even being peace where I live by the time business as usual can resume. It&amp;#39;s been since New Year&amp;#39;s Day that I&amp;#39;ve even had a fuckin hug, man. I&amp;#39;ve resisted the urge to cope in any dangerous or unlawful ways, but I feel just as far gone as the people in my community that have OD&amp;#39;d in the last few years. I try to take some of the edge off with some hard cider, but I can&amp;#39;t bring myself to get drunk enough to feel happy; alcohol took someone important from me and I don&amp;#39;t want to go out that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Truth be told, I don&amp;#39;t know what convinced me to type this all out. I suppose it&amp;#39;s a damn pity party, at least in part. I suppose what I&amp;#39;m trying to say with all of this is... sometimes, it really is too late for someone to save themselves, and some tunnels don&amp;#39;t come out the other side. But even if I&amp;#39;m miserable every single day for another 40 or 50 years, I&amp;#39;m gonna face it, because part of my horrible mental health comes from the trauma of losing someone because they drowned in their struggles. I don&amp;#39;t want to fuck up anybody else that way.&lt;/p&gt;

,depression,"Other people's attitude isn't always my fault.

For a long time if someone gave me attitude or was upset I always blamed my self. Someone would say something with an annoyed or mad tone I would take it personally. I would blame my self, it was my fault that they were mad. Same thing when someone was upset or feeling down. I felt I was letting them down and that I was failing them.

Except it's not my fault. I don't control others, I can only control my self. If they want to be mad about something out of my control then so be them. But I don't need to put my self down because of how they feel.

Another thing I realized is it's okay to be angry at people. I would not allow my self to feel anger at others. I felt that I was responsible for their feelings and so being angry at them for something that was my fault was unjust. But now I realize that I'm not in control of them, and if someone is going to take their anger out on me unjustly then I'm allowed to feel anger back at them.

Now I would like to add that this doesn't give myself or anyone a license to be a dick.

,depression,"As the title says, my dad was pretty absent and became downright abusive once I was 15/16 (I’m a 20 year old male). Around the time he became abusive, I started to become close to an older male high school teacher who I wished could be my dad. We were cool throughout high school but unfortunately don’t talk anymore. 

Once I graduated high school I became close with a family friend (late 40s guy) who seriously took on the role of a father in my life. He’s genuinely one of the most inspiring incredible people I’ve ever met and we’re really really close. I’m not sure what typical father son relationships are like because I didn’t have one with my bio dad, but my family friend and I say I love you to each other and hug each other all the time, so I think we’re closer than most fathers and sons (at least with sons my age). 

I’ve realized that the way I cope with my shitty relationship with my bio dad is by becoming exceptionally close to other older men in my life and hoping they become a father figure. I don’t think there is anything inherently destructive about that coping mechanism in itself, but I have a tendency to get really attached (probably overly so) to these “father figures” to my own detriment.  

Lately with my family friend I’ve been feeling like I’m excessively emotionally invested in the relationship and really needy as a result.

I live under a great roof, I have food, clothes and entertainment but there truly is a huge void in my life and I want to end it. I am suicidal but I do not want to end my life. I wouldn’t have a problem ending it if I had to. I’m okay with dying. 

I live with my mother and two grandparents. My grandmother is the only person in this world who is nice to me and I really don’t know why. My mother despises me, we have spent 10 weeks of the last 3 months not talking. My father took his own life when I was 8, apparently he was an emotionally abusive bully. Last week, my mother told me that I’m a bully just like my father. I don’t know what I have done. I just want to be cared for, I want to feel safe, loved and protected. I just want my only parent to be nice to me. I have no siblings. My grandfather doesn’t like me either, he hasn’t spoken to me in weeks. I don’t know what I’ve done wrong because the rest of my family is completely normal with me. 

Since I can remember, I’ve been severely depressed. I have anxiety and I’m sure I’m bipolar to some extent. I’ve never actually gotten any help for this because I don’t have the motivation and I can’t do it on my own. I’ve tried to hint that I’m not feeling well to some family members hoping for some support or push but nothing, just get told to go out and exercise. I’ve been told by multiple family members that I seem like someone who is really depressed. I fantasise constantly about killing myself and the urge is great, I’ve made several attempts and plans to before but I just can’t do it to my family. I self harm instead, just for now. I constantly obsess about hoping to get a severe illness that would kill me or being seriously injured in an accident. I’m not sure why. I guess I just want something else to kill me rather than it be me who takes my own life. 

I dread waking up in the morning, I waste my day sitting down in front of the tv. There’s not much more I can do right now. I barely get out of the house, I don’t see anyone and I don’t get any healthy socialising. My country is in another lockdown right now. I’ve worked many good jobs. I’m in my third out of four years of studies in University because I’ve been held back two years. I’m taking whatever qualifications I can from this year and that will be it. I can’t waste any more time. I’ve been held back in so many ways due to my mental issues and I can’t explain it. I don’t want to be like this. I feel like a failure in every way imaginable. 

I operate on routine - it is the most important thing in my life because it keeps me going. That has been completely taken from me and I haven’t been able to have any since the start of this year. I can’t deal with the thoughts of going into another year of this bullshit. I never feel good. I’m never happy, my mind is always full of bad thoughts and feelings. I feel like I’ll never escape this. I had high hopes of leaving the country next year to start fresh somewhere else but it seems like that’s not going to happen now with the world we live in today. 

I’ve been considering getting a flight to another country to become homeless and stay there. This way I can run from this hell, responsibilities and hopefully cut my life short by a significant amount of years. I have no sense of direction. I’ve always wanted to be a pilot but that’s another thing that’s been taken - I don’t have that much money to train to be a pilot and in today’s world, pilots are not in demand like they used to be. 

5 years ago, I had thought that by now I would be on my feet and living life. But here I am. A dead man walking. I have been sucked of everything I have inside of me. I hate this world.

,depression,"I know you guys are bored reading similar rants and questions from me.

Preface:

I have chronic fatigue due to chronic stress. I often have  random small wounds on my hands probably due to hypo symptoms (my doc doesn't want to do anything more) It's been 1 month  since starting HRT (MtF) but still nothing obviously.

My depression is intertwined with dysphoria and the only way it comes out is random bursts of rage and tearing up but not crying.

One of my main issues as I see it is ""wasting"" too much time lying in bed during the weekends. I usually do it when I feel crushing sadness and dysphoria. 

I have so much work to do on the PC PhD wise but I'm so exhausted I just want to get under the blankets. I do work alot during the weekdays though.

When I lie down I sometimes think about various things but usually end up sleeping. That doesn't stop me from sleeping during the night.

I ""feel"" I should be working (although technically it's my free time). I can't exercise because I crash (adrenal crash?) . I will feel way worse if I do. Even a brisk hike is often too much.

I try to go for a walk every day but that's about it.  I don't even game because I hate it now. 

Doing something for my dysphoria (wearing women's clothes or painting my nails doesn't do anything). It's like ""yeah so what"".

I am taking a antidepressant and going to a therapist. So far it's too early for the drug to work.

My main question is: should I feel so bad ""wasting"" my time and sleeping? (I actually feel tired).

Another is how to think in a positive way. 

My therapist tells me I need to stop the ""what ifs"" and ""I wish I had tried that"" and give myself credit for what I've done (started laser, HRT...).

I try to do that but when my mind goes to how much my health sucks now. 

Plus that it keeps getting worse.

It's like I can feel I'm slowly dying. I mean we all are but that's not what I mean.

 Then I'm like ""what's the point? I just want to rest. I don't care anymore"".

How to improve in these two aspects?

 Ideally I would lie down until my HRT starts to work and I start to feel a little bit physically better.

&lt;p&gt;I am taking a antidepressant and going to a therapist. So far it&amp;#39;s too early for the drug to work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My main question is: should I feel so bad &amp;quot;wasting&amp;quot; my time and sleeping? (I actually feel tired).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another is how to think in a positive way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My therapist tells me I need to stop the &amp;quot;what ifs&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;I wish I had tried that&amp;quot; and give myself credit for what I&amp;#39;ve done (started laser, HRT...).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I try to do that but when my mind goes to how much my health sucks now. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Plus that it keeps getting worse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s like I can feel I&amp;#39;m slowly dying. I mean we all are but that&amp;#39;s not what I mean.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then I&amp;#39;m like &amp;quot;what&amp;#39;s the point? I just want to rest. I don&amp;#39;t care anymore&amp;quot;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to improve in these two aspects?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally I would lie down until my HRT starts to work and I start to feel a little bit physically better. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#39;s not going to happen though obviously.&lt;/p&gt;
