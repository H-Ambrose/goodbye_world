"Our most-broken and least-understood rules is ""helpers may not invite private contact as a first resort"", so we've made a new wiki to explain it","We understand that most people who reply immediately to an OP with an invitation to talk privately  mean only to help, but this type of response usually leads to either disappointment or disaster.  it usually works out quite differently here than when you say ""PM me anytime"" in a casual social context.  

We have huge admiration and appreciation for the goodwill and good citizenship of so many of you who support others here and flag inappropriate content - even more so because we know that so many of you are struggling yourselves.  We're hard at work behind the scenes on more information and resources to make it easier to give and get quality help here - this is just a small start.  

Our new wiki page explains in detail why it's much better to respond in public comments, at least until you've gotten to know someone.  It will be maintained at /r/depression/wiki/private_contact, and the full text of the current version is below.

*****

###Summary###

**Anyone who, while acting as a helper, invites or accepts private contact (I.e. PMs, chat, or any kind of offsite communication) early in the conversion is showing either bad intentions or bad judgement.  Either way, it's unwise to trust them.** 


""PM me anytime"" seems like a kind and generous offer. And it might be perfectly well-meaning, but, unless and until a solid rapport has been established, it's just not a wise idea.  Here are some points to consider before you offer or accept an invitation to communicate privately.

* **By posting supportive replies publicly, you'll help more people than just the OP. If your responses are of good quality, you'll educate and inspire other helpers.** [The 1-9-90 rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1%25_rule_(Internet_culture\)) applies here as much as it does anywhere else on the internet.  

* People who are struggling with serious mental-health issues often (justifiably) have a low tolerance for disappointment and a high-level of ever-changing emotional need. **Unless the helper is able to make a 100% commitment to be there for them in every way, for as long as necessary, offering a personal inbox as a resource is likely to do more harm than good.** This is why mental-health crisis-line responders usually don't give their names and callers aren't allowed to request specific responders.  It's much healthier and safer for the callers to develop a relationship with the agency as a whole.  Analogously, it's much safer and healthier for our OPs to develop a relationship with the community as a whole.  Even trained responders are generally not allowed to work high-intensity situations alone.  It's partly about availability, but it's mostly about wider perspective and preventing compassion fatigue. 

* **If a helper gets in over their head with someone whose mental-health issues (including suicidality, which is often comorbid with depression) escalate, in a PM conversation it's much harder for others, including the /r/depression and /r/SuicideWatch moderators to help**.  (Contrary to common assumptions, moderators can't see or police PMs.)  

* In our observation over many years, the people who say ""PM me"" the most are consistently the ones with the least understanding of mental-health issues and mental-health support. We all have gaps in our knowledge and in our ability to communicate effectively.  Community input mitigates these limitations. **There's no reason why someone who's truly here to help would want to hide their responses from community scrutiny**.  If helpers are concerned about their own privacy, keep in mind that self-disclosure, when used supportively, is more about the feelings than the details, and that we have no problem here with the use of alt/throwaway accounts, and have no restrictions on account age or karma.  

*  We all know the internet is used by some people to exploit or abuse others.  These people *do* want to hide their deceptive and manipulative responses from everyone except their victims. There are many of them who specifically target those who are vulnerable because of mental-health issues. **If a helper invites an OP to talk privately and gives them a good, supportive experience, they've primed that person to be more vulnerable to abusers.** This sort of cognitive priming tends to be particularly effective when someone's in a state of mental-health crisis, when people rely more on heuristics than critical reasoning.

* If OPs want to talk privately, posting on a wide-open anonymous forum like reddit might not be the best option. Although we don't recommend it, we do allow OPs to request private contact when asking for support. If you want to do this, please keep your expectations realistic, and to have a careful look at the history of anyone who offers to PM before opening up to them.",SQLwitch,175,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/doqwow/our_mostbroken_and_leastunderstood_rules_is/,understand people reply immediately op invitation talk privately mean help type

Is it wierd that i have imaginary friends at the age of 16 (almost 17) ... i feel like the ultimate loser,"16f ... cant manage to make friends and get overwhelmed with online friends :(.

Well i have this teddybear which is a lil bit taller than me and i pretend that he is my imaginary friend (called thao btw... i dunno why) so i watch YouTube videos with him,  talk to him when i'm sad/suicidal and so on . Whenever i'm in school, downtown ... whenerver i'm not at home HE is still there and before this corona shit i slept smiling randomly when i had a conversation with him (in my head of course) and those looks (omfg the looks) other people gave me were something else. I havent even told this my close online friends nor my psychiartists because i'm so scared that they will laugh at me. 

I cant even blame anyone for laughing at me because wtf i'm 16 and while others go to the mall with their friend group i either get panic attacks or ho there with a person that only exists in my head.

Cat died.,"Psychologist told me I scored high on major depression, that’s cool. Threw a lot of info at me and I just wanted to talk. It was weird. But my cat died three days ago. Grew up with her, loved her and she loved me. Was like my daughter. We had a bond I can’t explain, I knew what she was thinking and feeling and she knew me. I was already severely depressed before, for 10 or so years I’ve been struggling with anxiety and depression, my suicidal ideation has been bad these past few months, my boyfriend broke up with me and then got back together a few weeks ago which threw my insecurities and anxiety into overdrive. His sister is giving a lot of bullshit that I just don’t want to deal with but feel like I have to, and my cat fucking died. She was fine, she was sleeping on my clothes I had left on a table in my room, she was snoring, then she started choking. I thought she was going to throw up, I put her out of my room because I have a weird thing with animals throwing up, I forgot to mention it to my dad who takes care of it. A few minutes later they come in and tell me she’s actually choking. I insist on going with to the vets but my mum refuses. They come back and hour later and tell me she had a heart attack. That she’s dead. I cried and got angry, I said goodbye. And now I feel empty. Like I’m dreaming for the past few days, I’m not really here. It’s confusing. I’m not mourning how I usually do, instead I’m in shock and denial, and then crying, then denial, shock, dreaming. I hate it. I don’t know why I’m posting this, I don’t know what I want from this, if anything. I can’t be angry, can’t blame anyone. I don’t know what to do when she was my cuddle bug, she was there for me when my dog died. When I had my migraines or I was sick, she cried for me when I left for too long. She was there for me. But she’s gone, and my other animals hate cuddles. I just want to hug her, or hug a cat that won’t freak out for no reason.

Currently (possibly) failing college,"Hi there and good day to everyone reading this.

Essentially the title.

Just a bit of background so you can get some context on the situation. I am currently a sophomore taking a Computer Science major (which I feel would help me the best in accomplishing my dream to become an indie game developer). 

I started college 2 years ago (2018) after my parents had forced me to go to college directly after Highschool even though I wanted to take a year break before I did, just to prepare my mind and just to do stuff that I was/am interested in (Website design, game dev, piano playing and drawing). 

To make matters worse they actually picked a major for me to do (Electrical engineering) which I did not enjoy at all (the damn course had physics, one of my most disliked subjects ever). I did fail my first year as a result and then switched to a computer science Major (to be done in the 2019 academic year). This went MUCH better than the first year and then finally managed to make it into my sophomore year. ""The future is looking bright right?"" I thought to myself. 

Fast forward to this year and things start to turn south once again. With the pandemic going on it really made life a bit difficult. Normally I'm used to studying in a disciplined environment, but at home it was basically impossible, due to chores that needed to be done, renovation plans and dogs constantly barking in our neighborhood. Also for some reason, I just lost motivation to study when I thought about people who are dying and losing their lives, jobs and only way to survive . I failed a course last semester (statistics) and failed another stats course (got 49 which was agonizingly close, just 1% more to  pass) this semester. Also provided that I don't get at least 50 for an upcoming Computer Science (A CS course from this semester as well) retest, I basically fail my major and will more than likely have to repeat.

My college however, in these difficult times, has announced that there will be no academic exclusions (nobody will be kicked out even if they fail).

I'm just a bit saddened that it's come to this. My parents are probably going to kill me if they find out and I really don't know what to do. They are the type to berate and compare you to other great top achievers and other guys who are smart etc.

I really love the idea of creating video games (starting to learn unity now), playing video games as well (as a matter of fact got some money saved up to build one before black Friday ends this year) and creating websites (I'm making one right now for myself), and sometimes I wonder that if I can't pass Computer Science is that dream/thought just a joke?

Am I depressed?,"Ok so i'ma just try to keep this short. I'm extremely insecure about my looks and I always judge myself harsh on something. I would always think of myself as an idiot and someone who would never matter. I don't know how it feels to be close to someone and really connect with them. I don't have a good relationship with my sister(I dislike her) and sometimes when I talk to my parents I talk to them like i'm half dead. I'm not saying I don't love them but I just feel like I have nobody in my life that I can just talk to about anything. I did have thoughts about cutting my wrist every now and then but I didn't want it to leave any scars. I had heard it makes the ""pain"" go away for a good 5-10 minutes then it's back to reality. I'm pretty stressed out with school right now especially since I will be applying to college soon but I guess this isn't important. I don't have anything to motivate me moving forward because I feel like my future life will most likely just end up being meaningless. I'm 16 at the moment almost 17 but I have made a deal with myself by the time I reach 25 and if I wasn't at least somewhat pleased with my life by then I would just kill himself. I'm the type of person that just keeps everything to myself because what good would come out of it saying it to someone and it wouldn't change anything. I'm asking this question because I feel like i'm just being stupid and there are people out there will real actual problems. So please just tell me Am I depressed because I feel like this isn't a valid reason. If you're wondering I do have friends that I talk to and my relationship with them and my parents are fine.

"Having wonderful, loving, supportive family doesn’t make you any less depressed.","I have two extremely loving parents, a supportive sister, and a handful of close friends who I know would always listen if I needed it. I am still extremely depressed and ready to end it all. I attempted suicide 4 years ago, ended up in the psych ward for 2 weeks, and my family and friends visited every day. 

I can barely function anymore. I try so incredibly hard every day to be normal, to work, walk, chat, and appear fine. Mentally, I am thinking about killing myself for hours every day. Today I lost it, blew off work, and slept the entire day. I cried to my mother and she cried with me. Asked me what I needed, willing to do anything, but it doesn’t help. 

There isn’t anything wrong with me. I’m young, pretty, thin, and am capable of making friends and keeping them. I have a STEM degree, I’ve had committed relationships. None of that makes me happy. The true tragedy of my life is that I know I could do more, be more, and I just cant. 

I’ve been told I am strong because I haven’t done drugs or drank, because I powered through my degree, because I haven’t killed myself. I’m not strong, I’m guilted. Having a family who loves you and you love is a double edged sword. 

Love doesn’t cure depression. It does wrack you with guilt if you even think of attempting it. It would destroy my family. I’m not exaggerating. They have all told me individually, may times, that it would. My parents would never forgive themselves. I would haunt them forever.

I tried therapy. After I got out of the hospital I was on anti-depressants. I tried different meds, I saw 4 different therapists. It all just made it so much worse. One of my therapists almost got me involuntarily recommitted to the hospital. Her talking to my parents and ensuring they would be picking me up and taking me home was the only thing that saved me. 

Even the “good” therapists just made me feel worse. I would leave every appointment more depressed than I came in. I quit trying that after a year. The thing about therapy is that you are forced to lie. I was suicidal but couldn’t talk about it. If they suspect anything you get the cops called on you and they forces you into the prison that is the psych ward. They force medication on you, get you fired from your job, and destroy whatever remnants of a life you had. 

My mother is a certified grief councillor. She volunteers in hospice and regularly supports grieving people. She can’t help me. Talking to her is pointless. She will cry and beg me not to. It doesn’t make me feel better, just guilty.

All this rambling because the truth is that I am without hope. My family is dragging me through life. All the love in the world and it doesn’t make a fucking difference. Drugs, therapy, doesn’t matter. Depression is a death sentence and there is no cure. 

My only hope is to distance myself from them and one day just do it. Push them far enough away that they grieve me and move on. That way, killing myself won’t affect anyone.

Guilt.,"I came out to my parents. And Ive been holding onto it for a long time, a lot of negative emotions. I've been depressed for a few years. And I mustered up the courage to tell them about the woman I love and just like I expected it to, it came crashing down. 
They're religious. They can't change their values for me and that's okay, but trying to change me is something else. Saying ""it's a phase"" screaming in my face that I've changed, but they've never known me that well. It's repetitive. 
I hate myself. I always have because I knew I was different. Because I'm quiet, because I'm weird, because i like girls, because I've grown up knowing liking girls was wrong. 
There's guilt. I'm ashamed of the way I bark back when I'm angry. I'm sad.
But I love them. And I'm angry. So angry, and so disappointed, and so frustrated, to the point my head feels like it's on fire. So sad my heart feels like being pressed onto broken glass.
I don't wanna hurt anyone, I dont want to upset them.
But I just find myself drifting more and more apart from my family. And I hate it. Because I love them so much.  
And this guilt carries onto my rs, maybe I'm leading her to a bad path. Sending her to hell with me, is it right for me to love her? 
Sometimes the guilt makes me want to leave her. Disappear for good, and hope she won't miss me the way I would miss her dearly.

How to know if I should quit medication,"My “depression” comes from my thoughts. I go into a loop of negative thoughts which make me feel hopeless about everything in life. 

My psychiatrist never actually gave me a diagnosis. I don’t actually know if I have depression/anxiety etc. 

I’ve been on antidepressants as well as therapy for a few months...but I still have depression. I still ruminate about everything negative. I only see the negative. 

I don’t like medicine because it annoys me that I need to waste $300 every month for a follow up. I feel so guilty and it makes me feel worse. That’s the only reason I want to stop taking medication. 

I had an appointment 2 days ago and he kept my medication at the same dose - Zoloft 50mg. I really don’t feel a difference with medicine. I have 0 side affects. I was feeling so much better but it came crashing down because my dad put me down on Friday. It’s Sunday now. A normal person would not have gotten upset, but a simple hurtful statement made me question my ability at life and makes me realize I’m a failure.

This year has been so hard I need someones words,"I was a really happy guy until this year, one awful thing keeps happening right after another

The first thing that really messed me up, was my ex who was with me for 3 years, left me for someone else she met. This MESSED me up because I loved her more than anything else in the world. To say I was depressed and insane would be an understatement. It doesn't help that I checked her social media (i know you should never do that) but I saw she is still with that guy, they have a house together and shes pregnant. 

Since she broke up with me, I couldn't afford to live on my own so i had to move back in with my mom. A month after i moved back in with my mom, she found out she has cancer all over her body. Shes been on chemo this whole time, but the cancer is still slowly spreading and the thought of losing her rips me apart. She probably doesn't have too much time left. This has been hard on everyone in my family. 

Yet another problem. I have been applying to jobs for months so I can get my own apartment and try to restart my life. I can't get a job to hire me that will pay enough to get me a 1 bedroom apartment no matter how hard I try. I'm so desperate for a decent job.

To add onto all of that. I dont have 1 single friend. The only people that ive gotten text from since March is family. 

Everything is falling apart and i can't fix any of it. I cant dig myself out of this hole no matter how hard i try. Ive been giving it my all for months. I really really want to give up and end myself. NOTHING is working out for me. I thought that the idea of suicide would go away by now, but it's staying. I hate my life. I'm so miserable, lonely, and hopeless. Everything is falling apart and i can't seem to fix any of it.

I've been on antidepressants for a long time which just barely make me a functional human being but have also completely killed my libido. NSFW,"I've stopped trying for ANY sexual activity a long time ago. It was frustrating at first but then I just gave into it. It's kinda like why would I even try to drink water when I have ZERO thirst or need to. It's to the extent that sexuality basically doesn't exist anymore for me. 

Last week I ran out of medication and wasn't able to pick up my refills for a few days which I thought was no big deal. Nothing's gonna happen. 

A beautiful but sad and painful feeling of love and missing my friends, family and other important persons came rushing back to me on day two. People who I knew, was close to back in my old life when I was ok. I definitely knew that right now I have nothing and no one and the pills make me function okay with that idea but feeling it with my whole mind was way more worse but beautiful at the same time. 

That night I dreamed the whole night. All these different times, places and people from my past were in it just randomly sprinkled throughout the night.

Though I don't remember any sexual part of my dreams, I also woke up in the morning to find out I had a wet dream during the night. My first orgasm or ejaculation in 3 years. On night 2 of no pills. 


There's no good option. I go back on the pills and become an emotionally stunted robot without creativity but I will be functional. Or I drop the pills and feel everything, the beautiful but also reminded of everything painful every day.

I am officially sick of this shit,"Growing up I was always told how much ""better"" things get as you get older. When I was in middle school it was ""Wait until high school, things get so much better!"" then it was ""Wait until college, your life will really turn around!!"" and now that I'm finally fucking here all I get is ""Wait until after college, you get a lot more freedom then!!!!!!!111"" When the fuck does it actually get better? I've spent all of this time trying to improve myself and anticipating the future only to end up in a worse spot than I was two years ago. I'm living in a shittier neighborhood, attending a shitty community college while I'm not even sure what my major is, while I've lost contact with everyone I knew from high school almost immediately after I graduated.

And this pandemic shit doesn't help either. Now instead of attending a shitty community college, I'm attending a shitty virtual community college! Not that it really matters anyways, since it's still the dreaded social desert known as community college. What a waste of time.

What exactly am I supposed to be doing, anyways? I have no money, no connections, the economy is in the toilet and I cant find a job, and even if I did I would still need to drive 30 minutes to it with the license I don't have since my mom had no choice but to move out here in bumfuck nowhere hickville where anything worth a damn requires a half a tank of gas.

Revenge,"Something must have happened a long time ago that completely shattered my mind setting me on this path, maybe I could recover from that but why should I do that? I don want to live as a crippled version of myself, I know I could have been a lot better than this with a happy and fulfilling life, with friends and a girlfriend, achieving my dreams. I had it all on the paper. But something happened, a seed of sorrow has been planted in me that begun to grow as I was growing. I can’t be the better version of myself anymore and that’s unfair. All I can do now is to wish people suffering, I can’t even make someone suffer myself because I don’t matter to anyone enough, so I wish every happy people to loose everything. I wish that everyone has so suffer like me, feeling alone and helpless to the point of loosing their mind. I hate happy people so much, they have stolen from us directly or indirectly. Their happiness is based on the harm they did to other in order to gain a position of advantage in life. Its time that we consume our revenge and since we can’t reclaim what has been stolen from us we can only make happy people’s life worse. 
The next time do the right thing and harm who make you suffer, but don’t stop there, make every happy person pay by any means.
Remember that their happiness and fulfilment is stolen, they took down someone else in order to have less competition and gain that advantage.

How Virtual Teaching Unleashed My Depression,"So I’ve always considered myself a happy go lucky guy but that idea of myself has come crashing down in the last few months. I have a wonderful family, secure career, golden retriever, house and all that stuff but as of recent something feels broken inside of me. 

I have been virtually teaching since March. At first I was ok with it. Covid was rampant in my area and staying home seemed best. But now 9 months later talking to a blank computer screen has done something to me. My students aren’t required to have their cameras on, as per our district, so they don’t turn them on. I spin my wheels every day teaching and trying to get some for of class discussion going and I get nothing. By 3pm, Monday to Friday, I just feel like my efforts were pointless.

This is has slowly been spilling into my personal life. I am having a hard time finding joy in the things I used to do. I love the outdoors and taking my kids hiking, now I can’t even get the motivation to get going. I would take my dog for this hour long walks, now I just take him in the yard. I have opened up to my wife about my feelings and it’s a mixed response. Some days she’s very supportive, others it seems she thinks nothing is wrong. That can be my own perspective though. We have been arguing more and I feel that is just adding to my problem, or I have a growing feeling that I am her problem now.

I’ve cut out drinking, I was a casual beer drinker on weekends. I’ve been waking up early to work out hoping that can give me a boost. But overall I just feel like i don’t know who am I anymore. I’ve lost my life/work balance. I have no time to decompress from work to enjoy my family and free time. I did reach out for help but it seemed only momentary as the waves of feelings come back a day or two later.

I really don’t know what to do. I don’t know the words to use when I’m talking to my wife. I just feel a piece of me slipping away day by day.

Therapist’s therapist,"Hi, I’m 15 and I’ve suffered from depression since I was 10. When I was 12 I lost my mom to cancer after seeing her getting sicker and sicker, not recognise me anymore, losing hair, all the hospital visits and all her crying. I’ve never loved anyone like her and I don’t think I ever will. My little sister always had a stronger bond with my dad and I had it with her so now I just feel so lost. My father makes me feel so shitty because I’m still depressed and it’s really hard even to get out of bed so to do basic chores is like giving birth to a fucking baby. I switched to a lot of therapists and the one I’m seeing now doesn’t even seem one...? I talked her about how I don’t wanna live anymore and she just replied “no don’t say that”. Every time I get out of her office I feel even more like shit and like I need to talk to yet another person of what she says to me AND all my other problems. Plus since my father is the one paying her of course he calls her before our appointments and tells her what to tell me since he knows I stopped caring about what he says. They both makes me feel “crazy” like I’m living in this other dimension that apparently is so different from the one everybody else is experiencing? I don’t even know if it makes sense. I just know that I’m really tired, tired of feeling like this for years while seeing all my peers making new relationships, going out and all those good things that I wanna experience too, but I can’t even get out of bed. I feel so close to the end and I just keep screaming help and since no one is responding I’m taking it as a sign that maybe right now is the time.

Am I going to spend the whole time hating myself?

Having periods of time where I make friends and connections then just push them all away and isolate myself from everyone because I don't think I'm good enough for any of them?

Am I going to keep not giving my best because my best isn't worth anything?

Am I just going to believe I'm not good enough for a job or friends or my own home or for a relationship or marriage or having a family later?

Am I just going to keep having to use meds to stop my brain going into a total meltdown for everyday life?

Am I going to keep making myself small and invisible in all conversations to not humiliate myself or make other people uncomfortable?

Am I going to constantly spend all my energy just hating every aspect of my body, my mind, myself. Am I going to keep rejecting any kindness or gratitude giving onto me?

I'm finding it more and more difficult to not end my life,"I have been finding the urge to kill myself growing like a vine under my skin. It's not even like I have a real reason to feel this way. All of my trauma has run its course and I'm living a fairly decent life, for what it is. I should be happy, I should be proud of how far I've gotten given some of the things I've gone through. Yet, nothing really feels real anymore. It feels like I'm stuck in some kind of blurry dream where time keeps passing but nothing is happening. 

For someone so hopeless, I'm so optimistic. I can find endless reasons for people to live, yet when I'm trying to convince myself to not crash my car on the highway on my way to work, it feels like I'm grasping for straws. How can I see the value in life yet still want to die??? I don't understand, it's driving me mad. And I'm trying so hard, every day, to just push through. People kept telling me it would get better. And yes, life has gotten better. But it doesn't make me want to die less. 

I feel achingly lonely all of the time. I put my *everything* into the people I care about. I always show up, I always answer calls, I remind people I love them, I always give advice when they ask, I spoil people with affection, and I try my best to be a good person. But I feel very left behind all of the time. I only have 2 friends that regularly talk to me, and only one friend that checks up on me. My family is doing their best, but they're all so busy and only make effort whenever I reach out to them. And this guy I'm talking to, I like him so much. We connected so fast and he kept saying he felt the same and now he's distant and I just feel like I'm getting in his way now. 

I feel like such a burden. I hold everything in because I want to be there for other people &amp; not put my issues on anyone, but then I spiral and people tell me to open up, but then I open up and no one has anything to say, and then I go back to never hearing from anyone until they need something. I don't think everyone hates me or anything, I know people care about me. But I feel very much like I'm just *there* in everyone's lives and if I disappeared then they wouldn't really be missing much. I think people would get over my death very quickly. 

I could go on forever, but I think you get the point. I'm just tired from always feeling like TV static. I probably won't kill myself, but it's been weighing heavy on my mind.

I don't have any life goals,"No real goals or ambitions, no hopes or dreams, nothing. I'm starting to not even give a shit if I die tomorrow, in fact, I think I'd be better off. The closet thing to a ""life goal"" that I have right now is that I want to find new forms of escapism and ways to temporarily keep my mind distracted from reality (for as long as possible), that's it.

I never really did have goals, I spent my entire life just feeling lost and confused about the future. I use to pretend to have goals and passions, in order to keep my family off my back, but even that's getting more and more difficult. Especially, since I'm pretty much an adult (21) and my parents have been getting  pushier about me ""finding a career path, picking a university and going back to school"" and saying that ""simply having a job isn't good enough."" (I have a job and pay rent, so it's not like I'm free loading off of them) My mom is trying to push me to get a master's degree, when I didn't even complete my associate's because I had no idea what the fuck I wanted to ""do with my life."" I left college last year because without a goal in mind, it felt pointless.

And it's not that I don't understand how they feel. I'm their only child and they want me to have a better life, I get that. But I just can't bring myself to care about those things anymore.  When I think about the future, I feel a weird mixture of hopelessness and apathy. It's hard to explain but it's like, I know I'm fucked no matter what I do with my life, so why should I even care?

Dreamt about my ex last night,"Had a dream that we were apartment hunting in a city that we've never lived in together. We broke up in 2017 and I haven't had any steady relationships since then. 

What's funny is that in the dream I was perceiving some of the same problems that we had in our real relationship: jealousy, frustration...

Why did she return to me last night? Am I not over her?
She's had a relationship going for some time now and I don't want to try and re-kindle. 

I've been so depressed for over a year now, that I have no inclination to date or see anyone. I know I'm not ready and will disappoint and hurt anyone who gets near me.

I'm not gonna make it through the winter.,"Bit of backstory first: I lost basically all my relationships including a really good romantic one this year. I can't go to college due to the pandemic. I hate my job, and I do nothing with my time at home. 

Anyways, now I'm just going to flat out state it. I'll probably be dead by the time 2021 rolls around. Every day gets worse for me. Antidepressants just turn me into a raging monster and don't actually fix the problem, and every medication I've tried has failed. I think I'm just cursed. Cursed with a shitty fucking life that means nothing. I hope I can find a quick, clean way to end my life by the end of the year because I just can't take it anymore. Not that any of you should care. I'm an Internet stranger.

I just figured I would tell *someone* because I know my family can't help. Therapist can't really help either. She just keeps telling me that there's gonna be a vaccine soon as if all my problems stem from the pandemic alone.

I’m lonely cuz bf is depressed,"I’m depressed and anxious all the time, but it’s usually not debilitating (before covid at least). I recently met the sweetest, most wonderful guy and we’ve been dating for a month and a half. We talked almost every single day since we met, but now he’s in the middle of what I imagine for him is a bad depressive episode (I would be in the hospital if at that point). He hasn’t been communicating with me nearly at all. Instead of talking to me, he posts on fb about being disappointed or changed his profile picture for the first time since we met.

I know that I cannot “fix” him and I do not want to try. I can offer him support, but he needs professional help that I cannot provide. What I am asking for advice on is that I do not know what to do with myself. Usually when I have a romantic partner or even close friend, we talk all the time and maybe even hang out and do something. When I’m alone, I am completely alone save for my family and I can cope with that fine. I don’t know how to be in between. I don’t know how to cope with having a boyfriend, who I love and loves me back, who won’t talk to me. I see that he’s online and available to talk, but he just doesn’t want to, and that makes me sad and anxious. I am lonely and I feel guilty for feeling lonely, because I know what he’s going through.

I would try and make other friends, but I feel bad having friends I only reach out to when I’m lonely and sad like I’m taking advantage of their kindness. I’m terrible at keeping friends, and I’m just so lost right now. If anyone could give me any advice on coping and feeling less stressed all. the. time.

I can't seem to find motivation to do anything,"22m two-time college dropout stuck upstairs in my parents' house here. I honestly don't know why I'm talking about myself anywhere. I shouldn't need to be here but like idk why i do anything anymore so whatever. My gf tells me to wake her up if I get like this again, but honestly I hate to bother her for any of this shit just bc she has enough to worry about. I guess I'm just realizing how overwhelmed I am. I tend to bury it pretty deep so I can help my gf, parents and sister with their shit, but this feeling just keeps coming up at the oddest of times. Pretty sure my parents are gonna divorce one of these days, and my sister wont interact with any of us if she's high which is literally all the time. My gf freaks out over me a lot bc she never knows when I'm gonna fall apart, and the anticipation kills her inside. I just got my life together why does it feel like literally everything around me is falling apart?

It's been over a year since I officially cut ties with my suicidal bipolar ex, and the feelings I got back then should be gone, but they aren't. I still have dreams of her. Memories of her screaming at me to give up on her still haunt me. The crippling futility I felt back then never left. I don't think it ever will.

I don't know what I'm typing anymore. Every time I try to better my life I freeze up and give up on everything. I want to be so much more than I am. I can't get back on Vyvanse bc the 10 years I was taking it as a kid have already fucked me up enough. I always end up doing the exact opposite of what I want to do. I just want to do shit with my life instead of wasting all of my time eating like shit and hiding all my feelings from the people who are trying to bring me up so I can do literally nothing.

Aaaand I'm relapsing again 💙,"I have an ED and depression and for the most part I've done well to hide my ED from family and other people. Rn I just feel so low in my life and it feels like everything is starting to go to shit. School has gotten to a stage where I'm finding it so difficult I'm not even sure I want to do this anymore. I have friends I talk to daily however I was always the only one who was actively trying in friendship. It made me feel invisible and sad so I just stopped extending effort and since then none of them have talked to me and probably not going to. I guess I'm not not that interesting of a person or someone that other people want to keep in their lives. I know no ones going to worry about me or think about me, they'll just forget and move on with themselves. I feel like it's all my fault and like I pushed everyone away even though I knew that if I stopped being the one to initiate convos and stuff the entire friendship would die out. So they did. And now I'm alone in my little corner again. A 12 year friendship ended because I stopped bending backwards for them just to get them to talk to me. Waking up every single day has become physically painful from the anxiety and EDs and I just feel really disposable and invisible. I've done well hiding my issues from other people and still do but whenever I'm back to being alone again with my own thoughts is when shit hits. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm tired of being replaced by everyone. I'm tired of feeling like I'm on my last straw every single day. I'm tired of feeling like the world's moving way too fast for me to catch up with everything. I don't know where I'm going or what I'm doing and now on top of that I'm mostly alone too except from couple of interactions where people decide I can be used as a free therapist or they can get something from me. I'm just.... there. Nothing worthwhile though. I feel like an outsider at all times. I can't admit to my family because that means il have to expose my own eating disorders and mental health problems to them. I love a lot and our family dynamic is excellent but mental health isn't something I can talk about to them and I feel like I'm ruining an otherwise happy and perfect family.

I'm lost. But my family is suffering!,"I know when all of these started, I was 15, I got the chance to go to my dream Uni in the country, but my family just suffered from a recent death, and my Mom did let my study in the Uni that I wanted to go. I blamed my Mom and myself for not speaking up early and maybe I still had the chance to catch up. But I did. I lost all motivation to study. 

I FELT LOST THEN. I FELT EVERYONE ARE BETTER THAN ME. I FELT LIKE I'M THE WORTHLESS GUY. 

I kept telling my parents that I wasn't happy with the course I was taking. But my parents told me to just study as it would be just a waste of time and money to shift courses but the never listened. 

Somehow I finished the course. I wasn't happy on my graduation day. I FELT I COULD'VE DONE BETTER. My Mom and Dad were happy. But I wasn't. I got the degree, but I didn't learn anything. 

My parents wanted me to go straight to Med school. But I held myself and said that I want to take gap year (wait a year or two). 

I took up night work instead of a day job, so that I can been far from the stress of daily life. 

Two years have passed, and in those 2 years I worked hard and didn't spent a penny on myself and opened a small business just to help myself and the family with the tuition. And just in case something happens to me. I know I had my family sorted out. But I am still not well. I want to end everything. I want it to stop. I cry at night. I'm lost. I don't know what is happening. 

Now I am in Med school. To follow the Dream that I want to be a doctor. But I have no motivation. I don't study at all. I can't focus. I feel like everytime I have to study, I will fail. I have no self confidence. I feel like I'm a failure. I just lay on the bed with no feeling but the thought of ending it. I need help but I'm afraid my parents won't understand where I'm coming from AGAIN.

Is this normal?,"Hey guys,

Bit worried / unsure about this and wanted to reach out and ask if this was symptomatic of depression.

Recently, I’ve started questioning and wondering what the point of any of this is (life).

I don’t have any unwanted or obtrusive thoughts. It’s more of a dull feeling.

As a kid, I wanted to do something ‘important’ or ‘amazing’ with my life. Picked up a guitar at 15 and set my eyes on becoming a musician. Also, had dreams of becoming an actor when I was younger. Got a BA in Drama, but out of uni neither was I well-equipped or in the know at all about the industry and soon lost faith in that. (Something universities and educational institutes better damn start looking into).

Grew up, got a regular job. And now life just feels as though it’s on mute, living paycheck to paycheck, and I’ve given up on my dreams. Music and film are my biggest passions and I enjoy playing guitar and singing. I also pick apart films and TV with regard to cinematography, acting, plot and the rest of it. Not just a casual viewer.

But I think now that a career in the arts is massively self-indulgent and I almost tell myself that it’s also stupid and a pipe dream now. The market itself is saturated and sometimes when I listen to music now I do just end up thinking ‘well I’ve heard this before, why are you any different? What makes you so special that I should listen to your take on heartbreak?’ 

My partner of 2 years and I recently broke up too. I have no interest in dating and, yeah, life just feels a bit meh.

Is it a matter of goal-setting to get myself out of this slump, am I being too cynical about the arts, etc.?",SnooPets1514,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jyw0hd/is_this_normal/,hey guy bit worried unsure wanted reach ask wa symptomatic depression recently started questioning wondering point life unwanted obtrusive thought dull feeling kid wanted something important amazing life picked guitar 15 set eye becoming musician also dream becoming actor wa younger got ba drama uni neither wa well equipped know industry soon lost faith something university educational institute better damn start looking grew got regular job life feel though mute living paycheck paycheck given dream music film biggest passion enjoy playing guitar singing also pick apart film tv regard cinematography acting plot rest casual viewer think career art massively self indulgent almost tell also stupid pipe dream market saturated sometimes listen music end thinking well heard different make special listen take heartbreak partner 2 year recently broke interest dating yeah life feel bit meh matter goal setting get slump cynical art etc,normal,snoop ets 1514,1636,15,snoop ets 1514 hey guy bit worried unsure wanted reach ask wa symptomatic depression recently started questioning wondering point life unwanted obtrusive thought dull feeling kid wanted something important amazing life picked guitar 15 set eye becoming musician also dream becoming actor wa younger got ba drama uni neither wa well equipped know industry soon lost faith something university educational institute better damn start looking grew got regular job life feel though mute living paycheck paycheck given dream music film biggest passion enjoy playing guitar singing also pick apart film tv regard cinematography acting plot rest casual viewer think career art massively self indulgent almost tell also stupid pipe dream market saturated sometimes listen music end thinking well heard different make special listen take heartbreak partner 2 year recently broke interest dating yeah life feel bit meh matter goal setting get slump cynical art etc normal

9 PM Thoughts (spoiler: life fcking sucks),"Everyone around me is doing their best to provide for themselves and for me. They have it all (or the majority) figured out. But here I am, a fucking drop out, stuck figuring out what I want to do in life.

I'm not even sure if I need to figure out what I want. Maybe it's a selfish act. I should've just finished my college degree, get a diploma and work. Maybe I was just too entitled to think that what I want actually matters.

So living to work and earn money like cog machines, is this what life really is? Maybe my life doesn't differ from anybody else. I used to think I have potential, maybe it was bullshit after all.

I feel like I'm drowning in a deep well of guilt. My mind is in an abyss of guilt because my mom is doing her best to take care of my family and especially me even though she's struggling physically and mentally to keep up as well.

It feels like I'm in a tug of war between wanting to end my life but stopping out of guilt I'll cause to my family. They don't deserve a dead daughter but they also don't deserve a shitty depressed daughter who can't even get up from her bed.

The hospital wants to throw me to the wolves,"So I have been on short term disability and leave of absence from my job since October 12th due to a psychotic break.  A complete mental breakdown.

I have suffered from depression,  anxiety and drug use since I was a teen.  I'm in my early 50's now.  But this was the first real time I've actually committed to treatment..  I wasn't able to get into the program for 2 weeks after my leave began due to there not being an opening.  When I finally did start it was of course all virtual.  The book I received was a bunch of copied pages in a generic white binder.  Not even page numbers.  I got a lot of ""Cheer up.  Look a things from a different perspective.  Say ""I get to do this"" instead of ""I have to do this"".  And i also got a lot of medication thrown at me.  But no solid, real help.  Also came to the realization that my drinking and drug use had a lot to do with causing my mental health issues, not the other way around.  But I came to that realization on my own, not through anything they helped me with.

When I suggested that I may need drug and alcohol treatment as well it was like they closed me off.  They agreed I needed the treatment but that I did not need to extend my LOA.

Now my job is one of the main reasons I had my break to begin with.  And I am nowhere near ready to go back.  Everytime I even think about it my emotions go haywire, I can't eat, can't sleep.  Hate the thought.  I used to love my job (customer service for a large insurance company internationally known) but over time this particular job can literally grind you down.  With the right treatment and help I may get that joy back.  But the hospital refuses to sign off on it.  They say I  need structure.  But how is throwing me back Into a situation that helped cause my break to begin with help me, especially when I know I am not mentally or emotionally ready?  I feel like no one there is even listening to me.  I am getting a second opinion from another place, but I am worried that the other hospital will tell them that I don't need the extension and they will force me to go back.  

  Now obviously my job is not the only issue, but at this point it was a major factor in my recent issues.  My immediate supervisor understands and agrees with me, as do my co workers and friends, but the original hospital doesn't care and won't listen.  Now I am feeling like I am being forced to go back and I will quit first.  But if I quit I will lose my insurance and won't be able to get treatment at all.  I feel backed into corner with the hospital saying I should just deal with it but my mind telling me if I go back it will not end well.  Like with suicide.  Or worse.  My anger is out of control, with me snapping at the least slight.  This will not end well at all.

"It's so sad that other people who want to live die, but I get to live","So far, I almost died 4 times

1 : when I was born, I was born premature and dead, but doctors revived me.... Yay...

2: I had an epilepsy attack when I was around 4 years old, almost died, but again, doctors kept me alive... Yay.....

3) when I was 15, I swallowed a bunch of pills, but I grabbed the wrong bottle so I only ended up getting a bit of a stomach ache for a few days

4) about a month ago, I bought a shotgun, I was ready to kill myself, loaded it, I aimed the gun at my head, ready to pull the trigger, but I couldn't do it, so I just went home to continue living my pathetic life.


So many people who have dreams and aspirations, who has accomplished so much, or planning on doing so, or simply enjoy living their life, they die, but me, who is literally begging God for death, nothing.

Chemical,"It all started with a chemical imbalance diagnosis. Come to realize my life and childhood has took the joy out of life. Abusive mother and a father that had no power to save me. Even now as an adult he can only offer help but never provides it when needed. Attempts and cries for help never solved anything. Over a year total spent in hospitals. Tons of medications, sometimes up to seven at a time. Finally freed from the prison that is my mother only into the arms of a boyfriend who has continued the cycle. One in which I deserve. Came to terms that some people (me) are just born into a world meant for failure. I've tried to find happiness. In fact I was very happy for awhile. I've been off medication for months and was finally able to be genuinely happy. Unfortunately life has its ways and I've been set back in my place.

I seem to have an OK life and I feel terrible that I am not happy,"I have a great paying job, I have some debts that I will pay off eventually. I have a great relationship, I have a dog I love so much. I didnt have the best childhood but I am OK now, with a great relationship with my mom. But why am I so sad, frustrated, angry? 

When I'm alone, I think about the best way to die but I can't leave my mom, and my dog. I used to have a bad habit of nail biting and I always thought it was just a simple habit but recently it's back and I realised that I bite my nails till they hurt and they bleed because I need the pain. I don't stop until they hurt. 

My life doesn't warrant such sadness, such anger and such feelings. I should be happy, I should be satisfied with life. But I can't pinpoint what is going to make me happy at all. Nothing I change in my life will make me happy because I will always find something to be upset or sad about.

I feel like I’m in a good relationship but I don’t know I’m worried I feel as if I’m not good enough and he might leave me and not want me again and he tells me He feels like I’m self projecting and I know I’m not cuz he is the only human being that gives me enough attention and love and I don’t talk to other as I’m not social because it’s hard to talk to anyone else other then him and he’s get paranoid about this I keep trying to reassure him and I try not to tell him when I feel like this because he says I’m just self projecting and then he tells me I don’t tell him everything and it’s just a cycle. (Tw) I also do self-h sometime and I’m trying to stop but it’s like a addiction so I tell him but I’m starting to feel like I’m trapping him in this relationship so I don’t tell him when I do that stuff anymore and do Shane he does find out about that he scolds me for not saying anything. He’s asked to take a break a and so I’m trying not to talk to him but this feeling of loneliness I haven’t felt in a while and thought full my head the only voice I hear is the one telling me ways to get rid of myself I don’t wanna bother him or anyone anymore....I’m probably not saying this the best as this is from my perspective and I’m not that good at writing and explaining things (sorry for bad grammar/spelling)

I can't do this anymore,"This is going to be a little be long to read but I want to thank anyone who's gonna dedicate a few mins to read it.

I've (F18) been depressed for a long time now. Had a shitty childhood and went through bullying since ages 12-17. I never had many friends because people didn't liked me but I was cool with that because I had my 3 best friends. All changed tho, 3 months ago they all left me. 1 of them for no reason she just stop replying to my texts (the other two didnt want to hang around me anymore )and it hurts because I shared my feelings with these people,they shared theirs too and they just left . Now I'm here sitting on my bed all day crying because I feel so lonely. Seeing all these people talking about how awesome their friends are and seeing them going out makes me even more depressed.I wish I had friends and I wish someone would want to be my friend :( I don't have anyone to talk and I feel such a loser because the only person I can talk to without feeling that I'm bothering them is myself. Yes I talk to myself. Its embarrassing. I also have a real low self esteem. I always believed that I was fat/ugly/annoying and I still believe ,that this is the reason noone wants to be my friend. I can't keep living that. I'm so tired of feeling useless,ugly,pathetic. All the kids I know (from my school,neighbourhood etc) are all going in college. And then there's me that can't even find a job to pay to go to the college I want. I'm a failure. I'm sick of feeling like that all these years. I want to k*ll myself but the only reason I haven't done this yet is because I dont have the guts to tell my bf (he's the best person on earth and the reason why I started changing and becoming a better person + he's the reason I stop taking drugs) that I don't wanna live  anymore. I can't let him down but I also cant live with myself. I hate me. I hate me so much. I secretly wish someone would k*ll me with their car.

Doctor reduces my dose and won't give me barely anything for withdrawals,"I'm currently in hospital for suicidal thoughts and am usually on 300mg of effexor daily and mirtazapine that I take at night to sleep. They reduced my dose to 150 of Effexor 2 days ago without telling me and then after complaints of withdrawals from me they stated they reduced my dose so that they could give me thiamine (Vitamin B1). Which makes no fucking sense.

Now my mirtazapine isn't working for sleep for the withdrawals and its almost 12am and I'm not tired whatsoever. I asked if I could have something else to help me sleep and they said no because I had Valium like 3 hours ago.

They're giving me the tiniest amount of Valium throughout the day for withdrawals which isn't doing anything and then saying they can't do anything else to help.

"why i leaved my home , life was easy","Alienation is not an alternative to homeland, but rather exile. Here you will live alone, no friends, no one, just distant contacts full of nostalgia. No one pays to pick you up in the evening in a café, bar or zoo. You are also an animal in a cage, your bank account coughs because you are doing illegal work. You can hang your neck on a rope, who cares? ... No one cares. Love comes stumbling down like an ambush dialogue with dead words, if you don't live miserable... no one is waiting for you to arrive at night. Success comes very little, because you will eat with it and sleep. Maybe with dignity, maybe, yes, but that is not life, that is not dreams, you want to live and it is difficult. She says: People are eating everywhere, why are you leaving? But if you are lucky, very little, you will not pay attention to all this, you will not see behind you and will find that time has dragged its coat under your feet. You will not say with astonishment when you open your mouth: a year has passed, then two, three, four and twenty years have passed. You have been robbed, so all you have to do is pull the coffin lid over you. Events do not happen in other countries, discussions do not come, or maybe if you are lucky. Of course, a little whisper will reach you from afar.

Once again my fear was proven right.,"I don't want to go into the details to much but. When I was a kid I pretty much learned not to trust and open up to people because you'll end up getting hurt by them.

Cut forward to my early 20's. I get a boyfriend and I slowly allow my self to open up and trust him. He's the first person I've opened up too since I was a little kid. He ends up treating me badly and sexually assaulting me multiple times.

After that I shut down again, learning that opening up isn't worth it.

Well I end up getting a new friend. I begin to trust her and eventually I open up. I allow my self to be vulnerable with her. And it turned out great. She was hugely supportive and helped me a lot. She became my best friend and I her's. 

I helped her a lot when she was at her lowest and she did the same for me. Until recently. Slowly she started pushing me away. She wouldn't talk with me and just seemed to want nothing to do with me.

Eventually I learn the truth. She thinks that she's a bad influence on me and that she's actually hurting me. So she decided to push me away to protect me.

The thing is she isn't a bad influence. I've made some poor choices but those choices were my own. She never pushed me towards anything and actively tryed to protect me. 

But now she's decided I'm better off without her and it hurts, a lot. She was the only one that I fully trusted. She's the only one I could fully open up too. And now she's gone. In trying to protect me all she did was hurt me. All she's done is reinforce what I learned as a kid. If I allow people in I'll just get hurt. 

I don't know how long it's going to take for me to recover from this. I don't know if after all these times I'll ever be able to open up fully with anyone again. Everytime I do I just get hurt.",NightAlternate,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jypxq3/once_again_my_fear_was_proven_right/,want go detail much wa kid pretty much learned trust open people end getting hurt cut forward early 20 get boyfriend slowly allow self open trust first person opened since wa little kid end treating badly sexually assaulting multiple time shut learning opening worth well end getting new friend begin trust eventually open allow self vulnerable turned great wa hugely supportive helped lot became best friend helped lot wa lowest recently slowly started pushing away talk seemed want nothing eventually learn truth think bad influence actually hurting decided push away protect thing bad influence made poor choice choice never pushed towards anything actively tryed protect decided better without hurt lot wa one fully trusted one could fully open gone trying protect wa hurt done reinforce learned kid allow people get hurt know long going take recover know time ever able open fully anyone everytime get hurt,fear wa proven right,night alternate,1767,36,night alternate want go detail much wa kid pretty much learned trust open people end getting hurt cut forward early 20 get boyfriend slowly allow self open trust first person opened since wa little kid end treating badly sexually assaulting multiple time shut learning opening worth well end getting new friend begin trust eventually open allow self vulnerable turned great wa hugely supportive helped lot became best friend helped lot wa lowest recently slowly started pushing away talk seemed want nothing eventually learn truth think bad influence actually hurting decided push away protect thing bad influence made poor choice choice never pushed towards anything actively tryed protect decided better without hurt lot wa one fully trusted one could fully open gone trying protect wa hurt done reinforce learned kid allow people get hurt know long going take recover know time ever able open fully anyone everytime get hurt fear wa proven right

Why people pretend?,"I am in the last year of my college and still don't have any friends to whom I can talk to. I haven't talked to anyone in these 8 months of lockdown apart from some text related to the class or when they needed my help. I dint had any friends growing up too. Sometimes when I had one or two it felt one-sided. They never try to start the conversation. You know when people are talking and when replying. In my case, it was the latter one. I don't know what to do. Sometimes it feels like I can do it but then after the energy wears off it comes back to the same sucking life. The problem is I always try to talk because they have many people to talk to but for me, it's hard to find someone.

Depression &amp; University,"Hey Everyone!!! 

First of all, I'm very much new to Reddit (!) and hope it's alright to ask if you all can be gentle with me if that's possible, please. 

I would also like to give my thanks for the existance of this subreddit; Thank you and I really appreciate the fact that people like us can share our stories and hopefully feel better and even better if there's a chance to read others thoughts &amp; opinions on my situation! that would be so awesome and helpful. I am very grateful even for the oppurtunity to just let this out - I think there's some healing in just letting it out. I just REALLY need to be heard and seen right now :(

I really, really feel the need to share this and get it off my chest as it's been weighing heavy on me for a long time now (I feel). Long story short, I'm a student studying at University at what I would call my dream B.A field. I'm 28 and have been at Uni for 4 YEARS now (!!!!). Where I'm from, literally everyone on MOST B.A programs (depends on your major tbh - as in most of them are literally 3 year programs) - finish them in 3 years tops. In my specific field, it is also 3 years (at my Uni it can be done within 3.5 years at BEST probably). So, already I feel so over it tbh. And, by my calculations I STILL have another 2.5 years to go...you can imagine how daunting that makes a person feel that's already suffering from Depression. Basically, doing a B.A for 6.5 YEARSSSSS.

Here's my problem - my issue is, I really suffer with (a lack of) motivation and it's to the point that I find it hard to function well aka take care of myself properly. I find it that much harder with school...and it dawned on me very recently that I just HATE studying. When I mean hate, I mean it with an absolute passion. This isn't a ""ugh, studying is boring"" this is more like "" I HATE studying; I am so bored, so unmotivated and hate it with the very core of my being"". I realize all of this must sound so stupid like wtf are you doing in school, in Uni if you hate studying?? believe me, I hate myself for feeling this way. I really, really do. I am not proud of it. This was something that...literally dawned on me and it took me this long to admit it to myself. I am absolutely ashamed to feel this way...I see other students peers in my major and they are some of the smartest people I've seen at my school; every single course - just amazing students. Straight 90+ (grade) students. That KNOW their shit. My school friends are in the same major as me and they're brilliant and ace every. single. course - no buts and or if's about it. Obviously, I cannot help but feel so incredibly jealous. And again, ashamed. 

Like, I'm studying my dream major - why am I doing this to myself?  I feel like I'm literally ruinning my life. Deep down in my heart? I KNOW I could have done way better from the very, very start. It kills me that I cannot get to the point of accessing my own potentional in my studies. And believe me I am not talking about shitting out 100's in every course! All I want is to do my BEST and hopefully get as high as I can. But even that I seem to not be able to do. 

I think what really breaks my heart is I know I am myself to blame. All I have is myself to blame. This isn't a situation where I am out partying every night and ""omg I'm having fun I didn't get to my studies haha!"", this isn't even a situation where I'm in a loving relationship that's consuming my life and ""I find it hard to balance that AND school""...it's not even ANY of these !!! It's literally me just fucking all this up. Having NO motivation at all to study. Like I said, I realize I have no one else to blame; not the professors, not the courses, nothing but myself at the end of the day.

I wish there was a perfect way to describe this feeling of ""no motivation"" in regards to studying - I just seriously hate it. I hate studying and I find it sooo boring and cannot concentrate at all. It is a miracle I have even gotten to 4+ years in Uni at this point. I just feel so over it. The whole Uni thing just depresses me greatly and gives me sucidal thoughts as it is - I was in talk Therapy for 2+ years and it was very much because of this (among other things of course). Now, being over a year and some change out of therapy - I realize that things haven't changed in this regard. 

I want to be very clear - I am the last person on earth that doesn't believe in hard work. I know that there is not way I could ever make something of myself in my field (or any other for that matter) if I do not study. I know there is no ""shortcuts"". I know that all my friends and student peers study and they study HARD. I just, sadly...**don't have it in me** and it breaks my little heart and I beat myself up for it all the time. The hard thing is I DON'T KNOW where ""to get"" motivation. This has literally been such a struggle for me actively for literally OVER 4 YEARS now. It's almost to the point of an existential crises - the only analogy I have is like knowing when you're thirsty - you just drink water in order to quench your thirst. But here, I DON'T KNOW what to gather and or do in order to ""quench"" my lack of complete motivation. 

There is also a part of me that feels like ""what's the point?"" with my lower grades, there's no chance of getting into grad school which is already sadly VERY highly competitive so that also is hindering my abilites to gather any and all motivation. I always sit down and these thoughts always arise, especially now that I'm doing this awfully difficult course - ""what's the point of this shit? I hate my current courses, they aren't for the most part going to get any better at all and I HATE studying...another 2.5 years of this...literally just, HOW?"". 

I promise you I am not ungrateful about school and the oppurtinity to even be in higher education.

Because of my depression  &amp; sucidal thoughts of which I have been suffering from on and off the past 7 years straight - I have found that I have lost the desire to date, lost the desire for relationships, lost the desire for children, lost the desire for friends &amp; having a social life and I found that all that was ""left"" so to speak, was school which I already hate - BUT what was really left was my dream carrer that I had been dreaming about since I was 16. Now, it feels like even that isn't left because of everything that I shared. It just breaks my heart - like my soul's little heart on a whole other existential level. I wanted this dream carrer more than a Husband. More than kids. It is and has always been everything to me...yet now I cannot even study and even hate it.

**I am SO LOST. I have literally no idea what to do.**

I feel like no one gets it. No one even respects that fact that I have depression - when I share, I am met with things like ""I don't know what to tell you"" and or ""I don't believe you"" by my own family. They're also ashamed of me. When I was in Therapy they wouldn't even dare say so to my own brother much less extended family. When I shared with my friends at FIRST they were supportive but then they made fun of me and judged me heavily for it. It really sucks. 

Please let me know what you think - I'd love to hear your thoughts!

The Sum of My Life,"I realized the reality of my history today at 27. My mother was the daughter of an alcoholic woman beater and horrible father, a young submissive mother, and was always overshadowed by her sister. She became an unfeeling person focused solely on financial success due to that. My father was the son of a poor man jealous of his rich brothers, a woman taken for granted but with no voice, a druggie sister, and another sister in law who committed suicide who was my best friend for a time. He became a one tracked drug addict who destroyed his body and mind, and is now but a shell of his former self. I hate them both. They're not to blame. They did the best they could for me. I sit with them. Enjoy holidays. Pass the years. But I want to curse my fate. The only catharsis for me is a relationship; the one thing I don't know how to form because no one ever got close to me as kid, so now I'm stuck in a perpetual inability to open up to anyone. I have no motivation though I work hard. I hate people though I have friends. I want to die though I strive to live. I feel the whirlpool of existence dragging my insignificant life down in circles towards its' abysmal bottom. Being a sponsored athlete, joining the army, being a major drug dealer, having amazing experiences all over the world. None of it has fulfilled me . So I wait on someone that can fulfill me. Someone it seems will never come. Because I've done all I can on my own.

Is anyone scared to talk to a therapist?,"I think I had depression for 15+ years without realizing how bad it was at times. Sometimes I have really bad days, weeks, months, sometimes I feel almost normal. I had a really bad phase a few years ago, neglected myself to the point of having matted hair and sleeping 12+ hours (which is too much for me when I’m out of depressive episodes), had panic attacks and really bad anxiety. It’s weird for me now, it’s like I wasn’t myself, I don’t act like that when I’m feeling okay. 
As I grew older I realized how messed up I was, so I started seeking for a therapist, but I’m scared shitless. I don’t want to open up to a completely random person.

Depressed,"Title says it all and given how challenging my life is most wouldn’t be surprised I’m depressed.

That said I haven’t been depressed in past. Just really really stressed. I have a massive mortgage, non functioning wife due to incredibly severe mental illness and job has been on line for while.

I’ve basically been single parent, done all the school lunches, drop offs, pick ups, house cleaning, washing, birthday party organising, sports etc etc and managed to keep our house for almost 10 years now. I haven’t taken leave from work in over 4 years as I need to cash it in each year to make ends meet. I have been very lucky where I can work from home and hours have been flexible. Very high stress job though. 

I’ve always just ran on ‘do the best I can’ and ‘If nothing else keep on top of the little things like washing cooking school lunches etc. I’ve stayed fit and our little one has thrived, doing well at school and somehow I’ve managed to keep social things together which is tricky when you have someone stark raving crazy in the family.

I’m not up for advise on how to make my wife better. We’ve tried everything and I’m over trying to change a situation which is very clear to all now as being totally outside our control. 

What is in my control is how manage situation and keep things together. 

Somethings shifted in last week. Now isn’t stressful just seems what’s the point... don’t feel like cleaning. Don’t feel like taking little one to park although I still do. Nothing is fun. Life seems really crap.

There a person that just completely broke me,"I used to be best friends with this person, I always knew we were more than that I had feelings for her and she had feelings for me. We used to do everything together I would tell her everything and she would tell me everything, I felt comfortable with her, she was somebody who I could let my guard down and talk to with, somebody who I could cry to without them judging me. I ended up telling her I had feelings for her and she told me that she did too but she thought it would mess with our friendship if we did date and something were to happen. I disagreed but I settled with her terms. And after that night she ghosted me. I tried to talk to her and hang out with her she would respond but it would be brief, she would say she’s busy or she just can’t talk. Eventually I just gave up. And she only gave me one option and that was to assume she ghosted me because I told her how I felt. I used to trust people so easily now I can’t trust anybody. It’s started to ruin relationships, even the people I’ve dated and gotten really close to I don’t trust them, all I can think about is them doing the same thing she did. And I tried to get over it but I just can’t, I just tried forgetting her and that didn’t work. I tried hating her but I can’t because she’s actually a great person and it wasn’t even her being rude to me it’s just me being to sensitive, so I can only blame myself.

I just can't do this anymore.,"I'm a 17 year old student from India preparing for an extremely competitive exam. I used to be a really good student until covid happened. Before covid, I was one of those students that just got grades without studying much. After covid, I sort of just let go and my life was so boring and I was so demotivated that I couldn't seem to focus or take interest in anything. Mid September I had a huge panic attack. I was so overwhelmed about all the time that I wasted, I started crying and I couldn't stop. I studied harder than I've ever studied in my life. I put in 16 (sometimes 18-19) hours of work a day and I just didn't feel like I deserved to eat or sleep because of all the time I had previously wasted. The more I studied, the worse my grades got. And this is still happening. I led myself on to believe that I can do this. I changed my study pattern, time, Material, etc. ABSOLUTELY NOTHING SEEMS TO HELP. talked to my teachers about it. They just tell me to not be stressed. Like it's just that easy. I constantly have thoughts of self harm and I just see no way through this. Btw I'm studying for something that I genuinely have interest in. I'm even scared to open my books because I know I'll get questions wrong and just have a breakdown. This fear has grown so big that I actually threw up one day because of how stresed I was. My hands start shaking when I'm giving a mock test. I'm just so tired. I don't want to do this anymore.

Is there something wrong with me or am I just being a teen?,"I  don't know if I'm just being a teenager or if I actually have some mental issues. Or maybe am I just exhausted and burned out?

For context, my sadness and depressive thoughts  mainly come from being extremly overwhelmed with school, thinking about my relationship with my family, thinking about my childhood and just being overall frustrated with myself.

I have those big mood swings. One day I can be feeling motivated to exercise, study and work for a great future. But the next day I would lay in bed for 6h straight, crying, feeling discouraged and thinking about death.

It can also happen but in the same day, for example I  would feel okay the whole day but then I cry myself to sleep. I'm so frustrated that I  can't stay consistent with my mood and I can't consistently work on my goals. 

I feel like being depressed and suicidal is so normalized amongst teenagers and when I talk about my problems or write about them, it just feels like I'm being the typical hormonal and depressed teen. 

I'm not posting this to get ""diagnosed"" but if you have any ideas of what might be going on with me please let me know.

Not sure where to start.,"Hello. I am new here and have never really gone on this sub at all. I never thought I would suffer from depression,  but here I am. As a teenager (I'm 28), I was a pretty happy go lucky person. But as I get further into adulthood. My kind is totally different. I wouldn't say I have suicidal thoughts, but I constantly question what the point of living is. 

I think I need to get help because it is affecting my relationship with my wife and my family as a whole. My wife knows my feelings and she is totally aware of how I feel. My parents and sister and other people do not have a clue what I am going through. I just have no idea where to start. I've never talked about it with anyone because everytime I have in the past, I just get told things like ""just get outside"" or ""just force yourself to get out of bed, what is so hard about that?"". Stuff like that and totally shrugging it off. The stigma towards depression is a serious problem. I do have my yearly physical with my doctor coming up. Is that where I should start? See what she can do to help me or to refer me to someone? I've tried numerous natural things to try and help. But nothing is helping. I have lost interest in things I used to love. I have no motivation to do anything at all. Im tired no matter how much I sleep. I find it so difficult to wake up and get out of bed. I just needed a place to put my feelings into words. 

I apologize for the rambling. I just got out of work and just not sure what im thinking. I also apologize for any typos, I used my phone to type this out and my keyboard always screws up.


EDIT: I just wanted to add a few things I thought of
 Another huge reason I dont really talk about the possibility of having depression is because I always think that there are people worse off in life than I am. And that I should not be depressed because those people are happy. I have a decent job, own my own home with my wife, have decent savings. I am not in debt at all. And I feel like I will be judged and people will say things like ""what the hell do you have to be depressed about?"".

Gyms closing again in WA has me spiraling,"I've been dealing with depression and anxiety for years with so many ups and downs. I was finally hitting one of the highest points I've had in a while (started new medication that was finally working, seeing a new counselor, working out every day, steady job, living comfortably, good friends, etc). However, WA state in the US recently shut down all of our gyms again because of COVID. 

Let me preface this with I totally understand why it's happening, I hate it, but I get it. 

Not working out has started my stress eating again. I've started to gain back some weight after being so proud that I had lost about 50 pounds. My roommate told me she's moving out and essentially leaving me with our lease that I can't afford on my own. My anxiety has kicked up because of this and I've separated myself from my friends because it's telling me they actually hate me and aren't making an effort to see me. I barely have the energy to text them much less get together with them even if they were to reach out. 

I've tried working out without a gym but I don't have anywhere to run and it's dark before I leave for work and once I come home from work. My apartment is unfortunately too small for me to do any actual work out in it other than maybe some squats or bicep curls.

I'm just at a loss right now and am starting to feel so hopeless again. It's getting really hard to keep fighting when every time it feels like I take 3 steps forward then 5 steps back.

Diving Into Sadness,"I'm in the midst of a depressive episode that's so bad I almost can't stand it.

Been having physical health problems that are unfortunate in addition to running my regular gambit of mental health issues. I feel such extreme sadness that I almost can't believe my life is real.

Anyway, just wanted to post my thoughts somewhere. I don't have much of anyone to talk to about this right now. 

I'm experiencing hopelessness, fear, deep sadness, and a lack of connection to the rest of humanity.

I've dealt with poor mental health since around the age of five. I wish I could just have peace of mind. I'm so so so sick of this. I'm so scared I'm going to live the rest of my life feeling unhappy, disconnected, and ultimately miserable.

This is a dark thought, but I wish I knew for sure there was nothing in the afterlife because I would gladly end my life. Not knowing what's after/believing I'm worthless makes me afraid of going to hell, so I guess I'll stick around and be miserable here instead.

Raped as a child numerous times,"I often find myself crying to sleep. These nights been worse. Starting from beginning I was raped from 5 to 10 numerous times by family members (second degree relatives) who were literally passing me through one another. My parents (mainly my mom) knew everything. But she kept in touch with the families of the rapists as they were her family and she cared about those kind of family connections and deeply in mind she blamed me for being too naive to get in to trouble. She used to blame me in front of that people, punish me or humiliate me for the smallest mistakes. In one case when she noticed about an assault she beat me in front of my gramma, (the rapist had left sooner) I hid in a room, locked the door and cried for hours. I could hear her talk on my back very loudly toward her mom. Things like I was disgusting and I was stupid and naive and etc. I was 7 at the time. That one rapist of me was around 20. The rest where more or less the same age. My first rapist was 21 and I was 5. My parents both used to blame and humiliate me in front of others. I was always really scared and embarrassed when one of them was around. Everyone in family gatherings and among my friends and school class mates and even teachers knew how I felt when they were around. Like that wasn’t enough, when I turned 18 my older sister started dating with my first rapist (she knew what had happened to me) and bragged about it at home all the time.
My boyfriend of 5 years loves me. Unlike all my other partners he isn’t abusive. He shows his love and doesn’t ignore me. Actually he was the one who fell in love with me as I had always been in very abusive relationships and was hurt all the time as I was always attracted to very cold hearted men who humiliated and manipulated me all the time.
I don’t like myself. I don’t think I deserve the love of my boyfriend. I often find myself being really addicted to pain, to humiliation and to being ignored and rejected. Being loved doesn’t satisfy me. I keep getting attached to people who are cold to me, who reject me and don’t have enough time and love for me. I find myself doing anything to buy their love and attention. This is the only thing that satisfies me. I get attracted to ice cold hearted people and my only aim would be changing them in to loving ones toward me. Like I don’t see myself worthy of true and honest love and attention. These nights I keep finding me crying to sleep. It’s getting worse and I keep reviewing my rapes, numerous rejecting, getting blamed, humiliation memories. I wasn’t a happy kid. I was extremely lonely and I used to sit in a dark closet in my room I shared with my sister and escaped to my imaginations. I still do that everyday. I hide in a closet in my home for hours and cry. I wish I was dead. I can’t and won’t attempt anything any soon but I keep thinking if there was a button that I could push to vanish in to thin air like I never existed or simply be dead I would push without hesitation. I wish I was not born. Life is and was always painful for me. There are very beautiful things about it. Like fade spots in the black matted surface of night sky but they are not strong enough to help me go through it and they fade sooner than what I need. Music is pure beauty, Bach, Schubert, Chopin, my three cats, my love toward all animals.

I feel like the world is against me,"First time poster here. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong. I’d like to think I’m nice, though I know I can be mean, but that’s only because I’m bitter. I feel like the world is conspiring against me. My parents abused me over the sport of basketball. It’s all I had. I got recruited to play in college, but once I got there, the coach decided to make cuts. I was the last girl to get cut “because you were the last girl I recruited.” I just don’t know. I make the choice to transfer somewhere across the country, and suddenly instead of getting a fresh start, I’m stuck at home because of Covid. My best friend just suddenly turned on me bc I told her I blocked one of our other toxic, manipulative, ‘mutual’ friends. I haven’t seen a friend in so long because my parents will kick me out if I go during Covid times. Today it all came to a head. I was going on a run. I don’t wear bras because I just don’t. A woman signals me as I was finishing mile 2 of my run and tells me “You should start wearing a bra otherwise your girls are gonna tear when you’re older.” I just felt so grossed out by that that instead of finishing my run, I get in my car and drive away. Well, what else would happen that not even 10 minutes later, a woman backs out of her driveway and reverses directly into the back of my car. I’m fine, but the hubcap is completely shattered, and there’s a dent in the back of my car. The world is against me. I work so hard and I try so hard and I can’t fucking do it. It never gets better. I don’t want to live anymore. It’s all too much for me. The world always finds a way to humiliate me.

I'm tired of feeling sorry for myself yet doing nothing to change my situation.,"I've been dealt a pretty shit hand at life and am still currently stuck in said hand of shit. All I do is smoke and drink and sigh about how things aren't better, yet here I am drowning away my mind with substances as a way to escape, fully aware that I'm not helping myself at all with my coping mechanisms.

I have dreams of both day and night variety about breaking out of this dark cloud, about going back to college and reclaiming my life and pursuing the career I want, yet every day I still go to the same shit job to perform the same shit duties, only to clock out and return to the same shit living situation where I once again smoke and drink until the next day arrives and I do it all over again.

The funniest part about it all is that I'm only 21. I'm fully aware of how young I am in the grand scheme of things. I know I have time, yet it feels like I'm nearly out of time. 

I've recently developed a pretty decent plan for myself, but I'm still burdened by the concern that it won't work out and I'm going to waste my time and money for nothing only to end up in the same toxic cycle all over again. 

It feels like one of those things where I just have to jump first and think later y'know, where I just have to push myself to get the snowball rolling and things will just pick up on their own from there but that's exactly where I get hung up. The ""pushing myself"" part. Step one.

Resent my parents for not “getting it”,"I’m a young man 25, and hope one day to make it my primary duty to understand and help out my children in the future. My mother doesn’t understand mental illness, and consistently judges me and downplays how severe my situations are.

I have body dysmorphia, OCD, depression and constant anxiety attacks daily. Yet i always feels like she thinks I’m just being over dramatic.

I started to resent my parents cause my mother came from a healthy, stress free, family and usually acts like I’m just a burden. If i’m depressed or anxious it’s, “Just get over it”. My body dysmorphia has become worse since I’m balding and have gained weight from not going to the gym. “It’s just hair”... How does she not understand it’s more than that? For OCD I have emetophobia (fear of vomit) and she says “so what, if you puke you puke”...

Emptiness is heavy,"I'm gaining weight again... It's not something I can control anymore. Everytime I feel down, I eat to fill the void. It's always unending. I know I should stop but I can't. I want to have the body that the people I love would be fine with but this is me, and I am shit. I'm stuck like this. 

Everything tires me. I'm no longer doing the things that are important. Even though I know that I have to do them I don't. I'm losing interest in school. I'm losing interest in the dream I'm not even sure I can reach. 

""I should be fine. There's nothing to worry about"" but to me nothing will ever go fine. I hadn't been attending school for a while now because the truth is, i'm dumb and i'm tired. Tired of everything, tired of me. All of the shits are building up on my head and every single one of my thoughts lead into me realizing how weak and pathetic I am. I'm pathetic. A loser. 

I want to make my mom proud but thinking of this just reminds me of her ignoring the achievements I try to show her saying that she won't earn money from it and the way she never attended any of my awarding ceremonies with all of the students' parents around except for mine.. I know, I'm overdramatic but that's me. I want to love too but I'm always blocked by the reality I had seen throughout my life. I want to wear dresses too but my insecurity eats me from the inside, making me realize how bad I look from my head down to my toes. 

The nightmares of that shit october 2008, I have witnessed my dad rape my sister, threaten about killing us, the way he sliced me with a small blade for being a loud 5-year-old, mom doing all ways to kill him to protect us and the days in courtroom are making me sink once again. Back then, it just hurt parts of me, not letting me breathe but now it's just empty. Hollow, nothingness thats unbearably heavy to the point that I can't leave my bed. I know I should move on and that those happened more than a decade ago but I cant. I may have forgiven dad but I can't forget everything especially when mom reminds me of them every fucking day leading me to feel like everything is my fault. Only if I hadn't existed. 

I'm all fucked up, once again. I wish to die but anxious of the things to occur if I do die. Will you still consider me your friend? Will you forget about me after days?

No clue what to do at this point,So I’ve been living with my drug addict/alcohol mother for about 5 months now while I was saving for a place of my own. Things here are so stressful and so unpredictable...I’m always on edge and she also lets my ex boyfriend live with her! It’s a very weird situation and it hurts me knowing she chooses him over me at times. I’m finally able to move out with my Fiancé and we found a place of our own and we move out soon! I’m very scared to tell my mom because she’s going to freak the fuck out and make me feel so guilty. She’s also not in a good state of mind because she’s coming down off meth and she’s sleeping 24/7 and when she’s awake she cries and is in a bad mood...I seriously don’t know what to do in this situation. She’s going to make me feel bad for moving out before the holidays and I already feel like shit. It’s not healthy for me to keep staying here and I need out but she’s making me feel very guilty.

right now,"Hello, first post and all.
So i’ve been so irritated today.. Like, more than usual
I (24F) feel like it’s not only the time we’re in - I just switched to what is a better job, on paper, but it’s suuuch a jump from what I know and it’s intimidating, despite my manager being a very forgiving person. I wanna move out as well but I can’t (financial and familial reasons) and I have had bad anxiety since I went back to working my last job before the switch along with what feels like very low self-esteem. I know I’m getting bad again too very eerily as I’m breaking down again..

My friends are busy doing their own things, and I watch from the sidelines.
I have people who care for me and I know it but I feel I ache for someone to care, romantically in a sea of ones who want one-nighters here and there.
I feel I can’t talk to my therapist bc she sounds irritated on the phone last time we talked and don’t want to try - she’s great but I also had ADD and feel that’s where most of my issues lie, especially with exec. dysfunction, and she doesn’t specialize in any of it. My health provider sucks to diagnosing and it’s difficult to get outside care as it can rack up ($$) amounts i don’t have disposable.
I also wish I could lose weight..

I feel I’m reaching my bad point as I said and I won’t do anything [permanent] about it, but it’s def getting worse to be present,everyday.

How do I stop comparing myself to people?,"I just texted a friend of mine whom I haven't contacted in almost 2 years. She said that life is going very good for her. She is 21 like me, and she said that within the past 2 years she has gotten engaged and is now a homeowner! She also plans on getting married some time next year! I couldn't believe what she was texting me!



I am SO jealous of her! During a pandemic, she is living an amazing life, while I am over here having an average life that sometimes feels miserable! She is about to get MARRIED at 21 (or 22), and I have not even had a real boyfriend yet! Every single guy who I have ""dated"" just wanted me for sex! Guys who I thought were good ended up being immature little fuckboys! I know that she is lucky to be getting married at such a young age, but goddamn it at least she has had an actual BOYFRIEND who cared about her!



Anyways, as you can see, I love to compare myself to people. This is just a prime example. I even compare my own body and even facial features to other people! That is a very bad habit, and it makes me feel miserable! So how do you stop comparing yourself to others? Because don't get me wrong, I am happy for my friend 100%!

I'm on 80mg prozac and I don't think it's working anymore. Please help. I have a phone appointment with my doctor. Just need to hear from the community and talk through things.,"I tend to ramble so I'll try not to and apologize if I do.

I'll start with the disclaimer: I am not suicidal or in any danger of hurting myself or others. The ""help"" in the title is in regard to my general current situation described below. I have a phone call with my doctor scheduled, I just want to hear from the community.

Been on fluoxetine for 2 years. Felt ok when I started, not 100% happy, but certainly a difference in mood.

Throughout the last 2 years, although not suicidal or ""depressed,"" I gradually found myself losing all interest in hobbies. I didn't hate my life, I just didn't care.

In response I then went up to 60mg earlier this year and still nothing. No interest in books, music, games, movies, working on my car, even going out with friends. All things I was able to do while early on in my treatment.

Went up to 80mg a month ago. No enjoyment in anything. No willpower or drive to go to work, no aspirations or goals, drowning in debt and ignoring the letters/calls/emails for late payments. Just completely checked out, indifferent to everything, absolute lack of caring about my well-being. I physically cannot find the whatever to sit down and play a video game, read a book, put on a record. Most days I can barely get myself up to feed myself.

I still follow my prescription. 80mg fluoxetine, 40mg generic adderall in morning. 20-40mg generic adderall at noon. 50mg naltrexone before bed. 10mg alprazolam as needed for anxiety but I'm so completely apathetic these days that even anxiety isn't an issue because I never leave the house so I rarely touch that.

I am an alcoholic, hence the naltrexone. I've cut back my drinking significantly as I know it affects the fluoxetine. During a relapse night is the only time I feel the drive to play a game or music which is of course dangerous not only because of the medication but also of my brain associating hobbies with alcohol that I cannot enjoy sober any more.

I have a phone call scheduled with my doctor's office. I see the nurse (APN I think is her title). She is the only person I've spoken with in the psychiatrist office.

I guess I'm looking for guidance on what to discuss with her. As well as any experience of yours with switching to another medication if you've experienced what I have. Or any advice or honestly anything in general because I feel more lost than when I began treatment 2 years ago.

"Help me, please","sorry for my English, it is not my first language, but I need help, right now I am using an online translator, I hope everything is understood. I will do my best to explain my situation.
This year has been a year full of changes for me, I could say that for the better, however, lately I have had depressive episodes.
When I was a little girl I never had friends, I was raped, and I even suffered from bullying. I always had the need to start over, so I asked my parents to change my school. In fourth grade, it was the third or fourth time I changed schools, but this time it was different because I was able to make friends. I did not realize until years later, six to be precise, that they only made me feel bad, thanks to them my self-esteem declined every day, and no matter how much I told them not to bother with my body, they continued. I never made things clear with them, because after all they were my friends, and I thought that was what friends did. But like I said, after those six years, I was able to change schools again, for my last two years of school. of my ""friends"" only two of them came back to look for me, nowadays they are like my older brothers, I kept in touch with two friends (Girls) with whom I had never met before, and I also started going to therapy for social anxiety. When I changed schools I met my best friend, who has also helped me a lot. And that's how we got to this year.
I was able to enter the university I wanted to the career I wanted, at the beginning of the year I met a boy through my other two friends (the Girls), and I was able to begin to improve my relationship with my parents. Two months later, before the pandemic started, I realized that my relationship with those other two friends (the Girls again) was also toxic, however I wanted to give them more opportunities than they deserved because I didn't want to lose their friendship. but in the end it all ended badly. after that, I was able to establish the things with my boyfriend on my birthday. He makes me want to be better every time, so since I met him I began to be more aware of myself, to do things better and better, and to work on everything that made me feel bad.
However, as much as I want to do things right, I always fail, I am not good at anything, I am not intelligent, I have no plans for the future, I try hard in college and I always fail, I am not even pretty. I do not have nothing in particular, and no matter how hard I try, I will never have it.
and today, I really wanted to do things right, but failed again. I had tried so hard to do a job for college. and I can assure that I get the lowest grade of all my classmates. I start to have more frequent depressive episodes. I think I'm starting to tire my boyfriend. And I just wanna take bleach and die, But I don't want my parents, or my friends, or my boyfriend to feel bad. But I don't know what else to do, I can't stop failing and I don't even want to try now because I know I'm going to fail again. help me.",ru_th,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jynzd6/help_me_please/,sorry english first language need help right using online translator hope everything understood best explain situation year ha year full change could say better however lately depressive episode wa little girl never friend wa raped even suffered bullying always need start asked parent change school fourth grade wa third fourth time changed school time wa different wa able make friend realize year later six precise made feel bad thanks self esteem declined every day matter much told bother body continued never made thing clear friend thought wa friend like said six year wa able change school last two year school friend two came back look nowadays like older brother kept touch two friend girl never met also started going therapy social anxiety changed school met best friend ha also helped lot got year wa able enter university wanted career wanted beginning year met boy two friend girl wa able begin improve relationship parent two month later pandemic started realized relationship two friend girl wa also toxic however wanted give opportunity deserved want lose friendship end ended badly wa able establish thing boyfriend birthday make want better every time since met began aware thing better better work everything made feel bad however much want thing right always fail good anything intelligent plan future try hard college always fail even pretty nothing particular matter hard try never today really wanted thing right failed tried hard job college assure get lowest grade classmate start frequent depressive episode think starting tire boyfriend wanna take bleach die want parent friend boyfriend feel bad know else stop failing even want try know going fail help,help please,ru th,2999,15,ru th sorry english first language need help right using online translator hope everything understood best explain situation year ha year full change could say better however lately depressive episode wa little girl never friend wa raped even suffered bullying always need start asked parent change school fourth grade wa third fourth time changed school time wa different wa able make friend realize year later six precise made feel bad thanks self esteem declined every day matter much told bother body continued never made thing clear friend thought wa friend like said six year wa able change school last two year school friend two came back look nowadays like older brother kept touch two friend girl never met also started going therapy social anxiety changed school met best friend ha also helped lot got year wa able enter university wanted career wanted beginning year met boy two friend girl wa able begin improve relationship parent two month later pandemic started realized relationship two friend girl wa also toxic however wanted give opportunity deserved want lose friendship end ended badly wa able establish thing boyfriend birthday make want better every time since met began aware thing better better work everything made feel bad however much want thing right always fail good anything intelligent plan future try hard college always fail even pretty nothing particular matter hard try never today really wanted thing right failed tried hard job college assure get lowest grade classmate start frequent depressive episode think starting tire boyfriend wanna take bleach die want parent friend boyfriend feel bad know else stop failing even want try know going fail help help please

"M17, not good at titles","I grow up in family where my parents been arguing all the time, even for the smallest things and by that not paying attention to me ever. Even 2 weeks ago she ""find out"" ^((i dont really belive in it, but it doesnt matter)) that dad cheat on her and she kicked him from home to let him come again 2 days later, to this day she lurks his phone whenever he goes with dog or just leaving phone for some reason, so no love from home at all

&amp;#x200B;

Never had any close friend that i could really tell how i feel, like sure; i had 2 friends in primary school, then one in middle school ^(&lt;That bullied me in first class, mentally and physcically&gt;) and now one in high school but i still have to act like someone that im definitely not and mostly by that people look at me as i would be borderline boorish.

&amp;#x200B;

For like month i had some faith in myself after i helped one girl to not get hurt. She was thankful to me, talked with me and hugged me every time she saw me but after like month or even one and a half she just stopped giving fuck about me. I don't even think about something more because i dont find myself as even someone who would be attractive at any point, but hey, it was just friendship and i never did something bad, rude or behaved like dick, just talked as i do with other friends. But okay, after that i just wanted to deal with loneliness literally any fucking way, no matter how and at what cost, so i got myself to get some hooker, just to feel some even fake love, i don't care at this point and  i was quite disappointed when even sex didnt felt good, i felt that im missing the whole point of it, after all of it we talked for a while because we had some time left, honestly it didnt really helped out so for last 2 months i just keept chatting with people on polish chat roulettes but after all i found 2 really nice girls that i spoke to for few days, but one of them stopped giving fuck about me, not starting conversation and took few hours to answer, and second one just got  bored of me but whenever i wanted to do something together she refused.

&amp;#x200B;

Tried talking with school psychologist but he was just listening, like during hour he said 4-5 words max from himself that wasnt ""oh, okay"" ""continue"" ""don't stress"" so i just stopped going in here before second lockdown for schools

&amp;#x200B;

What can i say about myself? The first of all im fat as fuck, but im on good way, im slowly but constantly losing weight by beginning of August (just 6 kg's but i can't push myself to lose it faster), most of days i can't even push myself to do something more than attend in classes, lie in bed and play some games,i cant even find any new hobby for myself, during my whole life i tried dozens of them like programming, reading manga (&amp; watching anime), playing chess (im trash, just 850 mmr), modeling 3d drawing, playing guitar, capoeira but the biggest my problem is the fact that im hardly anxious that i will be rejected again as i did all times in past.

Moving during corona is the first time I've had suicidal ideation in years,"Everything is getting better here yet I know nobody and my parents just aren't super cool with the fact I'm a not a manly man who wears cargo shorts everywhere, golfs, and enjoys yard work like your average ass hank hill.

People you love are strangers, they are foreign to you.

Pieces, every broken seam seeps regret.
Pretending your whole, trying to get through. 
Your breaking apart, a water main collapsing under concrete.

Welding,"Long story short I kind of chose my career on a whim. I took 2 years of welding classes and have went through 3 welding jobs. I suck and I've been stuck in this rut since may of this year when I lost my 3rd job. I figured I could spend about 125$ and try to make a little firepit/grill and try to sell it. So far I have 2 frames fitted for welding, but one is going to have to be redone to make it less warped and I cut a few pieces for the frame wrong. I also have cut the plates for the bucket fucked up with a bad saw zaw so I'm going to have to grind the plates to make them the right size. The main thing about all this is I like welding, but it makes me feel so depressed when I do something wrong. I get really suicidal and something hit myself in the head to calm down.

I’m going to kill myself soon.,"Sorry for one of these posts but I truly don’t know where else to go. Plus, I prefer people not knowing my face. 

I’ve been depressed for a while now and I finally had that ‘snap’ moment. Not the suicidal ideation, but the willlingness to go through with it. I plan on taking some copious amount of unisom sleeping pills.

 I just need to find a date to do it. Thanksgiving is coming soon, along with my sister’s, father’s, and mother’s birthday. Then there’s Christmas and New Year. So maybe I might just wait until 2021. 

I don’t know if that’s a fleeting hope that somehow something will have changed and I’ll be better. I know it won’t though. I’ve been stuck in a cycle of thinking everything will be better off with time, a useless idea. Nothing has ever changed. 

I don’t know how older people did it. I don’t know how people who were WWII did it. They beat life and then paid life what it was owed. Now, life has beat me and I’m giving what it should be owed in 70 years in about 2 months time. 

I would say it’s been fun but it’s mostly been shit. Only some fun times. And even then those fun times weren’t always fun.

Should I start SSRI ?,"I've always had panic attacks for I long as I remember, but they were sporadic. 2 years ago I've developped general anxiety disorder, to the point where I started suffocating everyday and couldn't fonction anymore. I've talked to my GP which gave me benzodiazepines and told me to visit a therapist. In the meantime, I've developped acid reflux disease diagnosed by endoscopy, which forces me to have a very strict diet and if I slip one bit, I got the heartburn for days after. As I'm still young I'm wondering how my oesophagus will look like when I'm 50 if I'm having these frequent heartburns.

The good news is the panic attacks are gone, the bad news is I'm 30 and having a strict diet with no alcohol (I never was a big drinker, but food was always a comforting thing for me) for life is making me depressed, to the point that I can never relax. I've now developped a fear of eating and I'm a couple of pounds away of being underweight according to my BMI.

Opening up a bit,"Hi, I don't feel comfortable using my real name so I'll go by Andy. 

I just need an outlet. I've never felt comfortable talking about how I feel as I don't want anyone to think I have it worse off then the next guy. I know everyone has issues and everyone deserves inherent respect and support for such.

I have never been officially diagnosed with depression, I will not claim I have as such out of respect for those who do. 

So with all that out of the way..
I hit my lowest point recently. A few months ago, alot of things happened all at once and really did a number on me. I just had a car accident where both my passenger side tires were bent which was going to cost almost $1000. I was working 2 jobs and one of those was very toxic because of some of the people I worked with. Along with this I just started my first semester of college. I know all of that seems very tame to some of you. This is not why I'm writing this, its only some of the recent events that added up.

In 2014, my grandfather died, I wasn't very close to him but being my mothers father it affected her greatly. She soon feel into alcoholism and has been an alcoholic since then. I was 14, I am now 21. When I was younger I resented my mother because of the things she would do and the way she would treat my father, he wasn't a saint either but I didn't understand at the time that my mother was sick. I moved in with my grandparents about mid way through high school because of my parents constant arguing and my mothers alcoholism. I still feel guilty about leaving but I couldn't take it. 

Fast forward to 2018, my parents took me out to eat and told me they were moving to Colorado and wanted to take me with them. I agreed and moved, leaving my best friend. At first it was well and good, mom seemed to drink less, and the fighting stopped. 3 months later it was worse that ever, my mom would scream at my father, barge in my room at 3 am saying that he was abusive. This with a mixture of missing my friends, I had to move again.

Now its 2020. My parents live in Iowa and I'm back home. Recently my parents visited and my mom was drunk and sobbed about how much she missed me. Now I miss my parents dearly and I'd just like things to get better but my mother will not seek help. They claim they are doing better but that have a tendency for lying. I call my mom every once and a while but I feel that our relationship may be a little too strained at this point. I no longer resent my mom and I miss her alot but I don't know how to start mending this, she did alot of things that really hurt me but like I said, I miss them alot. 

I'm sorry about the length and the formatting, this is my first post.

i don't know what to do,"i was raised by a sociopathic father who wouldn't care if i died and a dumbass mother who hates people and chose to raise me isolated from the test of the world.  i barely know how to fucking do anything, and i'm fucking terrified of upsetting people or embarrassing myself.  i just got my first job, i'm starting work tomorrow (god i'm stressed out), and i spent like 20 minutes or something earlier today crying in the bathroom trying to cut myself.  i'm trans, ftm, and nobody in my life gives a shit, they all tell me to be a girl and tell me i shouldn't feel the way i do and they don't want to help me transition.  nobody gives a shit about the way i feel, i'm too fucking depressed and too much of a piece of shit to ask the person who's supposed to help me with medical stuff to take me to the place i need to go and help me figure out how to get a doctor appointment, i already have a bunch of medical problems i need to see a doctor about, let alone all the transitioning shit that i don't even know if i can get.  i asked my older brother, the person i've lived with since i was 17 (i'm 18 now, actually 19 in two days), to buy me a chest binder, and we won't even have enough money to buy that until i make some from my new job,  and my ""binding"" (if it even counts as binding) situation right now is kind of shitty and doesn't work properly, so i'm also terrified about that.  i don't know what the fuck to do.  i'm a fucking moron, i can't do anything right because nobody fucking taught me anything.  and nobody gives a shit about my preferences, i just get called a girl all the time because somehow everyone around me seems to think that they have the right to decide who i am.  i can't fucking do anything, so i at least want to just take my anger out on two of my biggest problems, my tits, because there's nothing i can fucking do to get rid of the fuckers, but i'm even too much of a damn pussy to do that because gore makes me wanna vomit, and tits also make me wanna vomit.  i haven't even told my soon-to-be coworkers my preferred name and pronouns because i don't even feel like it matters, nobody around me is decent enough to just make such a tiny change to the way they speak to me.  i feel like such shit.  i just want to fucking give up.  i want to take my anger out on my problems.  i want to fucking stop existing.  and i can't even tell anyone i'm depressed because they'll just get upset at me.  i tried telling my mom i was depressed, she believed me for a little bit then just started calling me lazy and getting angry at me, i tried telling my older brother i was depressed but he just said ""oh yea i think all teenagers go through a faze like that"", i've told him i have OCD and he didn't believe me (not only is it obvious to like everyone and anyone but i was also diagnosed with it), he didn't believe me when i told him i have erotophobia and he doesn't believe me when i tell him i'm trans, he's one of those fuckers who SAYS that they're accepting but then goes and says shit like ""you shouldn't feel like this"" ""i think you're just confused"" and fucking compares it to him being fat as if those two things have anything to do with each other, and he even has this thing where he thinks he's so smart, i mean he's one of the smarter people i've met but he tends to believe he's smarter than he is, he doesn't really want to change his opinion or think ""HMM maybe i AM sexist"".
i don't know what the fuck to do.  i don't know how to transition, i don't know how to get medical help, i don't know how to do anything right, i'm fucking depressed both because i'm trans and because i've never done anything useful in my life, i'm now being expected to do something important that i'm too fucking stupid to do, and everyone around me is a sexist cunt who refuses to just simply respect my feelings and give a shit about my pain and help me so that i don't end up wanting to fucking kill myself.  i have no idea what the fuck to do, i don't know how to get help or who to tell because i don't know anyone who wants to help or cares, and i don't know if there's anything i can do online to get help.  i have no fucking clue what to do or where to go, so i'm posting here as if it'll do anything.  i don't know if there's a better subreddit to take this to.  i don't know if there are any sites i can go to.  i don't know.  all i know is this subreddit exists so i went here.  fuck.  i just want to fucking stop existing.  (i mean i don't really want to kill myself cause i'm too much of a pussy and i don't believe in an afterlife and there are too many things in life that i want to do, but jesus i wish i could like go

/,"I woke up really early today. I drove my mom to the place she needed to be in for the first time. I grew up hating her, she’s so avoidant, antisocial, paranoid, honestly, useless. Shes out of touch with everything, lazy as fuck, never kept a job for more than a few days, doesn’t have to work anymore but keeps telling me how everything is supposed to easy. She doesn’t have any friends and has convinced herself that she doesn’t need any. She didn’t understand why I was sad for not having friends. She doesn’t understand why I would possibly want to spend time with anyone other than the family. She doesn’t find anything odd about me that I don’t have a single friend that I don’t go out at all cause she’s the fucking same. I hate her so much and I don’t want to be like her. But I’m turning exactly into her it’s fuckin disgusting. I’m so scared I don’t want to be like that but I’m a fuckin failure. I’m depressed for so many years I lost everyone but my family. I try to be nice to her and really want our relationship to be like other peoples but nothing works. We are so awkward. She asked if she should sit at the back when there are only two of us. I texted her that I got home for the first time and she said I did well as a praise in a really awkward way and I kinda just broke down. I have nothing I don’t even know what I’m looking forward to.

I'm trans. Depression is ruining my transition.,"Time and time again, I've seen dozens of people joyously sharing stories of how transitioning allowed them to overcome depression, find happiness, and embrace their true selves. People talk about how HRT instantly lifted their mood, how coming out let them cut out the people from their lives that were holding them back.


I haven't had that experience. Instead, I'm stuck feeling even worse because I'm supposedly doing the right things and nothing seems to help. I don't have the time or energy to fully explore myself. Instead, every little step just overwhelms me to the point where I put it off indefinitely. I feel like an imposter because I'm a girl ""in name only"".


The worst part is knowing that I have every reason to transition successfully. My family isn't the most supportive, but they don't hate me or outright reject my identity. I have friends, albeit all online, who are supportive and patient and do their best to offer advice. I have my own living space and enough income to afford to transition. And yet I'm making so little progress. I feel like I'm wasting an opportunity so many people would kill to have.


I'm just so exhausted. I can read and hear all the sound advice in the world but left to myself I'm never going to follow it.

Am I to blame for my depression?,"I have always been in a poor family, Mom got pregnant at 15 and at 17. we always struggled to have enough food on our plates, paying bills, and paying for college. 
I work to pay for my bills, and the ones of my family, I never have enough money to go out with my friends, I can’t afford having a partner, unless we have to stay inside always. No one deserves that anyway. 
I have two years left of college, until that, I have to keep living like this, I can’t afford going out, having hobbies, or anything. I’m so sad, I just can’t take it. I see everyone doing exciting things with their lives at least once in a while and I can’t, I just know work, college and an ugly house. I just keep thinking of all the things I could do at this age, if I was in a different position. I’ll finish college at 25 and I feel so bad for all those missing years where I just worked, and didn’t get to experience the world, didn’t get to fall in love in college, didn’t travel, I think I missed on a lot of things.  I live in a shitty town, with close minded people, I should have left, but I don’t have enough money to buy my freedom. Mom says I should be happy no matter my circumstances.

Hidden depression is still depression,"I'm not going to lie I feel like sometimes because my depression is not obvious to people who don't know me personally and don't know of my ongoing mental health difficulties (depression, body dysmorphia , severe anxiety, OCD) I feel like people won't be able to know that I am depressed as I feel like lots of people still believe the myth that depression looks like someone crying every hour of every day, staying in their bedroom all day, not seeing friends and so on. When actually for the majority of people with depression , and more often in clinical depression , yes lots of people do cry a lot with their diagnosis of depression but at the same time I feel like when you get into the deepest depths of depression often your mind shuts off the emotional signals from your brain because you're already hurting enough from the depression and dark thoughts , you want to not cry because  sometimes if you're feeling really shit you do anything to hold the tears in because sometimes crying actually makes you feel more in pain/worse. I hope you guys understand that someone with depression who doesn't cry as much as someone else with depression, is still struggling emotionally and their diagnosis is just as real and painful.

Thoughts about the real world....,"Its genuinely crazy how the world works. Maybe I am thinking about this the wrong way, but every day I wake up early at the crack of dawn to go to school. Each teacher is trying to shove information down your throat, so that you can use that information, (or at least some of it) on a test. Outliers, people with attention disorders, are sent to correcting schools, special schools, so they can be normal in this environment. Their parents just want them to be ""normal"" so they can have this information regurgitated down their throats as well. Hell, they even give their children medications so this can occur. Once you survive school, you are given a piece of paper, which in turn can barely give you a living while you work your ass off. My parents and I'm sure most of you guys' parents have told them you are depressed, they are empathetic about it, most of it is genuine. But at the end of the day, they want you to go back to work, they want you to go to the environment where you are regurgitated worthless material, and it is just an endless cycle. People wonder why the suicide rate in America is so high, people treat it as if mental health is such a big problem, yet people cannot figure out why this is. It is the fact that the pressure amounted onto our brains to do good, and to not dissapoint is immense. The mainstream media. Everyone watches it. Everyone tunes in to see the latest issues. It's all just a divide at the end of the day. Republican v Democrat. Black v White. It is clear to all of us, yet people choose to willingly partake in it. The headlines are so clear. WHITE man shoots BLACK man. It's so blatantly obvious that the media is trying to divide us up so they can get more clicks. It's called divide and conquer. Material goods. You attain them for personal gain and social status. Even I am guilty of this. You spend your hard earned money on garments of clothing with specific wording on them for personal gain and social status. Let's be 100% honest, people dont attain Louis Vuitton and Gucci because they actually like the design. They like it because they feel insecure and want to be validated. People leech off of compliments about their clothing, people feel insecure about themselves so they gain confidence by buying hyped and expensive clothing in order to bridge their insecurities. As well as this, the gap between the rich and poor is immense, a couple of people amass 60% of the wealth, yet the average salary in America is insanely hard to live on. When you comment about this, it's just ""socialist ideals."" Woah woah woah, I'm sorry for getting too political. I don't know. Maybe I'm thinking about this in a crazy manner, maybe the world isn't as crazy and fucked as it seems. Maybe I AM the crazy one.

Cant erase my reckless past.,"I can’t erase my reckless past

Growing up I faced bullying, lived in a family of drinkers, isolated myself in my childhood and I became very mentally ill. During my highschool years I was on medication and I wouldn’t take it regularly and experience major mood swings. I lacked knowledge of what is “normal” and this combined with managing medication and mental illness issues made me do reckless things without thinking about them. I got into to alot of trouble, never thought about my safety, did alot of dangerous things, encouraged and met up with an older man who was a substitute teacher, led on weird men, dressed awful, send nude photos to people I barely know, meet up with weird guys, let my older, married coworker seduce me, cut my own hair into a pixie cut which the hairdressers shaved it until I was almost bald, crash 2 cars (not on purpose but mindless driving). So many things I did I desperately, desperately wish to forget. I’ve changed alot in my life and no longer live that way. I moved away and am in the process of creating a nice, comfortable life. However I have flashbacks to these events and get panic attacks, do others feel this way about their past, I just wish I would of known what I know now, but I wasn’t exposed to being a high functioning person. I’m not perfect and still learning, but the way I used to live is shocking when I think about it now. Will my past carry with me forever or will people ever forget? Will I have to live with these regrets forever.",7363626baconater,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jyrd7l/cant_erase_my_reckless_past/,erase reckless past growing faced bullying lived family drinker isolated childhood became mentally ill highschool year wa medication take regularly experience major mood swing lacked knowledge normal combined managing medication mental illness issue made reckless thing without thinking got alot trouble never thought safety alot dangerous thing encouraged met older man wa substitute teacher led weird men dressed awful send nude photo people barely know meet weird guy let older married coworker seduce cut hair pixie cut hairdresser shaved wa almost bald crash 2 car purpose mindless driving many thing desperately desperately wish forget changed alot life longer live way moved away process creating nice comfortable life however flashback event get panic attack others feel way past wish would known know exposed high functioning person perfect still learning way used live shocking think past carry forever people ever forget live regret forever,cant erase reckless past,7363626 bacon ater,1498,28,7363626 bacon ater erase reckless past growing faced bullying lived family drinker isolated childhood became mentally ill highschool year wa medication take regularly experience major mood swing lacked knowledge normal combined managing medication mental illness issue made reckless thing without thinking got alot trouble never thought safety alot dangerous thing encouraged met older man wa substitute teacher led weird men dressed awful send nude photo people barely know meet weird guy let older married coworker seduce cut hair pixie cut hairdresser shaved wa almost bald crash 2 car purpose mindless driving many thing desperately desperately wish forget changed alot life longer live way moved away process creating nice comfortable life however flashback event get panic attack others feel way past wish would known know exposed high functioning person perfect still learning way used live shocking think past carry forever people ever forget live regret forever cant erase reckless past

My BF is struggling with depression and I don’t know how to help,"I’m sorry if this is unnecessarily long. 

My boyfriend (23M) and I (22F) have been together 9 months and are currently long distance. About a month ago he informed me his mental health was getting bad and wants to go back to therapy before it gets worse. He was in therapy for 2 years before we even met. He said it helped a lot and he’s mental health improved dramatically. Well his mental health is definitely getting worse, but he hasn’t gone back to therapy. I ask him every couple of days if he’s found/looked for a therapist. He hasn’t and I don’t know if I should keep asking. 

It’s also only been a month, but our relationship is already taking a toll. We barely text/FT compared to before. I understand it’s hard for people with depression to do normal day to day things and maintain relationships. So, I’ve been giving him his space and only really reach out to send him cute animated “I care about you” theme’d images. I also always make sure to reassure him and tell him how much I love/care for him and how I’ll always be there for him.

It’s been really bad this past week. He’s so angry at the world, he calls himself stupid and crazy, and talks about how much he hates life and people. He’s also been getting triggered by a lot of things, so the dynamic of our conversations have completely changed. He’s definitely not himself right now. I don’t know what to do, what to say or how to respond. I’ve read that I should not offer advice and just “be there for them.” I’m so frustrated and stressed, I don’t know how to respond to this. I want to be able to help. 

Today he called me angrily ranting about life. I didn’t know how to respond and was mostly quiet. That pissed him off and told me he’s not expecting me to cure him, but he expects me to talk him through this. But I genuinely don’t know how to respond or I’m scared to trigger him/upset him even more. I feel like I’m doing a really bad job at being supportive/comforting and it’s even harder since it’s long distance. I’ve been reading up on how to be supportive while your SO is depressed, but a lot of it sounds repetitive.

Don’t want help but,"I’m 99% sure I’ve been depressed since I was like 10 or 11. I remember crying constantly about how much I wanted to die (still do of course). I never told anyone though because a big part of it was that I feel super guilty for feeling like this, and also that I don’t deserve help because I’m a piece of shit.

My moms reaction was to call me manipulative whenever I cried about minor stuff, rather than thinking that something deeper was going on. Which I guess is my fault but still. I actually developed an eating disorder when I was 12-13, mostly because of this, and had to go to therapy and shit. I was too embarrassed to tell the actual reason (bc it was bullshit family therapy crap and I did not need my parents to know that stuff) so I just yelled a lot about how I’m ugly and want to be skinni.

Now my little sister is 10 and in therapy because she has severe misophonia and sensory issues, and apparently she’s super depressed as well. My mom was like, oh, be nice to her, she acts kind of crazy but she’s really depressed, try to help her.

And I have been, of course, she’s my little sister and it’s upsetting that she’s going to have to deal with the shit I’ve been dealing with for like 4 years (I’m 15 now).

But it’s just upsetting that there was zero sympathy for me when I got crazy mood swings and was crying at the drop of a hat and starving myself. Just ugh, you’re so crazy. Stop it.

I started (s/h tw) &gt;!cutting myself recently, although I’ve been scratching and pinching myself for a long time. I’ve been just doing surface level stuff with a pair of tweezers, bc I don’t have a razor lol. I tried to get the blade out of my razor but it didn’t work haha.!&lt;

I am so close to killing myself. I’m smart, get good grades, but I don’t have many friends because I’ve been isolating myself intentionally for 4 years 😎. I have a (mostly) loving family, and a great future ahead of me. I just don’t fucking want it. I still feel like I don’t deserve it. I mean, we always say there are so few good people in the world. Some people are objectively bad, and I’m pretty much positive I’m one of them.

Idek what to do anymore. I had a plan to kill myself on my 15th birthday two weeks ago but I couldn’t because I didn’t want to make my grandparents sad. But any day now my self hatred is going to outweigh that and I’m going to stop caring. I almost went to sleep in a hot car on purpose (like 2 months ago) but my dad found me. I was so upset that I wasn’t dead but I had to play it off like, oh I wasn’t asleep, haha.

I’m in therapy too, because I got into college and my mom made me go to 9th grade instead, so we’ve been fighting a lot about that. So now we’re in dumbass family therapy because she thinks I’m crazy for not wanting to repeat classes, and thinks that I’m far too immature to go to college. The therapist literally agrees with me but my mom won’t budge lol. 

Idk how to tell my therapist that I think I’m depressed, especially since I vehemently denied it when he suggested it a few weeks ago. Idek if he’s be able to help me because all the stuff I’m depressed about is based in truth. Is it worth it to tell him and try to get help? How do I do that.

My relationship with my hair,"I've been growing my hair out for over a year now, which I was happy to do at first because I had the energy to maintain it. That being said, I don't have the energy to brush it out anymore, especially considering the fact that I see absolutely no one every single day. My hair is practically just knots at this point and it's always falling out due to stress (not from other illnesses). So, I'm going to get a haircut soon.

I'm hoping that I will have my hair grown out again in the future. I never noticed how much my hair reflected my mental state, and I'm absolutely heartbroken that I can't take care of it right now. It just makes me miserable to look at it. Here's hoping that in about a year from now I'll have it grown back again, but we'll see.

I don't know how would I deal with if not for video games.,"I'm mildly depressed for over 10years now. It's when my father had serious accident (disabled ever since) and my fiancee decided to break engagement and go back to her ex just few months after dad's accident. These events crushed me and I was never the same ever since. I stopped socializing - basically at all at this point, I never been to a date since then, I never finished masters (quit uni), so I work meh job just to come by.. On top of it I'm taking care of my disabled dad and it's not easy as after he became disable he's basically angry at everyone and his ego never  allowed to show any appreciation for it - quite the opposite, I'm getting called out for having mediocre job, not getting wife, etc.. It just pisses me off. 

So I'm basically living this misery for over 10 years and I'd probably had started having bad thoughts by now if not for video games, which are real savior for me and good way to escape from everyday shit. And I didn't play that much of gamer back in the old days - I simply had no time, as it's been rollercoaster of socializing, doing sports, meeting friends, dating, hiking, etc.. Not I feel alive in world of video games and feel dead inside irl. I found two gaming buddies, we play games in party or talk games - as we don't now each other in person, don't talk private life at all - it's been working well to have at least some form of social contact. Video games really are saving me from falling down into deep depression - as while I'm playing I feel happy, I feel like not everything is shit in life and waiting for upcoming releases gives something to look for and anticipate - which is sorta a motor for moving forward.. It's not a motivation in life per se, but it's at least something to look forward to. 

I mostly enjoy RPG, action adventure and FPS games with immersive worlds and great narratives. I also absolutely love souls games - as fighting against all odds makes me feel like I'm overcoming at least some challenges (sadly not ones irl) but still having to challenge myself and overcome it despite unfavorable odds feels uplifting. Without games, I almost can say I'd have nothing but misery of existing right now.

I know people are having far deeper states of depression, but I just wanted to share how I cope with it. And perhaps hear other people having similar method of escapism. I've been long time in denial, and blaming basically stuff for everything going wrong, till I accepted it's nothing but depression and problem is with me, especially as I don't really care to get better when I think about it.

I hate happy people,"I'm so jealous of people having fun because I've melancholied my way out of all my f****** friendships, and have nobody to have fun with.

🎶Tell me why...🎶,"❌❌❌SORRY FOR THE LONG POST❌❌❌

Before starting I want to make clear that, even though I really not enjoy being alive lately (“lately” about like 5 years lol) I’m not actively attempting to kill my self, I’m just asking myself questions accordingly to my wiews on suicide.

I really can’t understand why am i still living.
My life slowly started to take a bad turn a long time ago, nothing serious happening, everything just started to get darker and darker way before I could have noticed, you know like the Boiling frog fable, my world started to feel more and more empty almost like everything around me was vanishing. I remember the day when i was struck by this epiphany, I don’t remember being in a particularly bad mood but I remember it was a Saturday because after school I was going back home with my sister. I stop the car in front of the house and i can’t get out, i can’t because I realise that I have no purpose and that it doesn’t really matter whether i stay in the car or get in and have lunch or if i would be suddenly transported a million kilometres away from there or if i die in that exact moment. So I stay in there and I start crying as the thought of my existential loneliness stars to form more and more clearly in my mind, I feel like i can’t breathe, like I’m drowning, like I’m being dragged down in the depths of the ocean and all the pressure of the water is crushing me and no one can hear my scream, i feel cold; and i picture this image of me sliding, towards the end of my live, down a perfectly smooth surface that keeps getting steeper as i try to hold on something but there isn’t anything to hang on. That was just the first of many cases of what we can call a panic attack (i guess?) 

Since then I started to reflect on the concept of suicide and it’s implications and I’ve came up with the ideas that I have today on suicide. First of all, i didn’t bothered to ask myself about the afterlife because that’s something I simply couldn’t solve so I worked with what I had from the perspective of the alives, and I didn’t found anything that can really be a good reason to not committing suicide.
What I say may sound selfish but i really couldn’t find anything which argues in favor of staying alive that isn’t some dumb concern about making someone sad or disappointed. I mean, how could that possibly matters if I’m dead? Actually, how can the grief of the people for me (assuming that someone besides my closest relatives would give to me 1 second long thought after I’m dead) can exist? How anything can exist anymore after that? Why me (a dead man) should worry about something that matters only to the world of the living? Why consequences that I won’t be there to take should influence my decision? Here’s the thing about suicide, you literally can’t go wrong with it. What will define that your act was wrong or good? Suicide is a pretty neutral act. 
Now you could say “what if things gets better in the future?” And I would say why should i bet on that? Why should i keep waiting to see if things gets better? You could say that i have nothing to loose but that’s not entirely true, I would still have to deal with pain everyday as i go on and things can always get worse in the meantime. The real thing is that waiting is not enough and of course I should do something to put me on the path to make my life better, but, assuming that i find this path, is walking that path worth it? Why should I push myself through all the struggle? Why should I put me in the position of failing to follow that path? Even if i end up being somewhat successful on following that path, why should i waste all the rest of my life putting together the pieces of something shattered beyond repair a long time ago? And most important, why should i have to put up whit all this only to become a sighting worse version of me after all the potential I had have been wasted in this unrewarding endeavour? I don’t want to live only to become the “less worse that i could get” version of myself.
When you choose to become a deadman nothing matters anymore and there isn’t anything more liberating for man than that.


The only two things that keep me from follow up with my theory are:
1. as everyone I’m scared of actually ending my life, not because I fear the afterlife as i said but because I’m scared of being unsuccessful and just causing me a lot of pain, or worse, condemning me to live crippled.
2. According to my thoughts the only rational thing to do for anyone as soon as they can realise this is to killing themselves and I find it a bit extreme. like, suggesting to everyone from old people to anyone old enough to understand this in middle school to suicide causing the extinction of humanity lmao.",_At0msk_,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jyr0nl/tell_me_why/,sorry long post

"The Medi-Cal insurance for my dysphagia treatment has been delayed for almost half a year. I cannot eat or drink anything and my swallowing is extremely painful, it has been going on for 3 years already. I'm only 15 years old, what should I do?","This problem began ever since I learned the techniques of burping from my cousin, I was 12 years old: it was the winter of 2017. During that time I attended a boarding school with a middle school education that lasted from September 2016 until 2019.

It was a very tough time for me, I was taunted and bullied almost every week, I was the dump truck for the popularity of others, and it only increased my anxiety which made me belch even more air. The schedule was absurd, every day I only had 20 minutes at most to finish my meal, and no more food was served after that, because they didn't care to bother: the parents aren't around to accuse. I often went hungry, so I would pile as much food as I can and finished eating it before the next activity. But it had impacted negative side effects on my esophageal well-being. To sum it up, don't go to a boarding school when you're 11 years old.

In the summer of 2019, I was lucky enough to be remove from one hell of a playground, and moved 550km away, where I attend my first high-school, the home environment (not the school, and never the school) assisted me to emotionally relieve myself, but in turn it spiked up my swallowing problems, which was already there to hug me unconditionally.

wOndEr hOw it WenT? On a beautiful sunny day of the October in 2019, exactly half a year after I left that damn school, I regurgitated my food during a tasty cereal breakfast on a freshly fixed lawn; the milk temperature wasn't how my stomach wanted.

Unfortunate events began crumbling after, a month later, I couldn't swallow as properly (not saying that swallowing didn't hurt a year ago) and every bite was like a trip to the ER after breaking your legs from the third floor, nothing helped nor relieved my pain: Medicine (it made the situation worse because of the hard tablets), therapy, special ""fluid"" diets, etc, nope. It gradually went from eating a proper thanksgiving meal with a die-hearted chicken broth in the heaven of 2015, to something that had to be carefully prepared and scheduled or I will die on a hospital bed, nevertheless, those options never benefited me in any way.

I've had a GI done while I was back in China, but they couldn't find anything and weren't convinced that I needed to get a Barium Swallow done. I had ""mysterious"" stomach aches whenever the food lingered in-between my esophagus, and more often than not I would find myself waking up in the middle of the night having to blow my nose with mucus full of what I had ate for dinner. Sometimes I couldn't breathe whenever I had food stuck, and etc, etc. The list goes on for so long I don't even recollect most of them.

For months, we visited doctors, and somehow none of them recognized that I had Dysphagia. Eventually, we found one, because the symptoms were becoming prominent, and so my father applied the treatment from the Medi-Cal insurance, and we waited. Fast forward to 2020, a year after, the insurance was still pending, as if praying that I would eventually forget about this and leave it alone. Spoilers, we didn't. We called them, and they told us to wait, but we already did. We still haven't found the resolution and I've visited the ER a couple times already.

There isn't anything special about this essay that I'm doing, I'm writing this because I'm desperate, I really want a solution, I feel suicidal sometimes because of this. The pain is unbearable; a needle poke felt like a gentle pat on head compared to my swallowing issues.

Finally Giving Up On My Dreams,"From a young age I had huge respect for military service men. I'd go to airshows as a kid and there'd be men from all branches of the military dotted around watching with everybody else. From the age of 15 I wanted to be a royal marine commando (i also wanted to be a bodybuilder). I started going to the gym at 15 and was well on my way to achieving both those things at 18 In terms of my body/physique and fitness. But i had issues with my stomach and bowels. Still do. Have been to the doctors a few times over the years and had tests done that found nothing. The other issue is im sure i have adhd. Which i have tried to overlook because I couldn't be  a commando with adhd, no way. So the beginning of this week i decided to go on a diet of only eating non processed foods, meat, rice, fruit, nuts. Tht kinda stuff. My insides have been the worst they have been for months. But it alternates between constipation and diarrhoea. My insides dont hurt but theres a constant discomfort where i literally have constant anxiety because my bowel movements are so unpredictable and i have never been able to establish whats food causes any of this.

Anyway, at 18 i was forced to go to uni, where things basically just got worse for me. I got a 2:1 Law degree. Which is good i guess. But thts the only good thing that came from uni. Im now 22 and been in limbo the last year. Trying to decide whether to get help with the adhd and stomach issues or join the military. It could only be 1 or the other. 

I can never relax. Nothing relaxes me and that probably doesnt help my stomach. But today I was relaxed. I woke up and had the shits. I was meeting a friend to explore some old mines so i had to fix it. So i had half a bottle of codeine linctus. I emptied my bowels as much as possible before i drank the codeine. And it sorted me for the day. But also got me high (ive done it before numerous times) and i had such a great day. I was relaxed all day and felt no discomfort in my stomach and bowels which was probably down to the painkilling properties of codeine. But i was so relaxed and felt genuinely happy for the first time in ages. Because i was comfortable basically. 

I finally decided i have to put my health first. And it sucks i cant be a marine commando but its not my fault, just bad luck and bad genetics (digestive problems run in the family sadly, thats how most of em die 🙂 ) maybe i can still be a body builder though. Though my mental health has kinda been bad the last 3/4 years and i have lost the drive for it.

I think I have depression,"I have constant suicidal thoughts (long before the pandemic) and had a very rough childhood. I have always been anxious and my life has come to a halt as of now, I can't do anything productive and overall I really hate myself, have body image issues and want to disappear.

I didn't come here for pity and I don't want to hear about your bullshit. I've heard about psychedelics and hallucinogens as a treatment for depression, and I was wondering about the effectiveness of this kinda treatment.

I brought my parents with me to yesterday's therapy session,"I'm(f) 28 years old and got diagnosed with severe depression past September. This will be very long and I'm sorry if it comes off like a mess. I'm not in a very good state of mind at the moment as it's all still fresh. Also English is not my first language and I'm on mobile. So please bear with me. 


I come from a culture where children stay with their parents until marriage so I've been living with my parents and siblings (m25, f15). My parents came to this country as immigrants but my siblings and I were born and raised here. 


I've been seeing a therapist since September and I feel very conformable and really like talking to her. I've told her how my parents are negative and worried about me seeing a therapist, especially one with a different cultural background. They think my therapist will brainwash me to turn my back to my culture. So my therapist suggested a few times to invite them to a session so she can explain to them what our sessions are about and what I'm going through. I was hesitant at first because I know my parents and their view against therapists. But eventually I gave in and invited my parents to yesterdays session. My mother was willing, but I had to practically drag my father to come with us. 


The session was a sh*tshow. They have this idea I talk badly of them to my therapist and doctor, while I not once said a bad thing about them. They (mostly my father) dragged me through the dirt in front of my therapist. They painted this image like they gave me everything a child growing up could dream of and I'm being ungrateful and selfish. I was crying the whole session and could barely talk while my father was saying how I only thought of myself and they let me free and let me make my own choices. 


Which is bullsh*t. I've always lived the life my parents wanted for me. My whole life I was pushed by my father to be the best at school and to be a good example for other kids of our culture. He put that responsibility on me and every time I failed to meet his expectations I would get punished, verbally and physically. I would get told I was an embarrassment and a dumbass. Whenever we would visit his side of the family all they would talk about were our (brother and me) failures at school and life. We never heard anything about my cousins school lifes. All they talked about was us. He constantly embarrassed us in front of his family and if we ever said anything we would get reprimanded for it. I got sick of family members giving us 'advice' on how to do better. I never asked for anyone's opinion but still they felt entitled to give us their piece of mind. They were always (and still are) involved in everything that's going on in our lives. 


I felt so much pressure growing up I developed failure anxiety. I've always wanted to study medicine and become a doctor but failed to get through the entrance exam. My second choice was studying Psychology, but that wasn't good enough for my father. So I chose something I never thought about before, I went to study Pharmaceutical Sciences, to make him happy. I didn't like it and tolerated it for 2 years. After that I told my father I wanted to study Psychology and he got mad at me for wasting 2 years and scolded me for not telling him before that I wanted to study Psychology. Which I did. I did tell him I wanted to study Psychology from the start but he denied it. My mother and brother even backed me up but he still didn't accept it. 


I then went to study Psychology but my anxiety affected me a lot. On top of that I got sexually assaulted by an ex. He almost raped me but luckily I managed to get away. Nobody knows about this except 2 of my close friends. All of this made me lose my whole focus and I failed most of my classes that year. 


I had enough of studying at that point. I was mentally exhausted and my self confidence was very low. I changed to another field and after 4 difficult years and a lot of struggles I managed to get a bachelor's degree in Pedagogy. 


I've never had the feeling my father was proud of me. He keeps saying I destroyed his dreams and hopes for me. He wanted a daughter he could boast with. A daughter who's a doctor. Someone high educated and who people can look up to. He constantly brings up how he had dreams for me and I failed him. He mockingly calls me a doctor, a pharmacist and a psycholog. 


I had dreams too. I truly wanted to study medicine and become a doctor. But he can't let it go. I can't even tell him he's the reason I failed at life because he never accepts responsibility for our wrongdoings. 


I've been feeling bad for years but I've always suppressed those feelings. But as times went on it got worse. This past year I've had a lot of comments by my colleagues that I looked bad and tired. I could barely sleep and I had days I had to force myself to continue working. I wanted to cry all the time. I had to hold all of that in just so I could keep working. 


I finally got my breaking point past September after I got a bad migraine that lasted a week. I went to the doctor and the moment he asked me if everything was okay tears started falling down my cheeks. I've been holding in so much baggage throughout the years it started to affect me physically. 


I've thought a lot about death and how badly I wanted to be gone. The only thing keeping me alive was suicide being a big sin in my religion. I didn't want to mess up my after life because of my messed up life here. 


I don't even know where I'm going with writing all this. Maybe I just needed to get this off my chest. Or maybe I just wanted to hear from others with similar experiences. 


I've been living the life my parents wanted for me for so long that I don't even know who I am. I don't know what kind of person I am. All I know is that I'm tired. 


I feel like I messed up everyone's lives around me by having depression. I feel like a burden. I feel unwanted. My parents see my depression as an attack on their parenthood. They can't understand why I'm depressed. I have everything a person could want, why am I not happy? 


I keep getting the same questions and I'm tired of hearing them. 


I'm tired of being blamed for my depression. 


I'm tired of being treated like crap by people close to me. 


I'm tired of feeling like a burden to everyone around me.

Life why are you doing this to me?,"Anhedonia and anxiety are the beast that eat me alive. Psychotic nobody who knows something. I’m alive and awake but i feel dead. Drugs have killed all the feel good chemicals in the brain and I’m constantly tense and panicking, i feel like I’ve had a constant panic attack since the lsd trip that threw me into my schizophrenic psychosis on march 13 this year. Where and when will i fond the answer? Why doesn’t my brain produce any feel good feelings anymore?

If it wasn’t marijuana or psychedelics, my escape was music. I only feel pain when i listen to music now , it sounds so flat and distant. Fuck this shit, I can’t do this on my own anymore. I’m about to be 20 and i already feel dead. 

It’s so hard trying to communicate, brain is sick and weak. I can’t handle this, when i woke up march 14, i had no idea a person could feel this way. Life can you please lighten up on me?

I feel like I’ve destroyed my frontal lobe but it’s like why do i deserve to feel better if i had good friends and family in life but i still chose to do this to myself.

"Alone, sick, and unwanted","I graduated college in the spring and started my first real job which is remote because of the pandemic. I didn't even feel proud about graduating and getting a job, maybe relieved but other than that nothing. The job is boring and I know I'm a lazy employee. I moved out of my parents' house in september to live in a new city with a friend. But she spends almost all her time when she's not working with her girlfriend so I'm alone most of the time. I know a couple other people in the area well enough to get a meal occasionally but they would think I'm weird if I asked them to hang out too much. I'm physically unwell. I don't know exactly what is wrong but something is. I'm weak and tired, constant headaches, my heart races and I feel lightheaded or out of breath just going to take a shower or something. I pick at my scalp constantly and am slowly losing my hair from it. I wake up disoriented every morning and can't get myself out of bed when I should. And I fall asleep during work even when I try to fight it, the sleepiness gets too strong. Even though my supervisors haven't said anything about my productivity I have trouble believing that they aren't going to fire me. I saw a cardiologist and they don't know why my heart races like this, they're ordering more tests. 

I was hanging out with a guy I met on Hinge for the past month and a half. We had a good time together and he was always very affectionate when we were together. I didn't know where it was going but since we never had sex I started to let myself hope that he actually liked me as a person or even wanted something real. We are both going home for thanksgiving and he is staying with his family for the next month. The last time I saw him we talked about hanging out when we're both back but he has been so unresponsive over text since then that I'm finally convinced he only ever wanted a distraction or some illusion of intimacy or someone to mess around with. It sucks because even if he doesn't have feelings for me he could at least care about me as a person, as a friend. But I don't think he does. 

I've never been in a real relationship and I see my friends make it look so easy, literally never being single or having people constantly interested in them when they are single. I don't think anyone will ever love me romantically, or even like me enough to want me to be their girlfriend. I'm not pretty, I'm shy and awkward, sensitive, and come with all this mental illness shit that no one wants to deal with. At this point I know I'm likely always going to have these mental illnesses. Living with my parents makes me feel lifeless and depressed but living alone basically does too, I don't even know if I want to go back anymore since my lease is up at the end of december. I'd have to find a new place and I wouldn't even be living with my friend anymore. I'd be even more alone and I already felt so alone. And it seems like this guy probably doesn't give a fuck whether I come back or not.

I do pretty much want to kill myself but I've been more suicidal than this before and somehow made it through. In a lot of ways I am lucky, I have a job, supportive parents, a handful of friends. But I feel like I have nothing and then I feel ungrateful. I don't know how to be happy. I do think that there's a good chance I'll die by suicide eventually, especially after my parents are gone and I don't have to stick around out of guilt.",Superstarella61,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jyq7pb/alone_sick_and_unwanted/,graduated college spring started first real job remote pandemic even feel proud graduating getting job maybe relieved nothing job boring know lazy employee moved parent house september live new city friend spends almost time working girlfriend alone time know couple people area well enough get meal occasionally would think weird asked hang much physically unwell know exactly wrong something weak tired constant headache heart race feel lightheaded breath going take shower something pick scalp constantly slowly losing hair wake disoriented every morning get bed fall asleep work even try fight sleepiness get strong even though supervisor said anything productivity trouble believing going fire saw cardiologist know heart race like ordering test wa hanging guy met hinge past month half good time together wa always affectionate together know wa going since never sex started let hope actually liked person even wanted something real going home thanksgiving staying family next month last time saw talked hanging back ha unresponsive text since finally convinced ever wanted distraction illusion intimacy someone mess around suck even feeling could least care person friend think doe never real relationship see friend make look easy literally never single people constantly interested single think anyone ever love romantically even like enough want girlfriend pretty shy awkward sensitive come mental illness shit one want deal point know likely always going mental illness living parent make feel lifeless depressed living alone basically doe even know want go back anymore since lease end december find new place even living friend anymore even alone already felt alone seems like guy probably give fuck whether come back pretty much want kill suicidal somehow made lot way lucky job supportive parent handful friend feel like nothing feel ungrateful know happy think good chance die suicide eventually especially parent gone stick around guilt,alone sick unwanted,superstar ella 61,3433,25,superstar ella 61 graduated college spring started first real job remote pandemic even feel proud graduating getting job maybe relieved nothing job boring know lazy employee moved parent house september live new city friend spends almost time working girlfriend alone time know couple people area well enough get meal occasionally would think weird asked hang much physically unwell know exactly wrong something weak tired constant headache heart race feel lightheaded breath going take shower something pick scalp constantly slowly losing hair wake disoriented every morning get bed fall asleep work even try fight sleepiness get strong even though supervisor said anything productivity trouble believing going fire saw cardiologist know heart race like ordering test wa hanging guy met hinge past month half good time together wa always affectionate together know wa going since never sex started let hope actually liked person even wanted something real going home thanksgiving staying family next month last time saw talked hanging back ha unresponsive text since finally convinced ever wanted distraction illusion intimacy someone mess around suck even feeling could least care person friend think doe never real relationship see friend make look easy literally never single people constantly interested single think anyone ever love romantically even like enough want girlfriend pretty shy awkward sensitive come mental illness shit one want deal point know likely always going mental illness living parent make feel lifeless depressed living alone basically doe even know want go back anymore since lease end december find new place even living friend anymore even alone already felt alone seems like guy probably give fuck whether come back pretty much want kill suicidal somehow made lot way lucky job supportive parent handful friend feel like nothing feel ungrateful know happy think good chance die suicide eventually especially parent gone stick around guilt alone sick unwanted

I imagine my own death,"I'm not sure if this belongs here but here is a summary for anybody who might read this.
Last year i went into the highschool entrance exam . i   had to take anti-depressant pills for 6 months (then my mom said i didn't need them . I obliged to not worry her) i had several anxiety and panic attacks during school but didn't tell most of them to people not to worry them not that i have a lot of people to tell. We move often so often that i haven't lived in a place for more than 1.5 years so the friends i did have ,i left and now i am unable to make friends since i don't care enough. I am currently  going to a science highschool which consists of some of the smartest students in the country and makes me feel like an absolute  moron. My parents  know about my attacks they dont think more of it not that they don't know they just dont want to understand that there happy and joyfull daughter is not that happy and i can understand that so i dont tell them anything, my brothers dont care. Of course  there is more to the shit pile that is me but i dont want to be a bore


 I have realised that i think about my death alot during  the times that i am alone (which is a lot more than i could ever imagine ) . I make these wierd scenarios  about me dying  how it would happen and what the people around  me  feel about it. The wierd thing is im ok with it . The only reason im not dead is because  i dont want the only people in this world who care about me sad . But im sure that in the next 4 years (until the university entrance exam) i will have attempted suicide at least once 
Im still not sure if this is me just wanting attention , my anxiety speaking or me being suicidal.  .sorry for blabbering

I’m living off Coke Zero and Pizza.,"Is this really the way to be living?

For the past year now, I’ve been living on my own in an apartment, no job, paying my bills with the little bit of money left to me from my grandfather which will eventually run out.

I haven’t really left the place in months, when I’m hungry I order a pizza that will usually last me 3 days, I drink nothing but Coke Zero, and my hobbies consist of video games, Netflix, and sleep.

I’ve lost 35 pounds as a result of eating very little, and idk if thats a good or bad thing.

Just here to complain,"I feel bad, worthless,alone,ugly,unwanted and over looked. This time of year is always hard cause we all want to cuddle up to someone. My best friend is just about to start dating a guy and I’ve never felt more alone (romantically). Not to mention the fact that I’ve been fighting with my sexuality (still am low-key). RIGHT NOW I’m bi, I know I like men but up until 6 months ago I was lying to myself and telling myself I would marry a woman and be straight as if it was actually a phase. So with the sexuality struggle I never knew what I actually wanted so I’m a virgin. I never tried with anyone but the girls in my town never liked me and I wasn’t out to anyone (hardly myself). And I’ve been on tinder recently but I’m not popping off with matches so i feel unwanted and ugly, guys I do match with literally text me ONCE and I don’t get a response after that. My friends last relationship was agonising cause she wouldn’t stop talking about him and how happy she was, and I was happy for her until I wasn’t cause it started to make me feel shit.

Am I depressed or just sad? Long Post.,"I’m a male. 21 years old. 

I want to start off by saying that I’ve been going to a psychiatrist and therapist and am currently on medication. 

Low confidence, extreme low self worth, social anxiety. 

Ever since I was younger I would feel hopeless and worthless. I would always think that I’m going to to die one day from myself. But I don’t think I would ever do it. 

Here’s the thing: my “depression” doesn’t doesn’t come out of the sky. It comes from my thoughts, and my psychiatrist even agreed when I said I think it’s my thoughts that cause my depression. 

I actually believe that I don’t do anything useful. I actually think I have no future. 

I work in my family business and I constantly think that one day I’m going to just get kicked out. My dad and uncle both split their business 3 years ago, and I’m feeling like my brother will split with me. I’m not good at selling. But I’m really good at the details and background work, but I never think it’s valuable. I never credit my work and I genuinely don’t think I’m worth anything. My therapist proves me wrong every week, but I still fall into the thinking traps. 

Every few weeks I’ll go into a dark hole where I’ll feel worthless and feel like nothing matters because I’m doomed to fail. My mom says “why are you so negative when I am so positive?” My mom is so amazing and can handle any stress, while I “break down” from stress...since 2nd grade. I always had breakdowns especially when I didn’t understand the school work. 

So basically I get almost all the depressive symptoms: hopeless, worthless, suicidal thoughts, sad, feeling of drowning, crying, pain in my heart and feeling like I can’t move on. 

But I have triggers: my dad was in a bad mood and said something mean to me. I internalized it and took an online quiz on careers for me and I answered no to all the skills questions and I felt like I had no good skills and got hopeless and felt like I was going to be homeless. 

Another trigger is when I see someone successful. Seeing my 16 year old brother being so great at selling makes me ruminating about how I’m worthless. Seeing both my twin cousins have wives and kids at 21 years old makes me feel down. Especially because I know I’m never going to be able to get married. 

I have no friends and I’m an outcast in my family. I hate parties, don’t believe in religion but nobody knows, I just feel like a bad person. I sometimes think I don’t deserve to live. 

But realistically I have everything. Loving parents, a roof, food, clothes, healthy. 

Except I worry about my future. I worry and I get depressed. But I don’t know if this is actually depression, but this has been going on for many many years.",Hcurab1234,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jympou/am_i_depressed_or_just_sad_long_post/,male 21 year old want start saying going psychiatrist therapist currently medication low confidence extreme low self worth social anxiety ever since wa younger would feel hopeless worthless would always think going die one day think would ever thing depression come sky come thought psychiatrist even agreed said think thought cause depression actually believe anything useful actually think future work family business constantly think one day going get kicked dad uncle split business 3 year ago feeling like brother split good selling really good detail background work never think valuable never credit work genuinely think worth anything therapist prof wrong every week still fall thinking trap every week go dark hole feel worthless feel like nothing matter doomed fail mom say negative positive mom amazing handle stress break stress since 2nd grade always breakdown especially understand school work basically get almost depressive symptom hopeless worthless suicidal thought sad feeling drowning cry pain heart feeling like move trigger dad wa bad mood said something mean internalized took online quiz career answered skill question felt like good skill got hopeless felt like wa going homeless another trigger see someone successful seeing 16 year old brother great selling make ruminating worthless seeing twin cousin wife kid 21 year old make feel especially know never going able get married friend outcast family hate party believe religion nobody know feel like bad person sometimes think deserve live realistically everything loving parent roof food clothes healthy except worry future worry get depressed know actually depression ha going many many year,depressed sad long post,h cura b 1234,2698,38,h cura b 1234 male 21 year old want start saying going psychiatrist therapist currently medication low confidence extreme low self worth social anxiety ever since wa younger would feel hopeless worthless would always think going die one day think would ever thing depression come sky come thought psychiatrist even agreed said think thought cause depression actually believe anything useful actually think future work family business constantly think one day going get kicked dad uncle split business 3 year ago feeling like brother split good selling really good detail background work never think valuable never credit work genuinely think worth anything therapist prof wrong every week still fall thinking trap every week go dark hole feel worthless feel like nothing matter doomed fail mom say negative positive mom amazing handle stress break stress since 2nd grade always breakdown especially understand school work basically get almost depressive symptom hopeless worthless suicidal thought sad feeling drowning cry pain heart feeling like move trigger dad wa bad mood said something mean internalized took online quiz career answered skill question felt like good skill got hopeless felt like wa going homeless another trigger see someone successful seeing 16 year old brother great selling make ruminating worthless seeing twin cousin wife kid 21 year old make feel especially know never going able get married friend outcast family hate party believe religion nobody know feel like bad person sometimes think deserve live realistically everything loving parent roof food clothes healthy except worry future worry get depressed know actually depression ha going many many year depressed sad long post

I’m looking for advices on how to cope with this issue. Details below.,"Hi. 
I’m 21 years old and I live in a shithole of a country in Europe. I’m a pretty average guy, used to have a solid social life in my teenage years, been in healthy(ish) relationships, had a lot of friends, so everything was quite normal about me.
However, I feel like I’m struggling in life and my mental health is just going downhill. This feeling has been going on for about 2-3 years now. I always thought of myself as a smart guy, did fine in school, so ever since I was a little kid, I knew I had a bright future ahead of me. So did my family. 

Well, that changed in these past times. I dropped out of 2 universities in the last 3 years. Moved in with my ex and had to move back home 3 months later because our daily fights got out of hand. I got myself a dead-end job, which is to sit in a store 11 hours a day and ask customers the exact same fucking questions. I’ve been here for 2 years now. My salary is a joke, but considering that I’m basically not doing anything, I have no right to complain. I always thought I had more in me, and now I just consider myself a huge, huge failure. 
I’ve come to the point where I have completely lost interest in everything in life. Nothing brings me joy. I’m neutral about everything. I lost the ability to develop romantic feelings. I’m lonely but I love being alone. The only two things I enjoy is music and smoking weed with my friends who sticked around. I feel like I fucked my whole life up, even though I had potential in me. 

Now that I’ve finished my whining, I want to ask you people about one specific problem. I’ve been having issues with my stomach through all this time. I wake up every morning - literally every morning - feeling sick, I sometimes throw up, and it never stops. I could puke anytime I want. I have zero appetite and I barely eat. It never stops and I can’t live with it. I hate waking up every day, knowing I have to deal with this shit. I’ve tried visiting a doctor but it proved to be pointless. I know it’s a nerve based issue. I stress and overthink a lot, that’s when I feel it the most. Has any of you experienced a similar problem? If so, how’d you manage to cope with it? I really want to make it better. I love food but I can’t eat unless I’m high. I want my appetite back.

Really sorry for the long text, I just needed to let it out somehow.

Did I do something wrong?,"I struggle with depression and anxiety. I have therapy at the moment, and I also think it would be beneficial for my partner to have therapy, too. 

They don’t have a history of self harm, but they told me they were diagnosed with depression from their past therapist. I contacted their parents and asked them if they could try to get them into therapy. They’re often sad and down on themselves and claim they have anger issues, and I don’t want that stuff to worsen. After I told them, they said that they don’t think therapy will help them because the past two times didn’t help. I told them that they can always change their plan or course of action with therapy and that I know it can feel like a chore, but it helps. It helps, even if it feels like a little. 

They told me they didn’t want to. I feel defeated. I really don’t want their mental health to decline. Did I do something wrong? Was it bad for me to try to get them help? I feel really bad about it. I feel horrible. I just want them to get help I really do. I want them to be happy as long as they can. I love them. Did I do something wrong? Am I bad?

5150 in my Medical Records- I Feel Like I am Being Punished for Being Depressed/ Anxious,"Hi everyone,

I am currently considering switching career paths to something new.

When I was in college, I frequently had panic attacks due to my high levels of anxiety. During one of them I very dumbly spouted suicidal comments and the police were called. They took me to the hospital and I was evaluated by a doctor, who thought I was fine. I ultimately went home without being hospitalized.

Unfortunately, in my medical records it says that I was brought to the hospital on a 5150 hold (a psych hold in CA). 

I'm pretty sure I'm banned from joining the military, law enforcement, firefighting, being a correctional officer, obtaining a security clearance, or obtaining a pilot's license. Also, I'm sure I'll have a difficult time becoming a doctor or a lawyer in states that have licensing application questions that ask for specific mental health information.

I'm so depressed about this. I feel like having a mental health record is the same as a criminal record.

I feel so sick about this I can't focus on my work at all. Are there any mental work arounds to this? Thanks :)",RoundWindow76,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jypq2t/5150_in_my_medical_records_i_feel_like_i_am_being/,hi everyone currently considering switching career path something new wa college frequently panic attack due high level anxiety one dumbly spouted suicidal comment police called took hospital wa evaluated doctor thought wa fine ultimately went home without hospitalized unfortunately medical record say wa brought hospital 5150 hold psych hold ca pretty sure banned joining military law enforcement firefighting correctional officer obtaining security clearance obtaining pilot license also sure difficult time becoming doctor lawyer state licensing application question ask specific mental health information depressed feel like mental health record criminal record feel sick focus work mental work arounds thanks,5150 medical record feel like punished depressed anxious,round window 76,1085,88,round window 76 hi everyone currently considering switching career path something new wa college frequently panic attack due high level anxiety one dumbly spouted suicidal comment police called took hospital wa evaluated doctor thought wa fine ultimately went home without hospitalized unfortunately medical record say wa brought hospital 5150 hold psych hold ca pretty sure banned joining military law enforcement firefighting correctional officer obtaining security clearance obtaining pilot license also sure difficult time becoming doctor lawyer state licensing application question ask specific mental health information depressed feel like mental health record criminal record feel sick focus work mental work arounds thanks 5150 medical record feel like punished depressed anxious

How are we supposed to follow our goals if we hate everything?,"I think most of my pain and suffering boils down to this. I always ask this question in different ways with different contexts and never get much in the way of answers. 

I don't want to do anything. And it isn't because i sit around all day in my parents basement and play video games and don't socialize. I have my own apartment, a job, a car, a circle of friends, and most importantly I'm going to college to become a teacher. 

Why a teacher? Because it's the least miserable thing I could think of. I have to feel like I'm making a difference in this world and that people will remember me when I'm gone. That's the only thing that matters whether it's a good or bad legacy we will see in time, but I don't want my name forgotten. 

Every job, including being a teacher sucks to me. I hate working, and I hate living. Everyday I get up, cry in the shower, get dressed and try to put effort into my appearance, I go out to either work or to run errands and I try to practice social skills and combat my anxiety I've had since I was a little kid. I think I do a good job for the most part. I bust my ass at work, come home, finish all of my homework, and then cry myself to sleep for 2-4 hours. 

It never gets better. I don't feel anything but sadness, and I don't feel attached to any of the people in my life. I can fake a full range of emotions but it honestly makes me seem neurotic and edgy. I will cycle through them too quickly, I'll misread the situation sometimes, or fall into those ""oh I'm supposed to be quiet right now"" moments. I can be insensitive and I just play it off by claiming its sarcasm. 

I'm not autistic, I've been tested for that, I'm just like emotionally numbed except for anger and sadness. Which feed eachother in a loop. 

Right now it's becoming difficult to do any work because I'm just so defeated by this existence. I'm almost done with my English major and I hate it. The stories we analyze make me think more about how I hate humanity. It's all stories about whores and thieves and zealots and just horrible things. Why is college literature so fucked up like this? I have no problem actually understanding or making claims for the works, but they really just depress me. 

I'm disgusted by human beings and their hedonism. I'm so tired of people having fun at the expense of others and I'm so mad at people chasing success so ravenously that people like me are seen as stains of shit for not doing so. I don't want to do that except for the fact that it's the only way to be respected in this world. Nobody respects teachers... in fact most people make fun of them. 

I don't want to join the rat race, and honestly have none of the skills to do so, yet I don't want to continue down my career path either. Is life really worth it if I just cry my eyes out everyday and cringe at everything I see around me? Nothing about this country goes the way I want it to, nothing in my group of friends goes the way I want it to (I'm not the leader of the group as they would put it), nothing in my family is any good (all of my siblings and cousins fight and hate eachother at this point), and nothing in my romantic life goes good (still a complete virgin).

I suffer from anxiety/ocd which initially triggered my depression. I would always feel so depressed after the onset of my anxiety/ocd obsessions but these days it’s different.
I just feel so low even without anxiety or anything. I don’t feel interested in doing anything anymore. I just sleep so much. I don’t text or message my friends, I don’t interact with my family. I cry at least twice a day for who knows what reason.
I don’t attend my lectures or do any work. I just feel so upset and sad but why? My life isn’t that bad. I have a dysfunctional family, a few relationship issues and some friends that I’ve lost along the way and my anxiety/ocd.
I don’t want to die or harm myself but I just feel like my life is just so pointless and I don’t have anything to look forward to. 
I used to be so happy and chill and really social and always kept myself busy. I wish I was still in my teen phase before all this started.

"I sound like a broken record, but I really don't like who I am and my youth is wasting away","I compare myself to others and I come up short in many places. I am extremely lonely. I don't have friends at all because I am undesirable. I don't have any talents, hobbies or notable skills because I wasted my years focusing on things that didn't matter. I don't have a proper education because I am not mature.

I feel floored and crushed at the sight of others my age doing so much better than me. People who went to school with me are much more fulfilled and their lives are an adventure. I am quite pathetic and stupid in comparison.

I live each day suffering the cringe, disappointment, deep shame and anger from flashbacks of things I've said, done, or hadn't done. I have more regrets than I can count, more shameful moments than most people, and I am disgusted when I look in the mirror. If I reach old age, I will look back on my youth as a waste and a train wreck.

I am completely alone in my misery. Therapy has failed, medication has been ineffective, I cannot tell people because the public opinion is all about positive thinking and meditation and ""change your negative attitude, don't you know that if you believe hard enough things will get better?"". It's best if I just shut up.

And that's what I do. I don't speak to anyone at all. I wake up, go to my low skill and low wage job, come home, do my homework, and go to bed. I have never once been out with friends, I have never made a friend since leaving high school, I have never left the country, I have never done anything worthwhile.

I have a negative relationship with my family, I was born into circumstances that are insurmountable and unchangeable, and my childhood and adolescence were very bad.

I've wasted so much and I didn't have much to work with to begin with. I am a waste, I am pathetic, mediocre, lowly, despicable, disgusting, immature, retarded, slow, unimaginably stupid, and far far behind where I should be.

I have done worse than the average and I am a failure through and through. I failed school, and failed in every area of my life. I have no achievements to date or positive traits to note. I cannot change. This is what I am, and I cannot live with myself.

I don't believe I will make it to 30. Ending my life would be the greatest act of self love I could perform. I am not fit or good enough for relationships, for society, or for life.

things to do in my free time?,"okay so basically i'm in uni, and atm i should be following online lessons. the problem is i can't watch them at normal speed (i.e. when they're ""going live"") because of mental health things, and i'll be watching them when exams approach (bad strategy but its worked so far).

this leaves me with a ton of free time and i dont know what to do, nothing seems interesting and since i've deleted most social medias even my phone is pretty boring.

Does depression cause people to not really be empathetic towards others?,"I have two friends who are chronically depressed.

I think we get along... Because I have a lot of social anxiety... Which is just worsening with work, which causes me to be anxious about my future, as I have a lot of doubt in my own communication skills and a lot of times I just feel like maybe I'm an imposter in my field. 

I don't understand chronic depression, but I do understand depression as I sometimes get overwhelmed with my anxiety a lot, feeling worthless, dumb, isolated, etc... 

So when ever my friend talks about their depression or what they are doing to help themselves... I listen and I think I at least give some basic responses and support.

However, when I share my own feelings about my anxiety, I feel empty inside... I feel like I'm weird for even mentioning it... Or like maybe it's awkward, maybe they don't see me as that kind of friend that can share feelings with... I feel like maybe I'm being intrusive... And I don't know... I never even really get a response... Just silence... And it bothers me a lot because the things I'm saying, are thoughts that, if anyone agreed with or said to me, would hurt me deeply to the point where I'll cry for awhile... And now I don't know if they actually think these things about me with what I'm saying... Like when I talk about being an imposter in my field... That bothers me a lot...and I don't want people thinking that and I don't really want to express it... But when I say it, I have trust and confidence in the person to do so... And then I find myself disappointed. But I would like to talk about my feelings, and would love to hear anything... Even acknowledgement. I mentioned I was thinking about going to therapy, and I didn't even get something like ""yeah thats a good idea to help you workout your feelings/thoughts""... And I never know what to think...it makes me feel like I shouldn't talk to them at all about my feelings or anxiety... Even though it's something I wish I could express to people more so they understand my feelings and even reassure me. 

So... I guess I'm here asking those who are potentially chronicle depressed, what are your thoughts on this? Can you relate to my friend?

"Boyfriend has depression, I tell him I care about him, why does he seem surprised every time I tell him?","Just like what the title says, he has depression, sometimes really bad, sometimes ok. I tell him that I care for him but why is it that every time I say it to him he seems surprised like as if hes hearing it for the first time or something??

For example, the other day  he was going through it badly and I told him that I care about him and he goes “really?”….. I mean YEAH! I check up on him when im not with him and make sure hes ok, I try to talk to him or hear him out, be there for him and support him and I also try little things to make him happy. When I saw him the other day I told him again “ you know I care about you right?” And again he goes “really?”

The only thing I can think of is that he needs that reassurance and needs to hear it more but I dont know.

Is it hypomania or is this what normal people feel like?,I’ve dealt with severe depression on and off for the last 5 or 6 years. Something that I have been wondering lately is what do normal people feel on a day-to-day basis? Whenever I come out of a depressive episode I feel so much better. I feel like I have so much energy and can actually accomplish things. I feel like I am always talking really fast and my brain is moving at super speed. Part of me thinks it might be hypomania but I also feel like I could be functioning like a normal person but it just feels crazy/fast because I am so used to being depressed. I guess what I’m trying to say is I have been depressed for so long I forget what it is like to feel normal. Now that I am not depressed I can’t tell if what I am feeling is what normal people feel like all the time or if I am dealing with something else besides depression.

Just started on meds. Functional depressive (mostly) checking in.,"Got started on meds from docs after MONTHS of trying to speak to one.

On fluoxetine (prozac) and propanolol.

Been on them for a couple of weeks, haven't noticed much from prozac yet but I've heard it takes a while, propanalol seemed good for stopping me spinning out of control but the past couple of days have been rough with my mind really coming at me hard with its ""the worst case scenario is actively happening right now, has been for a long time and you're just too blind to see it"" schtick.

I've managed to get a small amount of cleaning/tidying done but my house is still a pit. It seems like 20 minutes after i do the kitchen every dish in the house has been used. I'll normally get fed up and do all the washing in the house every month or two, fold it all, put it all away then a week later it seems like every dirty washing basket is full again.

I really hope i quickly land at something that works because life happens too fast for me to keep up with at my current rate.

I've not had as many actively suicidal thoughts over the past couple of weeks as i had been (although that may be a placebo effect from actually starting to get help cause the last couple of days have been notable exceptions).

I feel like I’m losing my mind,"I haven’t been to the therapist in months. I was seeing someone I really liked, but had to stop because she ended up not being able to take my insurance. I tried to stay positive about it all and use the coping mechanisms I learned from my therapist to get me through the waiting period between leaving her and finding a new therapist. Except I still haven’t found a therapist. And it’s been at least a month.  

I’ve called and emailed at least 5 different counseling services in my city and I haven’t heard back from a single one. Most of them I’ve called and emailed more than 3 times. My anxiety is starting to get the best of me and I’m starting to think I’m being too persistent and the counseling places are annoyed by me so that’s why they won’t call me back. 

Within this past week I’ve been noticing that I just feel...off. I can’t really explain it, but I don’t feel like me. Half of the time it feels like I’m just floating through time as if I’m in a dream. When I do things (I.e. walking down the stairs, going outside to my car, cooking, washing the dishes, etc.) i have to stop and think about what I just did because it feels like I’m imagining that I walked downstairs or I just went out into the cold to my car. It’s as if I’m not 100% present and feeling very foggy/groggy. Or as if I’m not taking in the things I’m doing in the moment and forgetting about them a second later. I feel like I have no emotions, no feelings towards anyone or anything. Just numb. I tried to cry the other day and I got a few tears out, but I didn’t even feel like wasting the time or energy on crying. So I just stopped. But I still felt terrible. 

I don’t really know what I’m trying to get at with this post. Maybe reassurance? Or someone to explain what the heck this feeling is?

I’m a waste of space (for now),"

I’m a 25M and I have nothing going on in life.

I’m in college as much older than anyone else having failed a year already of college and failed a year of school. I hate my course and I hate learning and I’m not really attending or doing work, but it’s salvageable for now. I’m in my final year now, but it’s a prestigious college and I could make a bit of money if I do well and feel it’s too much of a sunk cost to quit. I’m also partly jealous of some people I attended with who used to laugh at me are doing well and I want to match them.

In terms of dating, I had a few drunk one night stands, but that’s it. I’ve never been able to attract girls in my social circle, so all my dates have been from Bumble. I have autism and can be nervous, so have had 10-15 first dates and zero second dates or anything after which just feels like a kick in the balls after every date I get rejected or ghosted - despite presenting different aspects of my personality each time. When I was at home from college about an hour and a half away over summer I met a very beautiful woman my age, who I got on with super well and chatting with was great. We spoke for several hours a day over a week via text - but then she went quietish before we were set to meet. She told me she’d been raped so cancelled. I sympathised with her initially. She was sending frantic voice notes and a couple of times said I sound like her rapist (but said it wasn’t my fault), she didn’t seem eager to reschedule either - kinda just leaving it to me, so I irritatedly said we should cut things altogether. Prior to her mentioning her rape, she mentioned jokingly (but kinda serious) she’d be appalled if I gave her an early kiss, but she was mentioning her one night stands and stuff which annoyed me a little (probably a bit irrationally) - i didn’t mention this to her. But at the time I found it annoying that it felt like she was throwing it in my face. We stopped speaking for a week. A week later, I sent her a message saying I didn’t show her adequate understanding but she said she was fine being friends but being unsure about dating for now and needed time but the events led her to go to therapy. I said I was super happy she went to therapy but interested in her romantically and would find it difficult to put my romantic feelings aside for her.

While I was aware that rape is severe and affects a lot, I wasn’t aware of how severely it effects people and just assumed she’d trust me because I wasn’t a rapist. It’s only recently come to my idea how big a thing it was to tell me this before we’d met. People don’t normally trust me with deep personal info, as I’m the strange guy that cracks jokes. I messaged her today and decided to bite the bullet which is three months later, just sending a message about how I liked talking to her. (I have been on dates since and had kinda put her to back of mind since then and haven’t really been too upset for a long time about other women rejecting me). She hasn’t responded and I don’t think she will as I behaved like an ass. Tbh I feel a bit pathetic, as most people only get super upset over people they’ve gone out with not matches on the web. 

In terms of family, I just have my mum who’s the adult I speak to. But she used to call a lot (2 times a day) which she’s now reduced to three times a week, but I still find that a bit troublesome as a lot of the time I don’t want to talk to people as I feel depressed. She’s annoyed at me today but I haven’t told her the situation on why I’m miserable but she gets stressed a lot, and threatened to travel to my university town  if I didn’t tell her why I was miserable this evening. I said id tell her in the morning (I don’t know if I will)

I was crying a few days ago for an hour a few days ago and I don’t really know why. I’ve always felt I’m underachieving in life and feel like a dick. I haven’t cried in about seven years when my grandma died but cried three days on the trot.

I do have a therapist to talk things over with, but still not much seems to work he did help me with some of the messages I sent the girl. I’ve been depressed for about six years and had three sets of antidepressants and six different counsellor/therapists and I’ve fairly consistently wished I was dead.

I’d feel a bit shy talking to my current roommates about my issues. I have two other friends who know I have mental issues and tbf to them seem to care and have offered to listen if I want to message them but have kinda ignored FB messages asking to go for a casual beer.

I’ve no desire to commit suicide, but I’d be glad to have a heart attack or something.

I’ve been miserable the past few days but I got out of bed, took a shower and wore clean clothes for the first time today. I’ve also started smoking again but I’m quitting from this instant.

I pray to god she replies, but i know full well she won’t and I don’t want to load this baggage on her plus I’d probably still be miserable if we were dating/fucking/married. 

I’ve picked up the Mamba Mentality book today. I’ve always been a fan of his work ethic and attitude  - hopefully i can develop Kobe’s resilience to my issues with life, women and studies (and just being a dick in general to this girl who was better than me).",ReadyKale305,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jykpx9/im_a_waste_of_space_for_now/,25m nothing going life college much older anyone else failed year already college

Should I go to a therapist?,"I'm 15M and lately I haven't been feeling myself. At the beginning of quarantine, I fell into a really depressive state. My life was (and still is) pretty good; I have a large group of really good friends, a girlfriend, and a really supportive family. But I'm just not comfortable with sharing with them how I feel because I don't want to be a burden. Now, school has really not helped, and I feel myself falling back into that depression. I'm weeks behind in a few of my classes, and I don't have the motivation to do anything. Not to mention both of my grandfathers, who were huge inspirations to me, passed away recently.

What also hasnt helped is my girlfriend. I haven't been dating her long, but I've started to really fall for her. At first it was going really well, but now it seems like she's losing interest in us. I ask her about it and she says she's fine, but deep down I know something is off. I don't want to be pushy, but she talks to me less, and just doesn't seem like she wants to hold a conversation.  I want to give her space and let her do her own thing but I find myself constantly stressing over her and how she's feeling, especially about us.

I've been nothing but good to her, and try my best to not stress her out, but it really seems like she's not enjoying us anymore. Normally I would just tell myself to stop overthinking it and relax, but I also recently quit smoking weed and now my anxiety is through the roof. I don't wanna end up dependent on weed, but life seemed so much better when I was high all the time. 

I really just need a hug and someone to talk to; I have years worth of built up emotions, but nobody I feel comfortable sharing it with.

TLDR; I'm dealing with terrible anxiety, death, and just an overall loss of motivation to do anything. I'm also constantly worrying about my relationship (even though she says there is nothing to worry about), and it's getting harder and harder to get out of bed everyday.

Talking to my (25F) ceiling,"Dear ceiling, or future husband or whoever the hell is listening right now,

I can’t seem to get out of it. The depression. I don’t know what to do but I’ve been fighting it for such a long time and with more and more time I feel like I’m losing . 

I’ve lived alone without family for six years- everyone is across the country and I miss them. I haven’t had friends in years either except one. The one who was my best friend - we dated. 3 years here. He’s the only one that lives here. Long story short, we broke up- and I dated a narcissistic person for a few months- then me and that guy broke up thank goodness. My best friend/ex has been back in my life as an amazing support system- but he has a life, a happy one and gets busy when I have nothing going for me day after day. I wait for his texts and support because I feel I need the support and hugs and time from him after years and years of being alone. And when we haven’t seen each other in days, I overthink and assume he’s tired of helping me. That’s my depression talking most likely. Hes just living his life and it can’t revolve around me. I know that I’ve been too dependent. On him. I don’t know how to break that streak- after years of being alone, of abusive relationships of being just tired after giving it my all.

I’m stuck. I’m taking a leave of absence from work next week for two weeks and I’m nervous that I won’t be able to heal in that time frame . I’ve laid in bed for the past day almost just doing nothing unable to move . It’s my fault I’m not taking action and pushing through. It’s my fault I’m not changing my way of thinking . I just want you to come over and hold me again like you have been doing. But I know you’re busy and I need to respect you too. 
I don’t know what to do. It’s quiet . It’s just me. I try to entertain myself in the comfort of my home because I don’t feel strong enough to go out and do things. Playing Pokémon on my tv, watching movies, coloring in the sea life in my coloring book, reading a book, it’s all just- I just can’t take it anymore day after day. The silence. The feeling I don’t matter. And even if I do matter- I don’t feel it’s enough to match the loneliness I feel. I need him. I need my future husband- but yet even I know that’s not what I need because I don’t want to be toxic for you and drag you down. Maybe by the time we meet I’ll be healed. Because I don’t want to bring you down. But for now I am just here. Surviving. Waking up, going to sleep. Barely.

I just feel lost,"I'm currently sitting in my living room crying at 3am. I wanted to take a shower but I'm scared I'll wake my parents up and now I'm waiting for it to become light out so that I can shower and go to bed. I have serious problems with insomnia and sleep procrastination and it's been getting worse over the past weeks.

2 years ago I was working a shitty supermarket job for minimum wage. I absolutely loathe supermarket work and struggled to get through my business degree without quitting. I eventually ended up in therapy to deal with depressive feelings, a good portion of which was caused by my job. I worked there for 3 years and then I quit to pursue my dream job.

So I went to school to become a professional gardener/landscaper. I had a good paying internship in the field and even though I always had to work twice as hard to prove myself because I was the only woman working in the company I really enjoyed my job. It was very rewarding, I was outside a lot, it paid well, and I got really good grades.

Then last June it all came crashing down. I had been suffering from inflamed joints in my hands for a few months and decided to check with a doctor because I could barely use my hands anymore. Turns out I have a form of rheumatism and the joints in my hand wouldn't go back to normal as long as I kept doing the job I was studying for. I was also starting to get aches in my knees and neck and I couldn't even open my hands anymore after making a fist.
There was no possible way I could do that job for the rest of my life, and to pursue a less physical job in the same field I had to finish the course, which I couldn't because I couldn't do the physical job, so I was forced to quit.

It's been 4 months now and I'm back working the shitty supermarket job. I just had 2 weeks off and coming back made me realise just how absolutely awful I find my job. I can't stand it. However there's very little job opportunity in my area and I can't quit because I'm still paying off my driver's license which takes over half my paycheck each month. I just feel like shit and I don't know what to do. I have no appetite anymore, I'm basically surviving on croissants I buy at the supermarket and tea and coffee. I stopped going to the gym due to working a high risk job and the fear of accidentally getting my family sick. I barely eat or sleep, when I sleep I struggle to get out of bed before 2pm, sometimes I don't get out at all. I just feel worthless at the moment. My parents or boyfriend don't know, they just think I hate my job. I want to start a new study in February but I'm absolutely terrified of it going wrong again. I just feel like a waste of space and while I don't necessarily want to die, I would like to just disappear.

I’m starting to become more depressed.,"This year has been really fucking bad on me and it’s making me more and more suicidal. In january I was raped and talked shit on my by ex girlfriend. In february I was ignored by all my friends. March I was abused mentally and physically. April I was cheated on, abused, talked shit on, had rumors spread about me, lost friends. In may I met the love of my life and things started going up from there. Until my parents started fighting and my dad cheated on my mom, they then split until this month. In June me and my ex broke up and I started dating the love of my life, but life felt wrong, I started taking drugs to cope with the pain and it just made it worse and now I get withdrawals when I think about them. In july my life started to seem like it was gettint better, until my life long best friend became fake and toxic and a horrible person and outcasted me and my sister. Then in august my om started having seizures and it made her look lifeless and those images are stuck in my head, she stopped but it’s still stuck. Me and the love of my life went to the Pocono mountains with my family and we also went camping with her family so I thought things would get better, until it didn’t. In september me and the love of my life started fighting alot and became a little toxic. In october we were fighting almost daily and almost broke up a few times. We were supposed to go camping again in october but never did, then my aunt died of coronavirus, then the love of my life got grounded for not doing school work and thats when it got really bad for me and I started to cut for a way to cope and I know its horrible but I can’t stop. In november, this month, me and her broke up, everything is just pain now. She told me countless times she doesn’t love me anymore and she’s in love with her ex. I tried to overdose on iron pills but I wasn’t strong enough to do it, I cut more and I can’t even eat now. It’s been 4 days since I ate a full meal, I’ve had half a Reese’s Peanut Butter Cup and a bite of a chicken tender and like 2 cups of iced tea. I’m falling deeper into this dark abyss. I don’t believe in god but I pray to him every night hoping he’s real, I have faith in him.

I talked to my cousin who's also a pastor with a ministry on mental healthcare and asked for advice,"This is what I learned.

1. ""When they lose hope, hope for them."" He told me that it's normal for depressed people to lose hope. But they can draw hope from us (as supporters) when we have hope. When we show that we have hope, it rubs off on them. :)

2. ""Capitalize on your 'breaks'"". This is a marathon. For us SOs supporting people with depression, we need to be aware of times when we can relax. Self care. We need to tale care of ourselves because our depressed loved ones draw strength from us. 

3. ""Realize you have limits."" This is connected to #2. We're not endless, so we need to pace ourselves if we want to last. Realizing we have limits would make us wary of our own health and prevent us from breaking down too.

4. ""We have two motivators - external and internal. External motivators are our friends, family, loved ones. Internal motivators are our inner goals, objectives.. etc."" Depressed people lose their internal motivators . As their SOs, we're probably their external motivator, and it's our job to help them find their own internal motivation.

"Why, life?"," Every morning, I reluctantly shuffle out of bed to my mum screaming at me to wake up. Depending on if it’s the weekend or not, I will either arrive 30 mins late for school, or stay home and do nothing with my life all day. I feel guilty for even thinking about trying to get better, trying to move forward in life. I hold so much guilt and shame from times in my life when I was a selfish asshole, labels and marks I can never shake off.

Oh and by the way, I am really really fat, I am 5’6 and weigh 94kg, from when I used to eat junk food and never exercise because I thought I couldn’t because of severe clubfoot in both of my feet that was treated very badly by doctors when I was a kid, where I couldn’t run or do physical activity for even a moderate amount of time, lest I risk excruciating pain for the rest of the day. But it wasn’t because of that, I’m just pathetic, no goals and aspirations in life, constantly paranoid and anxious about the future.

I play the guitar I suppose, a few other instruments too. But for a while now, the fun has been sucked out of that as well. My dad constantly pressuring me to play for his sake, as well as not having anything to play on guitar anymore, basically ruined that for me. I still play it, but it’s no longer fun to learn a song I heard once that sounded cool.

I know I am a toxic, shitty person. I don’t deserve to be around others, I would only ever scare them away with my bullshit. I deeply messed up my relationship with a girl I loved very much, that was three years ago and I’m still not over it. I feel unimaginable guilt and shame for ruining the relationship by coming on too strongly and not controlling my tendency to cry and isolate myself whenever we get into arguments. I don’t trust myself with a relationship after that one, history will repeat itself yet again, I just know it.

My relationship with my parents isn’t really ruined yet, but it’s getting there. I know they’re trying their best. They constantly ask me “what’s wrong?”, and “what are you feeling right now?”. But I don’t think they understand just how unexplainable depression can be. They seem to think of it as just ‘being sad’. It’s so so much more than that.

I’m 16 years old and I don’t even want to know what I want to study in uni, hell, I don’t even know if I can go in the state I am right now. I had dreams and aspirations during young naïve parts of my live, where I actually felt happy, because I wasn’t overthinking my future. But those dreams and aspirations have been lost in the sands of time.

Everyone in my classes at school seems to have the whole world in the palm of their hand. Everyone is over confident, smiling, being with friends, knowing that their future is going to be just great. I had friends, until I pushed them away for what, for me to be alone for a while?? What a selfish, nasty bastard I must be.

Nothing gives me emotions anymore. I can no longer feel joy, anger, disgust, surprise. I have one mood, and that is a blank, melancholic mood, that is colder than any ice or cold thing you will ever touch.

I think back to some bad things I did in my youth, and constantly ruminate over the worst case scenario of what could happen to me. Then I believe that that worse case scenario will actually happen irl. It seems that the true enemy in my body is my own mind and imagination.

I’ve been having very scary delusions and paranoia recently. Like for example, i’m scared of being watched by my school through my webcam on my school pc, i’m afraid of people looking through my window while I sleep, I’m afraid that, while sleeping, someone will come into our house and steal our stuff or worse, harm us. I’m afraid of being arrested, even if I did nothing wrong. I’m afraid that I have unknowingly installed a virus on my pc, so that a criminal can track my keystrokes and find out personal information, passwords, and my card number. Why do I care so much about all this? I thought i hated my life!

So why, life? Why am I here, when the only purpose I serve in life is making sure I don’t do something drastic like kill myself because “my family would be sad” or whatever. Because there’s not much reason to live if all I do is just float through life, not making anything of myself.

In fact, that’s the only reason why I stay on this mortal coil day in day out, is because I’m too much of a pussy to see what death will be like. I feel stuck between these two worlds, a purgatory, and I can’t get to neither of them.

I’ve hurt too much, and I’m afraid of what my future will look like. I’ve apologised, but I still feel the chains of guilt weighing me down from trying to live a good life.",Coopmel04,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jyncbt/why_life/,every morning

Food doesn't taste good anymore,Even my favorite foods don't taste the same. Everything is bland.

Short and depressed.,"First time posting here, but this is something that I have been struggling with for a long time and I want to get it off my chest (at least a little).

Some backstory: I'm an Asian male, 160cm tall and in my late teens. I was born premature and have been struggling with health concerns through most of my life, however none of the pain from surgeries or parental pressure ever bothered me, compared to my height. My height is the one, vivid defining factor that dictated my relationships, school life, confidence, etc. 

Ever since my peers started outgrowing me, the casual ridicule from people (good people, who often don't even know how much their words or jokes hurt) about my height slowly whittled away at my confidence and self esteem. I have always been social and outgoing, and play numerous sports, but those all too often are placed on the back-seat as compared to my height. It seems like no matter what I do, nothing can ever traverse the chasm between my height and that of my peers, and the sheer lack of respect people have for me due to my height has resulted in me slowly becoming more and more depressed over time. Relationships have been few and far between, and I am ashamed to say the experiences I've had as well as the countless comments from women (often casually) about my height has resulted in me having a low opinion of them in general, and thus affecting my empathy for them. Nowadays, I only look for hookups and casual sex, the thought that I could never be enough for someone due to my height being so deeply ingrained in me I've stopped thinking of having any emotional connection to women.

Nowadays, I go out, socialize, party etc but inside, no matter how many friends I make, how f**ed up I get at parties, how much fun I have, I can't stop feeling hollow inside, and angry that I couldn't at least be born average height, even just a little taller. 

The worst part of it all is the fact that I was even lucky enough to be born with good features, and just had to get the short end of the stick (literally) with my height. 
So many times I've heard comments like ""He's kinda hot, but his height..."" or ""I'd smash if he was taller."" I've even considered limb lengthening surgery but that's really the only driving force I have right now, the prospect of one day being regarded as a real human being compared to the midget I am right now being absolutely amazing. 

I use various drugs to numb myself to my feelings, but those brief flashes of happiness soon fade in the light of reality - that nothing I do will ever really help, even limb lengthening will only make me slightly taller at best. I wear insoles to increase my height, and with my height being so short, they help me be regarded as an equal at least by girls, and even guys. I can't be taken seriously or as a male by a lot of my fair weather friends, and honestly have been considering just ending it all sooner or later rather than struggle through life being mocked and disregarded for something I couldn't control.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe its a cry for help, maybe I'm just frustrated and this is me venting. If I try too hard at stuff and be competitive I'm ""compensating for something"", if I get into a relationship oftentimes girls' girlfriends, etc will give them peer pressure to stop dating me after realizing my height, and ridicule me constantly behind my back. The amount of times something good was broken apart due to this is crazy - an example being how one of my closest friends, someone I thought I could connect with during my highschool years completely ghosted me and cut off contact due to her friends making fun of me and her for talking to me. This hurt especially because I had been there for her when she was going through a lot previously, and wasn't even trying to get into a relationship, but the sheer fact that me, a short guy, could ever be worth talking to seemed to fly over most of her friends' heads. This incident in particular is what caused a lot of my current self destructive behaviour, not caring about university, just going out and getting f**ed up every night to feel alive, hooking up with prostitutes and talking to them, finding them better friends than most of the 'normal' women I know, too.

The funniest part is that online, I have the life I want to live, the whole package. I have a livestream I started, where I simply just look at the camera, smile sometimes etc and chat with viewers, and pull a large amount of money from the fantasy they have with who I supposedly am. There, they don't know my actual height, and thus only see my face and personality. I've had instagram pages with thousands of followers using my appearance. Its so shattering to know what just one factor invalidates all of this, that if I was just taller I could be that guy everyone looks up to, the guy that f**ks around and is the life of every party, the guy who has that magnetic attraction for girls around him.

But I can't, and never will be, and that fact hurts all the more for it.",sunrise_raindrops,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jyn6dn/short_and_depressed/,first time posting something

Depressed partner,"I met a girl who suffers from depression 2 months ago and everything was great for 4 weeks and after that, everything went downhill as her depression started to kick in. What sucks about it is the fact that she doesn't know if she loves me and she told me that she don't wanna be with anyone. I told her that for now, i would suggest her to focus on herself and let me be there for her at the same time. We're not putting any labels on it anymore. 

My question is, how do i get a reassurance from her that she knows that she's in love with me for certain because I'm contemplating whether to leave or to stay because for now, her feelings seems like they're in a gray area.

My second question is, is it normal for a depressed person not to know what they're feeling about their relationship?

You carried me..,"
After yelling in my face and telling me to get the fuck out of your house. I asked you if you wanted head. You picked me up and carried me like you used to. Maybe I’m crazy to think that it meant something. You were only carrying me to the bedroom so I could just lay there to help you get off. It didn’t matter to me though. Days before all of that I cried because I had wished you would of picked me up like you did before. You used to carry me back and forth around our apartment. It was something I loved doing with you. I loved those 40 seconds being carried in your arms even though it probably meant nothing to you. As I walked out the door and heard you immediately lock it behind me my whole body has went numb.

My best friend told me she doesn't care...,"I've been struggling lately... around a month ago I came close to committing suicide and since then I've been having regular breakdowns. Last week I tried to cut all my friends off, deleted all my social media and everything. My best friend has kinda been going through with this with me, I say ""going through"" as I don't feel like she's necessarily ""been there for me"". Sorta more observing and I don't really know what to describe her responses. They're not bad or anything but...


So I asked her today what she thought about ""this"" and she said ""idk"". Apparently her brain can't focus on more than a few things at a time and she's been moving house this week and has a lot of university deadlines. And then she said ""I either don't think about things or I don't care"". So I replied with ""so I guess you don't care"" to which she said ""sorry to disappoint :(("".


It hurts so bad, so fucking bad. I guess no one fucking cares about me at all. I don't get it. I cut her off and then she calls me the next day, she doesn't like phone calls for reference, to see how I am. I don't understand. Does she just keep me around cause I'm convenient? It hurts so bad, so fucking bad. I could be dead tomorrow and she'll probably just move on with her life like it's nothing. I cared so much about her.


She doesn't even have an opinion...


EDIT: she just told me that she does care but she knows if she tells me that I won't believe her. And if she says anything else, I'll twist her words to affirm that she doesn't care about me.

Having depression and pretending to be happy is like colouring a picture with all grey crayons, but others want to see more red. 
Depression allows us to realize our timely end, we don’t have those chemicals of happiness that allow us to go on through life smiling and ignore it. 
We’re the folks that imagine the train de-railing, the bridge collapsing while we’re under it. the car tire blowing... our end. It’s obsession. 
But is it? We all KNOW we die.

I’m very depressed, bi-polar, worse some years. The mania is what gets me out of the “funk” and I meet some friends though... 
. I’ll never have friends for long because the depression sets in, and I’m negative again.
Depression isn’t always what it looks like, that’s the thing with bi-polar. 
I feel there is a stigma towards people that take care of themselves that have mental illnesses.

depression forces you to take advantage of god by mistreating your dreams,"
my dreams come in shades of blue.
 
until i see violet, i wring them by the neck,

then collect crimson drops of inspiration 

from every cold, dying breath. 


was it right to gift me with dreams?

if they say god is flawless,

then why the careless mistake 

of trapping divine thoughts inside my carcass?


and if god does exist,

then i’m her forbidden mistress. 

i lure her into me,

and in rosy hues of light, the sky emits. 


while i’m to blame for the dimming brightness in her eyes, 

she gifts me with elaborate constellations.

admittedly, i never pay them any mind,

because inside the ground lies my only fixation.

My lack of emotion makes me crave numbness and I can’t escape it,"I have had a really chaotic last two years of my life. For context, I’m 21[M]. I’m on a semester off from university because of a mix of COVID and taking a spell to work on myself.

Before the last semester ended I got into a bunch of trouble in my friendships around campus. I was being rightfully labeled as a man-whore and manipulative. From my perspective, I never saw the things I said or did as manipulative. When I had a one night stand or casual relationship I always put my intentions in the open.

This always lead to situations where someone would begin falling for me. As I explained I can’t/don’t want to be with them I would fall into a cycle of breaking a heart, being labeled a whore, then searching for further acceptance through companionship and sex.

I got into some very very dark spots in life because of this. Near October of 2019 I decided I wanted to break free of the cycle. I broke up with a girlfriend that always painted me as emotionally abusive for walking away from arguments, despite the strain it was putting on me mentally and emotionally.

As the title says, I don’t experience much emotion. I go through the motions and play the parts unconsciously. The only time I “feel” is when I am extremely depressed. It’s never a feeling of sadness. It’s more-so a tingling numb that I feel start in my fingers and work it’s way to the center of my chest before disbursing throughout the rest of my body.

I hate being in these ruts, but once I end up in one I fall victim to my own desire to feel. I constantly let the negative thoughts of others live rent free in my head so I can feel that numbness for a longer duration that it should.

I’m getting ready to return to University in the spring. Old friends are continuing rumors about me despite me having little or no contact with them in the last 8 months. I’ve tried reaching out for help from trusted friends. I’m either ignored or turned away by them now.

Why do I Keep trying,"Hello, I figured you'd be the best to tell this to. Can anyone PLEASE help me know what to do next. Clearly no body CARES of what I make or do and I've been around since 2014 where I once began to knit and crochet. But everyone on Youtube is making fourtunes and millions of vies, likes or even slight feedback. 

Hell, I even bought a website domain this year, still nothing new. Just 3 orders and nothing more. Everyone steps over me like Tiktok and Youtube, and gets all their views and likes, yet I'm the same but no one cares. I only have 1 good video but that's it. I've done everything that youtubers suggest to stand out, even learned in photigraphy but still, not standing out. How the hell do I get out there. 

Even if I've been out there since 2014, no one is giving me feedback when I ask. I just asked a question today onmy personal Facebook but only 1 /400 answered and that's the same on my facebook page, 1/254 care or interact and it'smostly family. I'm not saying I don't care about family but why the hell do I keep trying if no one cares! You can't tell me that no one likes knitting/crochet. I've been out there since 2014 and been everywhere, Pinterest, Etsy, Amazon Handmade, Youtube. Facebook page. NO ONE CARES! 

I am tired of this going no where. I am ready to give up because no one will care or notice anyway. Convince me otherwise. 
This is intense but try being the one living through this.. try being the one who only got 255 likes since 2014. Look, we're in 2020. It's been 6 years. While everyone else around hits 1k or 4k wow thanks for rubbing it in my face! Hell, even my friend got 25 orders for Christmas. Yay for HER. I AM happy for her but I AM also fed up and depressed that nothing better can happen for me.

I even made more production today BUT WHY DO I WASTE MY TIME. Finance has always been a trouble for me and no one is helping, not even family. So what do I do? My arm is hurt and needs recovery too  Concinve me of it (crochet/knitting) not being a waste of time. Convince me! I am very angry and I am trying to stay cool but dude, try this since 2014 and even since 2008. Convince me. That everything is going to be ok and that I'm not doing this for nothing. Convince me that I'll get somewhere. Only 3 items sold since I bought my freaking website. So tell me, what is wrong.

Why does it only get worse?,"I’ve been struggling through my freshman year in college. My mental state was horrible and it had been for months. I’m depressed and I have anxiety and I’m a general mess. So I thought moving back home for a bit would help. And for a while it did. But today I was reminded of how horrible this shit truly is. I’ve been trying to stop my isolating behavior and make plans with people, and I tried to make plans with one of my friends. We had planned to go for a hike today and we had been planning it for a week. It was really the only thing that kept me going through this week and I was so excited for it. I did a lot to prep beforehand and to try to be ready, but as I was getting in my car to get her, she cancels last second. And then later on when I try to text her, she turns it back on me and makes me feel like shit. So now I’m here laying in bed wondering why I even try anything when this type of thing has happened time and time again. My plans with people end up getting cancelled more times than they end up working out. Every time it hurts more than it should, and every time I try to “man up” or hide that I’m upset. But at this point I feel just empty. I feel like life hasn’t worked out for me.

"People say you should talk, but the truth is, no one wants to listen. And stuff.","I have major depression since... i don't know anymore. And anxiety. And who knows what else.

I don't have money to get private help and here in Quebec, public mental health is a big mess. Never been able to see a psycharatrist since i'm not suicidal. I have ALL the other symptoms of depression, but no, i don't need real help, only a social worker (SW) that don't even understand what i'm explaining to them. Tried over 5 antidepressant with wether too much side effects or not helping much (i'm on Cymbalta atm, went up to 120mg, then got down gradually to 60mg and looking forward to stop eventually). Tried pairing with psychostimulants (Ritalin, Concerta, Adderall... Vyvance is too expensive), again, too much side effects. I have MS (my neurologist don't want to get involved and sends me to the SW), my Dad died 5 years ago (and all the friend's help offered magically disappeared 2 weeks later, still not over his death) and plenty of other stuff that would be too long to explain here... I only survive, nothing matters anymore. And now, i have to wait again, because ppl get depressed from the Covid and seasonal, so the services are overcrowded. So i'll keep surviving until it's the good time for me to reach for help again and taken seriously, without being any useful for anyone, not even knowing what i like anymore, ashamed of being unable to get myself out of this shithole alone.

I keep myself alive prob only for my 2 cats, but no, ""get on the list for a SW, maybe in a year you'll get to see one"".

So friends are all like ""you have to talk, you can't keep everyhing inside!"" So i talk. But when it gets too dark, they get embarrassed and don't want to get involved. Or when i turn off their silly advices (yoga, routine, push through my chronic pain, etc) they get mad at me and tell me to stop finding ""excuses"" to not get better. I don't blame them, no one likes negative shit. But gosh i lost friends because i wasn't healthy enough, happy enough, relatable enough for them. Not healing fast enough for them.

So i shut up. I can't trust anyone anymore.

Now i only have my 2 cats, my boyfriend of 9 years, whom has his own problems while trying to help me as much as he can with my MS, so i shut up as much as possible. And his friends; they like me, i like them, but i don't want them to know too much, can't handle this stupid judging drama anymore.

I'm so alone. I wish i was suicidal. Maybe then i would be taken seriously. I don't want to lie and take the place of someone who is a real danger for their own life. I'm stuck. I'm lost. I don't see the end. Medication don't help. SW don't help. What if psy don't help either? What's wrong with me? I'm fighting so hard to keep going. I'm afraid the day i'll be suicidal for real, it'll already be too late. But i'll wait. After winter. After covid. Hoping i'll make it through.

I don't know whether this is depression or just clinginess,"So me and my partner are both in college, and our college is kicking out on campus students after Thanksgiving break.

Why am I like this,"I’ve been doing so well lately. I finally made a decision all on my own for once in my life. I decided that I wanted to be with the girl that loves me unconditionally, and has for 3 years but I thought I needed something more. I’ve been very happy and excited about my decision. My decision that I’ve gone back and forth on for a long time because of my own lack of ability to commit. We got breakfast this morning and she must have been upset about something because she had a bad attitude toward me. She snapped back at me every time I said something so I got mad at her and asked her why she was talking to me that way. She had no reason and didn’t even reply to my question. Then brushed it off like it was nothing. The rest of the time we hung out was awkward. I don’t know what I did or if it was anything I did but now I feel like I’ve been set back. I’ve not been able to stop thinking about how she was snapping at me. I don’t understand why my whole day has to be ruined over something so stupid. Everyone has days where they’re just moody, right? I know I do. So I didn’t say anything else. She doesn’t know that I’ve cried since I got home an hour ago about something that I should be able to just brush off. But I won’t say anything. She has plans with her friends tonight and I have plans with mine. So I’ll hold everything in like I always do.

Every stupid simple task when depressed is a nightmare,"My brain says why on top of not wanting to live do I have to do stupid shit like this, shit that if I don't execute is going to make my life worse, but even if I did execute I'll still be as depressed as if I didn't do the thing? What's the point of struggling if my struggles don't take me anywhere? People study, answer to emails, eat, try to fix their SIM on their phone not working when that happens because they know once those things will get fixed, their life will turn back to normal happy life.

Never-ending rut,"I’m at a new low this week. I feel shame and anxiety because I procrastinated on a task at work and when I needed some new last minutes requests that were impossible to gather by the deadline, my boss got noticeably upset and I just felt shame for being so lazy. Working remotely has had its perks, but I simply cannot focus on anything and getting things done was so much easier when you could just walk up to someone. I’ve lost interest in my job this year, especially since I asked for a raise right before COVID - mind you, I waited a year making shit money in the new role, worked my ass off, earned my stripes, swallowed my anger and said “I’m going to show them that I’m worth more”. I conducted a market analysis, I had documents to prove that my worth was over $10 K higher than my pay at the time, then covid happened. It wasn’t until august that the company found some “normalcy” and was able to get back to that. My raise? Not even 1/3 of my estimated worth. Pocket change. I have been working for that company for eight years and still not breaking 50k. 
“Why don’t you go somewhere else?” You ask, well I have tried. I have submitted dozens of applications this year alone. Only two call backs, one interview, and didn’t get that job because “it’s early in my career”. A masters or certificate would help, but hey you need money to finance those!
I’m tired. I’m so, so tired. I’m tired of wasting time looking for side figs to supplement my income and have some sort of savings going on. I’m tired of being anchored down to a city and people that I’m dying to get away from but can’t seem to land a secure job to leave that behind.

I am on 1% every single day,"I wake up every morning feeling as if a leech has been busy feeding on my soul all night. 

My brain forecasts a terrible day ahead of me before it’s even started, but I already know it’s going to be terrible because of this perpetual, never-ending shit storm that has been swirling around in my mind for 8 years. 

So I lay in bed for a few more hours... until I’m physically able to move. Until I’m just barely able to function. But mentally, I’m still on 1%.

Everything is painful. The simplest of tasks muster every ounce of my strength and will. Every waking minute of my life, I drag this empty shell along to achieve the bare minimum of what it’s expected to do.

I struggle with having ups and downs, I usually have a couple months of being self destructive every year so I struggle to keep jobs. Currently I'm in my fourth job where it's been going really well but now I can feel myself going down again and I'm worried about what will happen, I have two young niece'sthat I would like to be here for but sometimes I'm mixed with if they would be better without me I'm no angel I can promise but I do feel if they weren't born I wouldn't be here now. I've never had a proper relationship and im not really interested in hook ups like other people my age are, I only want a serious relationship. I do feel very alone even though I have friends and family but I always feel like they can't wait for me to shut up so they can just say what they want to talk about and have no interest or genuine care for me. I just don't feel fit for this life and feel I will never meet someone as genuine as myself no matter who that is. I try talk about my problems but I feel too fucked up for anyone to help or non deserving to live, I guess that is life sometimes I don't know. I feel like I will be like that for the rest of my life and should just get used to it but I'm not sure how long I can stand that for. I guess I'm just looking for someone else to say they feel what I'm saying and understand because nobody else I know seems to even want to listen.

I feel it coming on and i can’t stop it,"TL;DR A lot of things in my life have gone wrong recently.  I can feel myself slipping into a deeper depression.  I also know i shouldn’t stay with my boyfriend and don’t want to waste his time but selfishly, he is my source of comfort.

I have struggled on and off with depression since i was about 16.  I am now 22 (F) and i am feeling terrible lately.  Sometimes i do think about ending it all.  I feel pathetic knowing my life is a lot better than most around the world.  But there have just been a lot of things that all happened around the same time that I can’t cope with.  I also don’t have the money to talk to a therapist and it gives me anxiety.  My parents got divorced in January.  They both immediately are in new relationships now which i found unsettling.  I moved away from my only few friends i had in college because I graduated.  I moved in with my mom in March.  Completely isolated (obviously) from the world, i was laid off but things were going ok.  My best friend since 3rd grade and I had a falling out in April (it had been coming), but it is still so hard i’ve never gone so long without talking to her even though i don’t actually want to be her friend anymore.  I am feeling increasingly disconnected and like i have nobody who understands.  I have a BF of 3.5 years who i don’t feel connected to at all.  I don’t know how to breakup with him because i feel so lonely i don’t want to.  But it doesn’t help being with him even though he cares for me deeply.  I just know we aren’t meant to be long term and it haunts me daily thinking i’m wasting his time for my selfish needs.  The thoughts of breaking up with him after losing so much in my life in recent months hurts me.  I don’t want to break his heart either, he wants forever, and doesn’t know to the extent to which i feel this way.  I’m just extremely lost and i just watch youtube all day to cope .  I disgust myself and take the easy way out by numbing with quick domaine release of online procrastination, constantly.  Today i woke up with no energy and i feel pushed down on by my depression.  I have no will to live today.

Why is he pushing me away?,We’ve been on and off for about a year. Every time we’ve ended things it’s because he is going through a depressive episode and can’t maintain a relationship. Then he gets out of the hole and comes back to me. I’ve gotten used to the cycle which I know is bad. I allow him to do this to me and I feel beyond stupid for it. Whenever we’re together he makes me feel so happy and loved then he goes back in a hole and my world crumbles. I’ve noticed that he struggles with mood swings where he’ll be short with me and ignore me then be back to his regular self within a week. He has a lot of friends and doesn’t push them away. I guess I’m curious why me specifically? I always ask him how’s he feeling if he needs anything and he just doesn’t seem to care when he’s going through this.

"Failed veterinary surgeon, no redemption in sight","Hi there, sorry to bother with another sad story/rant/vent, but I just want to get this off my chest.
So, picture this: 28M, East European, graduated vet school in home country about 3 years ago. Good academic performance, worked hard to achieve that. 
I also worked during my studentship as a volunteer for my vet school and for some practice in home town to gain experience. I wanted to learn and do surgery, and I also had plans to get myself involved into regenerative medicine, or... experimental medicine/research. I was pretty motivated to do things. But then, graduation and life struck: 
- the practice that I used to volunteer for, could not hire me, so I had to look elsewhere
- first job in a hospital/emergency clinic, as a new grad; was placed on night duty (a whole week working only nights) from my 2nd week of work. Had a case which I was about to fail if I didn't call for help; decided that emergency was not for me, and I needed to get basic surgical experience; for some reason, the managers and senior doctors tried to negotiate with me to revert my resignation, I went forward with it anyway;
- second job in a general hospital; more sole charge, got to do surgery with little support. managers picking on every mistake like vultures. Then came an offer from an aquaintance to work in a shelter, took it.
- shelter seemed good. was promised loads of surgical time and support, barely any given. then found out that I was brought to repair a huge ""managerial"" mess, but the management sort of gave up on the idea, and I got not too much time, mostly because the managers could ""clean their mess properly"". I worked on medical side, apparently managers were happy with the results. 
- left for UK, as I was told that I could learn things faster in UK, and to a proper standard. Was warned about complaint prone culture and high stress, but I said I would give it a go.
- first job in UK, basically forced to resign, my colleagues didn't like me much, my clients hated me; 2nd job quit because I was tortured into depression by my ""mentor"". 3rd job mostly ok, I was becoming apathetic, as surgical time was non existent; pandemic struck, I was furloughed 4 months, got disconnected from being a doctor, tasted personal freedom, started doing things for my own, on my own, in my rhythm, started doing things I postponed for years 
- unfurloughed, moved to a new region in the same company, work with an indirect aquaintance as my boss. Started doing some mistakes (big) straight away, my boss (which promised to help, and knew of my academic achievements) started to look at me as a failure, and told me she has never seen  a medic so incompetent. I started questioning my entire knowledge and practical abilities. To this day I still do. And from that point, things got bad: I can't seem to think straight, and to take good decisions, I seem to move very slow; every phone ring spikes my anxiety. Every case that at some point seems to go right, immediately deteriorates, and I can't do too much to repair that mistake.  I am afraid of doing surgery. I am afraid, and partially hate doing the job I invested so much into.
I feel like I am trapped and that I have failed badly, as a professional and human being. I am full of guilt and shame for every client disappointed and every case that has not gone well. I feel that the only clean way out is to take the euthanasia drug and have a good dose injected in my vein. If I offer this kind way to address continuous suffering for my patients, why not be kind to myself that way ? I feel there are no other options left in sight, and that, compared withy colleagues, failed at life in general. I moments when I think that I can lift myself up again, but looking at what I have gained (more like lost) so far, I don't think that's possible... I just want the decline to end. I want to be the motivated student that I have been, but hell, I can't stop the train towards misery, nor can I jump out of it...

I think I'm going through a severe serious mental crisis/breakdown. I've been abusing lots of drugs for yesrs. This is an extremely long post and half of it's just me losing my mind and blurting out anything i can think of. I just want to talk to anyone. Life story post below.,"I've been snorting Ritalin every day this week since last Saturday when a friend and I used a lot of MDMA, dexxies and Valium. I'm in a right state and I think I sent myself into a drug induced psychosis for the next couple of days.

This post is extremely long, and I don't expect anybody to read it, nor do I blame rhem. I almost feel like I'm writing in my own diary, but I need to get a monumental amount of shit off my chestI'm going through an insanely rough time and if i even get a single reply, that's enough. I don't usually ever lurk this sub or subscribe to /r/depression, as I'm not sure whether for someone like me, who suffers from perpetual mental illness and constant drug abuse, a sub like this would be good for me, although I think this sub reddit is probably a god send for a lot of people here who feel like nobody understands the struggles of mental illness, and feel like they don't have anyone to talk to about it, and this support group has probably has probably helped a lot of people around the world stay grounded and feel like whatever affliction they're currently experiencing, that they aren't alone, even though it often feels that way, especially when you're constantly trapped inside your head and feel like life is a never ending pit of chronic unhappily and misery. 

Most of you here probably feel like I do, and you yourself have no answer as to why you feel why you do, and even though you don't know why, and probably never will, you will never stop questioning it and everyday you question why you feel this indescribable feeling of sheer emptiness, self loathing, cynicism and cloud of existential dread and eternal misery. I am stubborn in my cynical personality and I do believe I will feel like this for the rest of my life, despite taking the right course of action and seeking help from my doctor and psychiatrist, and doing what I think will help me, but truly I think I've never changed.

I'm still as depressed and fucked in the head as I've ever been, and abusing drugs seems right at the time, and I feel okay for a while, but it's always temporary until I get my hands on another drug to abuse and escape my perpetual misery for a few hours. Drugs have been keeping me going for the better part of a decade now, and besides meth, heroin or alcohol, I'll abuse any drug I can get my hands on to feel anything but sober so I can escape this shitty existence and I feel like I'll continue to be this way if I can get away with it. Recently my long term girlfriend has reached the point of almost leaving me because my drug usage this year has been getting out of control.

I was addicted and a heavy daily weed smoker for about four years until I had a panic attack one night that lasted for several hours that left my body in agony for days following the attack. I kept smoking weed but it was never the same again. Every time after that I tried to smoke weed I'd have a panic attack no matter what. It took dozens of attempts to quit and I eventually got there. I've smoked a few times since then, and haven't had anything close to what I experienced that night, but I can't really enjoy it anymore, and I just became dumber, slower and less motivated and it consumed my life.

I discovered MDMA on new years ever coming into 2020 this year. This became my new drug of choice. The euphoria was unlike anything I'd ever experienced. Instantly I fell in love and I've probably taken MDMA 30-40+ times this year. Proper pure MDMA. I've basically already lost the magic, and have taken up to almost 2g of crystal MDMA in a 24 hour period. At that point your serotonin is completely drained, but I was still high, and had so much MDMA that I was hallucinating from the MDA that your body eventually gets from so much MDMA. The longest break I've taken this year is probably seven weeks away from it.

I buy it from someone who at one point in my life was my best friend. I've known him for around thirteen years now.We grew apart and now he just sells me ecstasy. It's a weird relationship. I feel like there's a weird subconscious acknowledgment that there is simply no friendship there now, and that's fine. I slightly think he's sociopathic, and he seems like a different person to the friend I once knew. I can't read him, and he seems like he has absolutely no moral compass. He doesn't even deal drugs as his full time job. He has his life together, a good paying full time job, a long term girlfriend, who I know he's cheated on about a dozen or more times. He talks about it like it means absolutely nothing and shows zero remorse, regrets or guilt for his actions, or for anything he does for that matter. She found out he cheated on her and she didn't have 100% concrete evidence, and he vehemently denied it, and she stayed with him. She knows deep down that he's cheated on her and fucked multiple other women. I'm unsure why she's stayed with him. He's openly incredibly racist, yet he's an insanely popular person, and people love to be around him, and has a huge social life. He's truly an enigma to me, and I still buy drugs off him. Deep down it took me years to get over the loss of our friendship, as he was my best friend, and after high school, six months went by before he finally decided to reply to my messsges. I already knew the friendship was over but I didn't want to believe it at the time. I truly grieved as if a family member had died. We text each other sometimes these days, non drug related conversations, and ""we'll hang out soon, we'll make it happen"". I know it won't happen. I'm a client to him, nothing more. It's a business exchange for product he's selling. It's weird though because whenever we talk in person he talks to me like nothing has changed, and our conversations almost feel like those that we had when we were close friends, except we're not anymore. It feels weird that he's so nice to me socially when we talk when I'm buying drugs off him, as if we were still best friends. The kind of conversations that feel like they could last for hours and hours, and everything flows so naturally, except the conversations only last a few minutes now. I often ponder what goes through his head. I can't tell whether he's a sociopath or just incredibly morally bankrupt. It surprises me knowing all this about him, yet he's a very well liked person, an ""alpha"" type male and yet everything about him has red flags everywhere. I know that other people know what he's like, but none of his current friends seem to care about how awful of a person he is. I'm constantly puzzled by it. I sometimes wonder if he's empty inside and he comes across as a bit of a thrill seeker who's always looking for something exciting and dangerous. He seems to live his life that way. He parties a lot, drinks heavily and does cocaine and occasionally uses MDMA himself, but he's not using it to the extent I am. He's seemingly able to abstain from all substances, and as far as I'm aware he's never actually been addicted to any particular drug, and appears to be able to just not use anything for long periods of time, unless he's having a huge bender. I'm surprised that he's never been addicted to any drug, and I don't know how he seeks so stable, being able to have a successful job, sell drugs, buy a house with his girlfriend and maitain such a reckless intense lifestyle. I sometimes feel like he's an unstoppable machine, and his family see none of this side of him, except maybe him being drunk I guess, as alcohol is legal and socially acceptable. 

2019/2020 have been the two lowest worst years in recent memory.  The place where I was working full time shut down so I was transferred to another store. I worked in the back of a retail store in the warehouse with one other guy. He was unhinged and made my working life very difficult. I think his divorce fucked him up permanently and his life was falling apart. He'd constantly call in sick, go on 1.5 hour lunch breaks to go home and get stoned, had a huge chip on his shoulder and was just not a good person to work alongside every day of the week. He'd constantly throw huge tantrums that the whole before could see/hear. I was constantly under pressure to do the work of two people. He was eventually fired. His replacement was even worse. He called in sick for almost six months on and off and I think I worked with him for a total of maybe six weeks. I was losing the plot, and my managers didn't give a fuck because I somehow manager to keep thing's afloat, despite being the only person in the warehousing for almost two years. I met my current girlfriend there and we were luckily both moved to the same store. My old store was five minutes from home. The new one was 30-40 minutes from home. I used to fill my car up once a fortnight. I now had to get petrol twice a week. Life got more expensive. I was incredibly anxious starting at another store with about 30 people I'd never met. 

Life got even worse. Once again, I was working alongside one other full-time person who was the head of the warehouse. A woman this time. She hated me from the very first day I started. She was currently going through a divorce, and my theory is she decided to take it out on me, although despite that, she was a genuinely psychotic individual who eventually lead to me resigning. Everything I did was wrong in her eyes. She didn't want to work alongside me as a team. She wanted to control me and mould me. She hated that I was taught how to do the job differently by somebody else. She made me sign ""company"" policies that weren't actually official policies, which I called her out on, so she would make threats of getting the managers to write me up on official warnings. She was spreading malicious lies about the store administered to me which I foolishly and naively believed and made me believe she was an awful person, and said I'd get in trouble if I didn't do things the way the admin was directing us to. At the time I had no reason to doubt her, in hindsight I felt fucking awful and guilty and eventually the admin and I figured out she was playing sick mind games pitting us against each other. I still feel guilty to this day because she made me hate her, even after apologising to her for believing her sick twisted lies.

She would constantly make threats of checking security footage to make sure rules were being followed and would often say she was going to the managers to get me into trouble if she found out I'd fucked up or made a mistake. She would intentionally write my name on pieces of work so managers would walk past and see it and question me on it. She would do the same if I was dealing with customer issues on our work computers which managers would constantly inquire about. There was no team work. If you started something, you finished it, even if you were off for two days on your weekend, she would refuse to help or even touch anything I'd started, because she didn't want to get herself involved in anything that could ever potentially leave a paper trail with her name on it. This meant that work wasn't getting completed at the rate it should. The job is literally team orientated and requires communication and cooperation to get the job done efficiently. 

The warehouse was absolute chaos and nothing made sense. To give context, it was tech retail. When I first started there, desktop computer monitors were randomly placed in five different aisles. I always tried to maintain a clean warehouse and tried to make sure every product (TV, fridge, computer etc) were all in designated areas, organised by brand and price. My first course of action was to condense all of the computer monitors into a single aisle out on display in racks on the shop floor to make it easier for the sales people. She lost her mind and demanded I bring them all back into the warehouse.

We had expensive laptops in the warehouse, and budget laptops at the front of the store on racks that required a ladder to get to which was in the busiest section of the store. It made no sense to have them in two different places. I brought all the budget laptops out to the warehouse and condensed and reorganised everything by brand, price and whether it was a gaming laptop, surface, or ultra book. She went straight to the managers to complain that I was ruining the warehouse and messing everything up. 

Truck drivers were constantly arriving to deliver stock, so they would press a button which would buzz to indicate we had deliveries. Often times I'd be down the back of the other end of the warehouse dealing with large TVs or fridges etc. She was constantly sitting at the computer wasting time making ""phone calls"" ""chasing things up"" and would ignore the truck drivers or blatantly get off her computer chair and conveniently walk off while I was in the middle of other work. I forever felt like I wasn't getting any work done. The work was literally piling up and our invoices were always behind schedules and I was constantly being questioned why I wasn't getting the work done by the managers. Every single day we could potentially receive 300-400 cartons of stock which had to be counted, and signed for before receiving to make sure we weren't missing anything. One truck alone could have 100 cartons of stock. Each individual carton had to be unopened, and could contain a dozen cameras, four drones, or fifty toasters tons single invoice, and all had to be individually priced and correctly tagged with the right product number. This was mostly left to me to do all of the stock processing because she was always ""too busy' on the computer wasting time and sucking up to the manager about how she'd ""fixed a customer issue"".

She would also legitimately sit in the office for 1-2 hours several days of the week going through security footage to find timelines of store theft. This was not a requirement of our job, and I would be left in the warehouse alone trying to get through hundreds of boxes of products, invoices and price them all up, all while dealing with truck drivers, customer calls, customer repairs, sending out online orders, taking customer orders to the counter and helping customers put TVs in their car. My store manager defender her using the security cameras to look for store theft as ""she is the head of stock, so it's her job to manage theft"" despite the fact that we literally had shopping centre police officers who dealt with thieves and it was their responsibility to grab security footage and try and arrest them. 

She would constantly tell every truck driver I was useless and that she was always trying to fix up mistakes. I'm entirely convinced she was literally making the job more complicated than it was to make her look like she'd done a lot of work, when in reality she was just wasting time and leaving me to fend for myself.

She would go on paid holiday leave, come back after her holidays and instead of a ""hey I'm back from my holiday"" it was ""the invoice list is fucking disgraceful"". Literally the first thing she said as she started back. This was around Christmas time when we had 3x the stock coming in so I couldn't keep up on my own and the warehouse was falling apart, customer repairs weren't getting sent out on time, stock wasn't getting put out fast enough, and I was always to blame. The only time she while process new stock was when the managers would receive emails from companies questioning why stock that came in a month ago hadn't been invoiced and paid. 

I'd had about half a dozen meetings with all three managers expressing my complaints, to the point where I really started to lose my cool and flew off the handle and started yelling and raging about how I was being treated. This was constantly swept under the rug. I was losing my mind. I ended up taking a week of stress leave. I was so close to snapping and I had to go home immediately one afternoon before I exploded in a fit of rage.

I worked with about 30-40 people. Everybody could see how bad it was, to the point that a couple of other staff expressed their concerns but nothing changed. She started to really get into my head, and I started doubting myself and was questioning if I was really bad at my job. She was winning and I knew it. I was losing my sanity and I'd go home everyday in a fit of rage and anger and my girlfriend essentially said ""if you don't resign, nothing will change and you're just going to get worse, you need to seek psychiatric help"". 

I'd been considering it for months, but it was a stable full time job, I was well liked, and the pay was decent. My whole life was this job and I made a lot of good friends there, despite this woman. I didn't want to leave but I was losing my sanity and I thought I was going crazy and she beat me. I ended up resigning before I had a full blown break down. 

Here's the icing on the cake no pun intended. All of my coworker got me a cake to say goodbye. Everybody knew why I was leaving. The psychotic cunt took a piece of my going away cake after her shift and fucked off without a word. I was truly disgusted at that point. It actually ruined what was already a shit day and she found away to make it worse. Fuck her. I'm still incredibly bitter and she legitimately fucked me up so bad mentally.

I was unemployed for several months, I lost my entire identity, and I hit rock bottom. I'm surprised my girlfriend is still with me. I was at home for several months unemployed, depressed, abusing drugs everyday and trying to keep myself from doing anything stupid.

I have a new full time job at another warehouse. A different company. I only work with around six people now. It's just as bad and I'm spiralling worse than ever. One of them is an ex meth head who's admitted he's an alcoholic currently, but apparently hates and judges whenever I've discussed MDMA use, another is obsessed with violence and gets into drunk fights on weekends, another is a 30 year old man child who sulks most of the day, and is a huge weeaboo who randomly says Japanese words mixed in with normal worse and constantly aays everything is ""cringe"", another is a mid 40s hardcore conspiracy theorist who thinks covid19 is fake, 5G is a weaopon, fluorine is bad and bill gates is giving kids autism. When I disagreed with him he verbally abused me and literally lost his mind at me and called me a ""cunt"" and a ""faggot cunt"" about 20-30 times.

Fuck me right? 

I'm thinking of buying some drug's today. I'm home alone all day and all I want to do is get fucked up and jerk off to porn like the sad fucked up cunt that I am. Nobody will read this essay of fucking shit anyway. I've been writing this for almost three hours and it's almost 5:00AM. I need to sleep. Hope you're all existing. That's all it is to me now. I can already hear the magpies warbling and the sun is rising. If there is one thing I do truly love in life it's birds. I have three pet budgies. They're beautiful happy little creatures. They'll probably be awake now too. At least they'll keep me company today.",GuyIncognitos,3,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jygbra/i_think_im_going_through_a_severe_serious_mental/,snorting ritalin every day week since

I feel heart broken.,"Last night, I made the decision to finally break off my 6 year relationship. 

I love him dearly as human, but I’m no longer in love with him. 

I was paying the rent and electric bill on my own, while he constantly changed jobs and quit them. 

We no longer slept in bed together. 

The affection slowly started to dwindle, besides occasional sex, which still wasn’t as often as I had wanted. 

I feel so lost, not over me. I could care less. But I hurt him and it’s ripping me into.

Distant friend reached for help. Need advice helping this man,"Hi everyone. Yesterday, a friend from my college days reached out for help. We’re not close but he seems desperate to get some help. I listened to him over the phone for an hour and got a general idea of what is happening and what i might need to do.

I wanted to get some advice on how to find the right therapist. I also want to know how I can better help this friend.

Heres what i have gathered
- he claims he is depressed
- he is extremely paranoid
- he fears his parents are controlling him
- he seems to have difficulty reasoning his fears
- he says “when i go outside the buildings start waving at me” hallucinating? i think he is aware that these are not really happening
- he has met 5-6 different therapists but only found 1 good fit. but doesnt “trust” the therapist. be believes somehow his parents have made contact with the therapist and is controlling the therapist.

he says he would really benefit from therapist that ‘gets’ him.
- must speak mandarin 
- must understand chinese culture
- lady? in her 50’s
- must have no connection to his parents

I am just as confused as some of you folks reading this post. but my friend seems like he is in a really deep shit and I want to do my part and help out as much as i can.

If you know any therapist who fits the prerequisites, please DM me with a way to contact them.

What more questions can I ask my friend to better help him?

I feel tired all the time even if i do nothing,"Ive been feeling this way for a while, i have no goals (at least not within my reach), no motivation at all, all the things i do i do it to past the time. Maybe i have some fun hanging out with ""friends"", playing games or watching netflix, but it just a moment, later i feel empty again.

No one ive talked to could help me (i understand this), but meanwhile my parents blame me all the time for leading this life and i have no clue to what should i do. I kinda understand them, im young and full of possibilities but i do not have the energy or the desire to start anything and they dont understand me, so this just make the things worse.

Sometimes I have suicidal thoughts, nothing ties me to life yet, but i guess like most of the people what prevents me from doing so is the people i love and love me.

So i just trapped in life i guess, or at least thats how i feel.

Is this depression? Should i treat this in therapy? (I mean the most ""serious"" one, i went to three psychologists in my life, i feel like none have helped) most of my life i felt ""on the edge of depression"", but maybe i always had it.

Should I consult a doctor?,"Idk if it’s a place for it. Please tell me quickly if not.
So these days i feel empty. It’s not like I always crying or I’m sad or anything like that. But I just don’t feel anything good, I don’t know know to describe it. Sometimes I realize that I spend several minutes up in from of a mirror or, lying on my bed doing nothing and it makes me feel bad. I feel guilty that I haven’t done anything, but at the same time I don’t have any kind of motivation or even energy to do it. But at the same time i don’t move and I don’t want to. It’s so sick because time flies so fast since I act this way. Even tho if I do something by chance it doesn’t satisfy me and I can’t really concentrate myself on doing it. So I stop any kind of activity just after I start. I’m irritated way more easily and the only thing I really try to do is to hide myself from people even tho I don’t really realize that at the moment. 
I don’t know what I want to do, I certainly don’t want to go to work since it’s the activity that makes me frustrated and empty way more than anything else. I really hate this place and people that I work with. It makes me sick and my only aim every week is to find another excuse to not to go there. 
Even school pisses me off because I can’t focus and be as enthusiastic as always. I used to love school and what I learn but now even school is frustrating and makes me wanna cry a bit.
Is it normal? Should I go to the doctor?
Please I need help I can’t do that. I don’t act like usually. It’s not me. What should I do?

"I'm going to die, soon. Very soon.","I don't know if I am going to write a suicide note or just explain what I'm gonna do. Well, I can't stand to live anymore. I've been severely depressed for the past seven years. Psychologist didn't help me at all. Reaching out just gets forgotten about. I've just finished school and have no idea what the fuck I'm gonna do. These past couple days I've been getting major panic attacks where I can't breathe and I start tearing up. Sometimes I just want to smash every single thing in my room and punch holes in my walls and crash my car. I don't want to live through the consequences. When I'm driving to work I zone out and picture scenarios where I swerve off the bends and go tumbling down the cliff to my death. 

Nothing brings me comfort anymore, not even music. I've never had a girlfriend, never had sex, never had somebody love me back, I've never been truly happy for more than a day. There was a girl who I thought I might have had a chance with, but my best friend got drunk and started talking to her when he knew I was into her, taking all her attention away from me. I know I shouldn't be dwelling on it but I just am and I can't help it. She was the only person to let me know that she is there for me and is only a phone call away. Maybe I'm overthinking it or some other dogshit.... I overthink everything to the point where I make myself feel nauseous. So....I don't know when I will do this but I have a plan; I'm going to purchase a large bottle of alcohol (something strong), get blackout drunk alone, and walk out into the sea. Drown myself while blacked out. Fall asleep underwater. Un-exist. I will stop screwing up all opportunities. I will cease to fuck up my life and embarrass myself anymore. I will do everyone a favour, I know a lot of people dislike me. I will never know what it will be like to be an adult. I'll never know what true love will be like. I'll never know what life success will be like. I'll never be truly happy ever. But the fact that I will not feel this way anymore outweighs all of those points. I literally have zero reasons to stay alive. And I mean that, not like an exaggeration but seriously. I can't think of any reason to stay alive EXCEPT for the fact that I will bring sadness to my immediate family. But I will be forgotten about within the next few years, as all suicides are. Maybe I'll be remembered by someone in a few decades and they'll think ""wow, I remember him. I wonder what he would've made of himself if he hadn't committed suicide all those years ago."" And then I will be forgotten about one more time, for eternity. We are just a bunch of cruel, judgemental apes on a wet rock cruising through an empty blanket of nothingness, so my death will not be anything important. I won't make a difference to this sad pathetic world. Anyway, I'm rambling. Goodbye.

"I finally had found motivation for future plans, but now I feel like a failure for not being able to do a certain thing","I am still in high school. In my country you have different levels of education, and since I do the highest, people expect me to go to University. However, recently I got really inspired by my music teacher. I feel like I would enjoy doing that. The study for becoming a music teacher is a not on university level, but one below that. In my country that is still very good, but I feel like people have big expectations and I can’t choose.

Even because all of this, I still had a lot of motivation to go for this. Last week in the music lesson, we had to do a hearing exercise and ty and recognise intervals. Other people seemed to be really good at it, but I just can’t do it. Been trying for over a week, and it feels like I’m not advancing at all.

All of this has crushed my spirit. I was finally hopeful again, but I can’t seem to find any motivation for anything.

I'm 28 and failure.,"I don't want any advices, it makes no difference. I just want to pour my heart out.

&amp;#x200B;

When I was younger, I was considered one of the best students but it was just a fasade, I was an imposter,  my knowledge was never  complete, it  never had any value. I got degree in medicine -MD medical doctor. but I was studying on last day before the exams just to pass, with lowest points possible.  I was busy with being depressed and wasting time. I was emotionally overwhelmed, creating dramas from my life, feeling distressed by failed relationhips and  in dread of the my future and my career, but never doing anything to achieve something. After finishing Uni my friend helped me and I got high payed job. I learned things but because of being lazy I never mastered anything.  I didn't make necessary efforts to learn or gain experience. But still at my work I'm considered as  a good employee, but it's still a fasade. This is a fact, not the result of my ill consciousness.

I thought I could speak English fluently ( I'm from a poor country of eastern Europe), but it's also and illusion, my knowledge is shallow.

I'm 28 now, I'm about too lose job I had for 6 years.. I have no talents, I have no skills, so is my husband, he lost his job over the month ago. but even while he was working I was the main provider for our little family. I was paying for rent, buying groceries, giving him money after he spent all his salary.

For my whole life I've been an outcast, fighting depression and being lazy. I have only one wish.. I want to sleep and never wake up. I'm not suicidal, just I don't want to live my life is poverty and misery. I don't know how to change it and I'm sure it's the way my life is gonna end up. If you create no value you are useless.

Worried about my girlfriend,"I want to try and make this fairly anonymous sounding without leaving out any vital information. I just need some help or advice.

My (20m) girlfriend (18f) has depression, and has had a few depressive episodes since we started dating in January. I’ve tried to give support, and she told me today that during those episodes, she felt as bad as she does currently, I’m not sure what I did differently back then in terms of support.

This episode has been since September, and it’s only getting worse. She is extremely suicidal, today was only talking about the ways she wanted to die, and was saying she is trying to kill her self indirectly (walking into traffic etc). 

The problem is, her family don’t know about me. Her friends do, but they don’t know about her suicidal thoughts so I can’t turn to them, it’d be fairly invasive if I did (right?). And we live on opposite sides of the world. I am quite literally helpless. She is getting quite angry when I talk about therapy and seeking outside help etc. 

(Also just some extra information, my cousin also attempted suicide a few nights ago, has been in hospital ever since. Plus because of gf’s depression, she’s been really crossing some lines and saying hurtful things to me, so I feel fairly upset, not holding anything against her but still just feeling worn out. I don’t feel I can help her on my own because of all of this.)

This is such a helpless situation and I have no idea at all how to get past it. If anyone has advice or help or just... anything. Please.

Life is so hard feeling confused,Im a aware there’s humans out there that have it worse than me. I just have this sadness I’m angry at myself for being introvert and shy. I feel that that’s been holding me back to be a productive human being . I’m in a relationship and my BF and I are both 20 years old been together for almost a year. I really like him but sometimes I feel like I’m not the one for him because I have my own problems that’s preventing me from living life. I wanna break up with him because I feel like if I continue I’m going to wear him off and waste his time. I just wanna be alone since I have no friends to begin with mind as well be alone. Now in terms of career I only have my high school diploma and have a job that pays above the minimum wage. I’ve attempted to go to college two times but fail because I either can’t pay or I have no motivation to continue because I find some excuse that I end up not liking it.

I just realized I have no goals in life,"**Backstory, can be skipped:**

Looking back as long as I can remember I was always depressed, sometimes more or less, with suicidal thoughts mixed in (which I never followed through, typical ""mom would be sad"" situation). Most things that I did were always because they were expected from me. And I did them well enough, I've never seriously failed at anything as far as I remember (school, jobs, university, new jobs, ..).

I did crack once under the pressure of my Bachelor's thesis, came out to my mom as depressed and went to a therapist (I had to, that was quite the close call). There I got anti-depressants (two kinds as the first didn't work so well). All that did was make me feel even less, no longer suicidal, but just empty. And I couldn't even get up to finish my thesis.

A few weeks later I stopped taking them, got some motivation back and powered through. Finished it, passed, finished university and off to work I went. A bit more content, sometimes even happy for a few days at a time. That was years ago, soon I'm going to be 30..

**Actual topic:**

As probably everyone I sometimes like to imagine to suddenly be rich. What would I do then? Quit my job, get a house and a nice car, play videogames all day, read more books, .. the usual things. But today no matter how hard I thought about it I couldn't think of a single thing I really would want to do. Not one.

Then my view suddenly shifted: What are things right now in my current situation which I can't do because I don't have the time or money for it? Anything?

And again I drew a blank.

I can't think of a single thing I want to do, or any goal that I have. Sure, with more freetime I'd spend more time gaming, watching movies and reading books, but that doesn't make one really happy (As I found out, had a full month off at the beginning of the pandemic and did absolutely nothing).

Compared to phases in my life back then I'm in a better place. Not sad or suicidal, but at the same time I feel empty and don't know what to do about it. Obviously I still do what's expected of me (mostly go to work), but that's it. When nobody expects anything from me (like on the weekend) I just lie around, eat too much and let the time pass.

"I just haven’t got a clue what I’m doing or what I even want to do with my life. I’m totally empty on the inside, honestly.","I wish I had a talent or some ambition to do something.

No relations with women whatsoever.

Chronic Indecision and Overthinking,"I don't know if it has to do with my ADD, Anxiety, or both but I have extremely severe issues related to making decisions, even very small ones. I overthink every single thing all day and I'm also a perfectionist to the point of it possibly being OCD. All of it started about 5 years ago and has been getting progressively worse every year. I have some other mental health issues but the things I described above are what bother me the most.

I'm at the point where I can't function at all. I've given up on even trying to make small decisions throughout the day because I will often spent 10+ hours on a decision that should take a few minutes at most. I have this urge that things need to ""feel right"" and if they don't I am never satisfied with a decision I've made. It's hard to describe just how bad the indecision actually is. For example I've spent the last 4 months trying to decide if I should use subtitles when watching TV/Movies or playing video games. I keep going back and forth and it's completely ruined my ability to enjoy those activities. No matter what choice I make it ""feels"" like the wrong one. I feel like I'm drowning and I don't know what to do. Should I seek therapy?

What should I do,There was this girl I really liked who broke up with me about a month ago. With recent recent Covid restrictions being put on my area and university becoming more intense I have been under a lot of stress lately and have been very sad. I don’t know what to do because the one friend I usually talk to you about this stuff is giving me very bad advice and it usually makes the situation worse. I want to get back with this girl but I understand I have to fix somethings before I have that opportunity and even if I do there’s still the chance we do not get back together. On top of that she went on a long vacation about three months ago and and won’t be coming back for for at least another three months (she might visit at Christmas time). I need someone to talk to you and I’m planning on calling the girls friend. Her friend and I were close until the break up. Would I be better off meditating and relaxing today or calling her friend and explaining what’s going on.

I know I'm kind of depressed and I don't want to overcome it. It is killing me,"I know I'm kind of depressed and I don't want to overcome it. My family doesn't know this or even the fact that I used to self harm. I stopped cutting myself but sometimes I just miss it. I bang my head or hit myself to cause pain. I think the pain inside can only be felt if I hurt myself on outside. I get so irritated and frustrated. People think I'm good because I talk to them laughing and smiling. It is not I always feel sad but I know I haven't felt alive since years. I texted the love of my life that he should consider me dead. We had to break up due to the circumstances and now he hates me because he feels guilty because of me and this is because of his own overthinking. I am so filled up to brim with all these things slowly killing me deep with a knife such that I can feel it.
I don't want to talk to my friends but have to because of the work and all. I just want to be alone but I also need a big long hug from the loml so that we both feel okay.

This depression thing is a lot harder on my heart than my mind,"I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about all my problems.. I'm only getting 3 hours of sleep. I still feel really sad and I don't have motivation to do anything.. stress from work adds to my anxiety. I hate people.. I tell myself I love my job but I don't. I'm still mourning my breakup and it's been over a year. It was the most traumatic way for things to end. I'm just not finding any reason to be around. I feel like I'm just living until it's time to go. I haven't cried so hard since my breakup. Not even the Disney movie Up can make me cry anymore. It breaks my heart to leave my family knowing that I won't experience any more memories with them if I do go. I'm tired of seeing people who have actually done wrong and bad things in this world, get what they want. And for me, who has tried so hard and invested so much, get a knife right through my heart from the one person who I gave my all to, just leave me like I'm nothing. Like I don't exist. I'm just a broken person.. I'm trying to be happy. I really am. But then this sadness happens put of nowhere and I can't block it out. I can't focus. I already tried seeking help and I don't feel like medication is the answer. I've already told my story over and over again but no one understands to know what I went through. The pain I endured to make things work. How unhappy I was to sacrifice my life for someone who wasn't giving me the bare minimum. Even though I communicated everything, I feel so stupid for wasting my time. I don't think anyone will love me the right way how I want to be loved. That's my fear. And that I won't find someone who will understand me. I read all these stories of how people have made adjustments in their lives for their SO and I'm still struggling wondering why mine didn't... I'm just deeply sad.. I had to get out those current thoughts... I've never experienced depression this bad. But then again this has been building up ever since childhood.

My mother has Covid as well as pneumonia. I’m far from family and friends.,"My mother (56) has had Covid for about a week. She’s been in a lot pain and she’s now in the hospital with pneumonia as well. She’s been in for two days now, not getting any better however not getting any worse. I live on the other side of the country and I want to be closer to her. My family doesn’t want me traveling because I am high risk as well. I understand that but feel hopeless so far away from my loved ones. 

My mother is a strong woman who lives a pretty healthy lifestyle. She takes care of her horses, gets in her garden, and chases around two of her grandchildren (1 and 3) around her house. I have faith in her however, I’ve never seen her this Sick before in my entire life. It scares me a lot, I have been able to get more than a couple hours of sleep a night I’m so worried. 

My depression has been building all year. I moved to the Rockies from my hometown in Florida at the beginning of the year. It’s been tough without all my family and friends out here during this pandemic. Now my mother is sick and I wanna be around people I love but can’t.

Nothing is working,"I recently decided to do something about my depression so I went to therapy, got prescribed antidepressants, started working out for endorphins. And surprise surprise ! It's been a few months and there's literally no change in anything. I don't feel better after therapy, I was already skeptical but this just proves that therapy is useless to some people. I already know what's wrong with me, I already know what I SHOULD be doing, i6already know I should try to be more positive and surround myself with a good support system but it's kinda difficult to do any of that when I have trouble getting out of bed or finding meaning in anything. Talking about it for an hour every week won't help. Don't know why I expected this scam to work but whatever. 

Then we move on to meds, I really did have high hopes, it's science, it has to work ! It didn't. I have been taking wellbutrin and zoloft, I don't feel any different, if anything they make everything worse because they have their own shitty side effects. 

Then exercising. All the rage ! Again, had high hopes, it's just chemistry, you exercise ur brain releases endorphins and u feel less shitty about yourself for a few hours! I'd have been ok with a few hours, or just 10 minutes of calmness not even happiness but....nothing. idk if my brain doesn't release them or what but umm there's nothing happening I just feel sore.

Obviously I didn't expect any of these to make me happy or cure me or work overnight but after months I expected SOME kind of progress. Just a sign that I'm not gonna be like this for the rest of my miserable life until I finally grow some balls and kill myself one day...but nothing..

A Day In My Life,"Depression is making plans with friends tomorrow because you promised yourself that you have to go out more in order to feel better. 

Depression is regretting making those plans at 4am the day of, wondering if they would understand if you explained. But you know they won't.

Depression is leaving your room and heading out after hours of trying to sleep.

Depression is the random urge you feel to take a leap forward when you're waiting at the stoplight. But you know you can't.

Depression is stopping by a 7-11 and buying a chocolate bar and a drink, although you know you shouldn't. You've been working out and eating healthy all week to feel better about yourself. But you do it anyways because maybe, just maybe, it'll make you feel better. But it doesn't.

Depression is looking at all the notifications and texts you have on your phone, but feeling empty inside. You want to tell them how depressed, tired, and sad you are right now, but you know they wouldn't know how to respond and it would just make them uncomfortable. It's realizing that you literally have no one you can open up to.

Depression is wondering how many days are left until the next therapy session, and wishing it would happen more than once a week because you're desperate to be healed. You don't want to feel broken anymore. You miss the old you that people still see when they look at you. 

Depression is going to sleep as the sun rises, but setting 20 alarms so that you will be forced to wake up.

Depression is spending what feels like hours to get up, and then rushing out the door because you'll be late. 

Depression is smiling when you see your friends and making them laugh. It makes you feel good. At least that's what you tell yourself.

Depression is covering your face with a peace symbol whenever you see the camera pointed at you because you're insecure but don't want people to know.

Depression is making jokes about killing yourself because it's funny.

Depression is realizing that you actually had a great time, and maybe you're not depressed. You feel a little fake and bad for those who actually can't get out of bed.

Depression is arriving home and realizing that you weren't faking it. 

Depression is really wanting to kill yourself although you just had a fun day with your friends. 

Depression is posting this on reddit, hoping that someone you know will see this and realize I'm struggling.

Depression is wanting to be cared for and understood.

Help?,"Hi, I'm kind of desperate for help and I guess I'm hoping that someone will be able to give me some advice or understanding. A few things about me: my childhood has been pretty traumatic. It's very complicated so I'll sum it up with mental and physical abuse from my family and other people I've cared about and trusted. It hasn't always their intention to hurt me and I know I'm loved but intentions and love don't really matter because it still has hurt me very deeply. I've been trying to deal with it but there's always something new that happens, I can never get a fucking break from life and it has been like that almost my whole life.

Some other things that might be relevant is that I've been dealing with anxiety my whole life, I had my first panic attack when I was 3 or 4, I've been sexually assaulted too many times to count. I was 2 or 3 the first time and now I hate my body, especially everything that can be viewed as ""sexy"". 

I have been to numerous therapists and all that but it just doesn't help. I have tried everything they've told me to do, exercise, eat clean, get fresh air, sleep... You probably know what I'm talking about. Nothing helps, and yes I've done it long term not just a day or two. It never gets better, just worse. Sure sometimes it has been easier but we're talking about a month tops. This has literally been my whole life and it has just gotten worse over the years. I have been suicidal on and off since I was 10, I'm 18 now. I failed at killing myself a few weeks ago and I went to the hospital with an ambulance. My current therapist got the news but when we talked about it she just kept misunderstanding me or brushing things off. She does not understand me and no one ever fucking does. I'm so frustrated and I don't know what to do. All I ever get is pity, misunderstanding or dumb advice that doesn't work for me. I want to get better but at the same time I see no reason to, life sucks. It always has and it always will. My future consists of going to school, working, retiring and dying if I even make it that long. Some short moments of happiness in exchange for a lifetime of suffering. I do not see the point.

I have friends, I know I'm loved, I know that I'd hurt a lot of people very deeply if I kill myself but I can't keep going like this forever and nothing I've tried has been working long term. I really don't want to hurt anyone but I'm out of options at this point, my mental illnesses physically hurt, I have no motivation or energy to do anything. Everything gives me anxiety or requires a lot of energy and determination to do, drinking water, eating, even just going to the fucking toilet to pee. If anyone has read this far I'm sorry for the confusing ass text. I don't know why I'm writing this, I guess there is a small part of me that wants to feel better and live instead of just ending everything but I don't know how and I feel like I've tried everything at this point.",sadpotato27,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jydkf3/help/,hi kind desperate help guess hoping someone able give advice understanding thing childhood ha pretty traumatic complicated sum mental physical abuse family people cared trusted always intention hurt know loved intention love really matter still ha hurt deeply trying deal always something new happens never get fucking break life ha like almost whole life thing might relevant dealing anxiety whole life first panic attack wa 3 4 sexually assaulted many time count wa 2 3 first time hate body especially everything viewed sexy numerous therapist help tried everything told exercise eat clean get fresh air sleep probably know talking nothing help yes done long term day two never get better worse sure sometimes ha easier talking month top ha literally whole life ha gotten worse year suicidal since wa 10 18 failed killing week ago went hospital ambulance current therapist got news talked kept misunderstanding brushing thing doe understand one ever fucking doe frustrated know ever get pity misunderstanding dumb advice work want get better time see reason life suck always ha always future consists going school working retiring dying even make long short moment happiness exchange lifetime suffering see point friend know loved know hurt lot people deeply kill keep going like forever nothing tried ha working long term really want hurt anyone option point mental illness physically hurt motivation energy anything everything give anxiety requires lot energy determination drinking water eating even going fucking toilet pee anyone ha read far sorry confusing text know writing guess small part want feel better live instead ending everything know feel like tried everything point,help,sad potato 27,2947,5,sad potato 27 hi kind desperate help guess hoping someone able give advice understanding thing childhood ha pretty traumatic complicated sum mental physical abuse family people cared trusted always intention hurt know loved intention love really matter still ha hurt deeply trying deal always something new happens never get fucking break life ha like almost whole life thing might relevant dealing anxiety whole life first panic attack wa 3 4 sexually assaulted many time count wa 2 3 first time hate body especially everything viewed sexy numerous therapist help tried everything told exercise eat clean get fresh air sleep probably know talking nothing help yes done long term day two never get better worse sure sometimes ha easier talking month top ha literally whole life ha gotten worse year suicidal since wa 10 18 failed killing week ago went hospital ambulance current therapist got news talked kept misunderstanding brushing thing doe understand one ever fucking doe frustrated know ever get pity misunderstanding dumb advice work want get better time see reason life suck always ha always future consists going school working retiring dying even make long short moment happiness exchange lifetime suffering see point friend know loved know hurt lot people deeply kill keep going like forever nothing tried ha working long term really want hurt anyone option point mental illness physically hurt motivation energy anything everything give anxiety requires lot energy determination drinking water eating even going fucking toilet pee anyone ha read far sorry confusing text know writing guess small part want feel better live instead ending everything know feel like tried everything point help
i feel fucking horrible,"Why is it that when I feel fine and okay, I can suddenly fixate on one bad moment from my past that probably wasnt that big of a deal and not move on. Or I can have the rest of my day ruined by one less than positive comment or action online or irl.

I feel like my life is always a waiting game to see when I snap, when I hold in my personality and my sensitivity in until it explodes and I start yelling or wanting to die. Why can't I be a normal person and move on and not hold a grudge or need an apology.

Might be because I generally don't tell anyone what I'm feeling and so when something does happen, I hold on to it and think about it constantly, I'm not sure. Maybe that's an excuse for my shitty victimhood if I do have it, it's like you don't want to believe you're that sensitive but maybe you are, and you're a dumbass for not realizing it sooner.",throwaway384947483,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy9t0i/i_feel_fucking_horrible/,feel fine okay suddenly fixate one bad moment past probably wasnt big deal move rest day ruined one le positive comment action online irl feel like life always waiting game see snap hold personality sensitivity explodes start yelling wanting die normal person move hold grudge need apology might generally tell anyone feeling something doe happen hold think constantly sure maybe excuse shitty victimhood like want believe sensitive maybe dumbass realizing sooner,feel fucking horrible,throwaway 384947483,862,23,throwaway 384947483 feel fine okay suddenly fixate one bad moment past probably wasnt big deal move rest day ruined one le positive comment action online irl feel like life always waiting game see snap hold personality sensitivity explodes start yelling wanting die normal person move hold grudge need apology might generally tell anyone feeling something doe happen hold think constantly sure maybe excuse shitty victimhood like want believe sensitive maybe dumbass realizing sooner feel fucking horrible

A message I was going to send my friend,"I’m always the last one awake and honestly I love it because it gives me so much time to reflect on my failures and how much I hate myself. Like there really isn’t a light at the end of the tunnel is there? I’ve just assumed the world owed me so happiness at some point but nope. It’s so disgruntling. What have I done in my life to deserve the pain of loneliness? I’ll never claim to be a good person, ever. There’s people who I’d argue are worse than me tho and they do great for themselves; Why am I the outlier? 
I feel like people don’t even realize how painful being alone is. Like who the fuck do you talk to when you have a problem? Friends are great and I have some good ones but you can only bitch about the same problem so many times before they have to move on with their lives. 
Fuck me forreal tho, I know I’m dramatic and say shit, but I truly believe I’m never gonna find anyone or amount to anything. What the fuck am I even good for other than bitching about shit. 
I do not believe there is a single soul below me, I am the worst of the worst, the absolute bottom of the totem pole. All I do is waste oxygen and occupy space.

"No physical contacts. ""No"" relationships. No friends/people to talk with at all, and can't talk without feel that you ruin they're mood. ""Work"" like ""psychotherapist"". Maybe have depression.","Long story short if you do not want to read it all and if you read title:

1. I've never been hugged for real in all my 16 years (Mother do not count, and i start avoiding it and completly block all physical contact)
2. My longest ""realtionship"" were 1 hour
3. All people that i talked to - ALWAYS, no matter what, lying to me and disappearing.
4. I do not feel attraction to human body at all, but still want have relationship even if i know that's impossible with my temper.

If you want to read full post, here it goes.

&amp;#x200B;

Hi, i do not want to reveal my name or so, only what i can say about my identity that i hate - i am 16 years old, live in russia (no stereotypes). Tou already can say its only hormones, but i think they do like \~5% of that

I would like to write all stories in order from title.

&amp;#x200B;

1. **No Physical Contacts (real ones)**

That's true, i've never been hugged or kissed (for real) in my life. I know that's okay and can happen, but anyway it feel like everyone avoiding contact with me.""For real"" - means that i've never been hugged or kissed with some emotions, all what i got is fake hug everytime when i go home and see off my schoolmate, and even then i know it was fake and she did it because she abuse me for her profit. How i knew it? Well, she find herself a boyfriend and still call me walk with them. No, it was fun, but when she broke up with him, she just asked her mother for 10k ""moral compensation"", and he got to hospital because of drugs (i need that detail later)

Also i have gratueted from school (now completly isolate my self from socium), like everyone, where i was bullied hard. They took my money, they punch me sometimes for fun, swearing of course, and so on. That continues before 9th grade, when we all suddenly team up to close this exams. It was good to, no problem, but first 8 years was NOT that good.

&amp;#x200B;

2. **""No"" relationships**

You can say that i am lying, because i've also say i've been in rs for 1 freaking hour. But i can't say it was rs at all. Like lol, we met up, go through shop, buy snacks, sit on concrete (my favorite place, hard to explain, imagine this like bench, but it square shaped) AND THEN HER BOYFRIEND APPEARED AND TOOK HER AWAY! I DID NOT EVEN KNOW ABOUT HIM! She was not the same girl from #1, but also about her...

Dec 31. 2017 as i remember (yes, 12 years old) i typed her that i love and i want at least to try, FUCKING TRY, experience relationship and know what it is, but no, she blocked me, resend it to all my class and laugh at me.

&amp;#x200B;

3. **No friends/people to talk with at all, and can't talk without feel that you ruin they're mood.**

Everytime i say something about me, i try to lie and avoid it, because i do not want to ruin that funny mood and give saddness to people. Even this account, i think, need to be deleted after this post, to no one more saw this. No matter is that person my mom, friend (at the time), psychotherapist, that's my problem and only i need to find solution (self-contradiction, but yes.)

&amp;#x200B;

4. **Work like psychotherapist.**

Also a problem, because i have my problems, and i (without realizing or paying attention) help people to take they're problems away. I know about hitchhiker's syndrome, when you can say anything that bother you to unknown people, that's why i can type it all here, but still when you hear it all about someone being raped, someone have family cult (me too, lol), and in main time have problems with communicate or with understanding people... Oof. So many people just randomly find me in twitter or VK or so and our dialog goes to problems and bad stories, but ok, i do not mind it, type all your problems, i can answer and help, but please, **PLEASE,** can you NOT IGNORE and NOT THROW me to blocked list after you do that? I have so many stories... No, all people say that one thing:- You are wonderful person! Thank you for help! I really want to become like you and help other people!...

What do you think?

\- Stop message me, nerdor

\-Yea, yea, i am just busy, can you wait?  
\*after 2 months\*  
\- I AM SORRY PLS I STILL LIKE YOU OF COURSE I AM NOT LYING!  
\*completly wiped\*

I just do not understand, why can you say in my face that one phrase: ""Thank you for help, good luck in life"" and then leave, why you need to be rude?  
Because of that, now i can't normally talk and go to chats, even furry ones, i just can't say ""How's been your day?"" cuz they already talk on they're wave, about they're themes and about they're interest... They do not interest in me or what i can say and i just leave

And also in this section i can notice that for past 1,5 year i really, **really,** jump into ""dark"" telegram channels about pedophiels, gore and so, even if i ready to vomit. idk why, but that a thing for me (i am not a pedophile, i hate gore)

Okay, in conclussion: **I Maybe have depression.** or its selfblock, idk, but i want to see if here someone like me.

If you want to advise me, PLEASE, I BEG YOU, can you not write typical ones? Like try to sleep, workout, healthy food. I just do not want to hurt anyone and not be aggresive to someone here.

"I'm sick of life and if things keep on going on like this, I'm ending it.","I don't even know where to start, it all feels so enmeshed. I really hate life and everything about it, especially me. To start, I kinda have a family who don't give a shit about me yet try to control me and every decision I make. They mock me for everything I do, whether be it how ugly I am or how terrible I sound when I sing, or how terrible my music is. I've accepted it all at this point because even I know I am a loser. Yet after showing such neglect, they control all my future life choices. Almost everything. I can't choose a career of my choice, I can't plan anything. Instead I'm constantly pressurized to study 22 hours a day (""like my perfect cousins who are born only to the luckiest people"" unlike them). Even upon getting straight A's most of my life, it's not enough. It's mediocre. As if this wasn't enough, my sister found out about me being bi, relentlessly blackmailed me only to out me to them. They hate me more than ever. They don't even try to understand and constantly berate me about it. And as if this wasn't enough, my dad gets home drunk every night, causing my mom to lose her shit and both of them fighting like hell, only later to blame me for it all. I hate myself. I'm not a good person either, I'm just another one of those lazy attention seekers because I never tried to change myself according to them. I only kept on doing what suited me selfishly. I don't know how to proceed from here. It feels so numbing, and I just haven't cried to my heart's content in 2 years. I just hate how ugly and broken I am, in and out. I can't look at myself without cringing. I am so ignorant. I know everything is my fault. But yet I don't want to die. It's killing me, this pain every where in my body especially my heart.

I am so tired of being conversation raped forcing me into a corner like an animal when I am not prepared.
“Life does go as you like you won’t always be able to have thing on your terms”

This is a controlled environment with family how is that comparable to normal life.
Why am I not allowed to take a rain check when I know it will be impossible to be nice and have an amiable conversation in that moment.
I just want peace all they want is thingy to go their way... if only I was some mindless robot programmed with their specific construed standards of what love respect and family is.
Asking when have I threatened you right after a threat to kick me out.

How am I supposed to get on my feet after a fight for my life with depression when my family’s expectations are so crushing. 
What can I do against someone that weaponizes everything I say and believes every assumption they make about me ignoring my own words.
If I was tried to use my depression to get space I would prolly be thrown in a hospital with the way they are jumping to conclusions and making drastic decisions.

"Waking up crying, loneliness, uselessness, pessimism. These words describe me.","I am recovering from a recent break up that I’m still not over. He was the absolute love of my life and now he’s gone. We were however long distance but I found myself so happy with him. I felt like everything was right with my world. He accepted my body, my passions, and my interests. He accepted me as a person. We were one in the same. 

I think about the break up so often, and it still hurts so bad. I’m useless and I’ll never find a replacement for him. No one will ever love a depressed 23 year old like me. No one will ever love a girl who cries in her sleep if she’s depressed. No one loves the girl with anxiety. No one will understand the passions I have. 

On a regular basis I like to think I’m friendly, and welcoming but in reality I hate myself so much and I’m so depressed and anxious that life becomes unbearable. I don’t think I’d ever kill myself. Simply because I’m afraid of death, but I’ve noticed I think about it more and more when things get stressful. 
I was talking to my mom about life, school, bill and student loan repayment and I said “what’s the point, I’ll die anyway.” I think she understood that I was really depressed then, but its a little too late. She yelled at me earlier for being too anxious to return something in the store. Actually yelled at me. It felt like everyone was staring at me and laughing. I wanted to shrivel up and die right there.. 

I’ll never be fully happy. No one will love me, I mean.. who could? I’m depressed, anxious, ugly and fat. I hate myself so much, who could love this. 

I have never even held hands with a guy... never kissed. I probably never will. I’m too afraid to go out and meet people and I’m only ever comfortable online. The moment people see me in real life, I’m sure they’re disgusted and fear me. I fear myself too. I can’t even look in the mirror without feeling repulsed.

What is wrong with me,"Self loathing and sadness have been the main things on my mind for the last couple of years. My brain is constantly reminding itself that I am sad, but I don’t even know what that means. Going to sleep each night, all I’ve thought about in a long time is how much I hate myself, or of harming myself or suicid e  because no one would care after a while (which I know is probably a lie but I think about it anyway), and I also think about someone asking if I am okay and actually meaning it, because no one has ever done that before.

Yet, in an effort to not disappoint or bore the people around me, I have kept these thoughts to myself. It’s so hard to pretend and I keep letting people down which I feel so shitty about.

Im fucking 17 and I have my whole life ahead of me but everything just feels like shit and I dont know where to start.

College apps just reminded me that soon everything is gonna change and I dont fucking want that. I'm more than qualified for most schools, but I'm still stressed about getting in and what will happen when I go. Right now I dont even want to go to college and I dont want to work either.

Because of covid I have lost almost all of my friends except 1. And I don't want to be just friends with her. And apparently she felt the same way about me. But she has a boyfriend now. I wish I had fucking known though. How could I not have. We met on a church trip and due to lucky circumstances we didn't have an adult leader on the top of the boat for our group, so we ended up staying up late. 2 days in she fell asleep on my lap after she saw a shooting star for the first time in her life. On night 3 we were playing truth or dare, and I just found out in the same conversation where I found out she liked me that she told the guy that dared me to kiss her to give me that dare. She stole like 3 of my hoodies and I just thought it was normal. She made me sit next to her on the bus ride home and we talked for 4 ficking hours. She forced me to go to my own schools homecoming with her even though I didn't want to go cause it was 30 minutes after a football game I had to play in (and our school sucks). How the fuck could I not know she liked me. But now I've had to listen to her talk about how her boyfriend (she's 16 im 17 he just turned 18 and is built like the fucking hulk) almost got her pregnant twice. You know how much that shit hurts. And now she isn't talking to me as much as she had been recently and I dont know why And it fucking sucks. 

The only time I feel anything other than dread and the urge to cry even though I know I can't is when I see a notification from her. When I see it I always smile and something in my stomach just feels good and I have just a wave of happy roll though me. But now that she isn't talking to me as much it has just made everything so much worse and I just can't bring myself to do anything. 

I just don't want to fucking live anymore, I hate the present and fear the future and literally the only reason that I haven't ended it yet is cause when she was depressed I told her that if she killed herself I will too, and she told me she would do the same and I dont want that. 

I know sleep will help but I have been going to bed earlier and earlier every night and I still stay up till like 3-4 am just wishing I could cry or just express some sort of emotion.

I just want to end it, and I really wish I could but I just can't bring myself to it. I'm trying to give myself every chance I can... I'm keeping a knife collection, and I purposely bought a car without airbags and seat belts I know won't work (door mounted ftw) just so I have a chance, but I dont have to do it to myself.  

I dont even know what to say, it just felt good to get that off my chest, cause I know I can't tell anyone I know about this. Thanks for reading, and im sorry if it sucked. I'm sitting in my (parked)car on mobile so it isnt easy to type well.

Some person to whom I can be open.,"I'm 19, since recent 10 months, I've totally lost reason to live another day. Multiple failures in academics, overthinking, regression and guilt about past decisions, sleepless nights, resulting in oversleeping, complete absence of interest in sports, movies and hanging out with friends which I used to love before. The absence of interest being so dense, couldn't even think of leaving my room. Despite knowing its side effects, I've started smoking few times a week, at least it helps lightening both heart and brain, although I don't want to continue it and find a better option.
And since all these months, I'm keeping it all upto myself without letting anyone know, fear of being judged. There is a little discord between my parents so couldn't approach to them either, later considered venting to my friends irl about it, however I know they are the ones who will be friendly and supportive from front but talk shit behind the back, for them it would be another story for backbitching. Next option were those few friends I made on internet, they seem to have similar way of thinking as me but since our communication is only through texts, it would be tough to convey the feelings without being judged.

What am I supposed to do when I literally have no appetite?,"I know it’s a common symptom of depression but what am I supposed to do about it? I used to love food and have progressively gone from eating breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks to just eating dinner most days (even which I probably wouldn’t eat if I didn’t have to). 

My mom thinks I’m developing an eating disorder (which I’m not) and I keep telling her I just don’t have an appetite and that eating just isn’t something I want to do since food just isn’t appealing. Never really had this happen but my appetite has gone down to nothing over the past month or so.

Edit: I’m still somewhat hunger (duh- haven’t eaten in a while each day) but I just can’t stomach the idea of eating for some reason.

I feel so lost,"I don't feel like typing out everything, but I'll probably update later on. I have CPTSD. I'm sad. I think my boyfriend is manipulative and doesn't realize it, and I don't know what to do. My first ever pet rat is very old (3) and I think a lot about if he's going to make it to Christmas or not, and I just want to cry. I have a twin sister and I love her so very much, but we dont talk as much because she's at college, and doesn't have a lot of time to talk. I don't want to think about visiting my parental units and brother for the holidays because they suck, but I also don't want to not go because my sister will be there, and she'll want to see me obviously. I don't feel like I have to, because my grandparents aren't visiting this year because of COVID. I put on a whole bunch of weight after maintaining an 85 pound weight loss for two years. All of it. All of it went back on because I was depressed and binge eating everyday to cope. I was struggling with family issues, and I still am. They weren't good people growing up, and honestly don't ever want to see my dad again. My boyfriend makes me feel guilty about it because he doesn't have a dad but he also has a ""fuck your family"" kind of attitude. Which, I do too. They did a lot of things when I was a kid that made me never want to see them again, but I feel so broken and torn about it. I don't know if I love my dad, I don't think I do. I feel guilty when I don't see them, or talk to them. I'm just so hurt. My boyfriend quit his job and has been trying to find a new one with no luck, so I started working more to make up for the lack thereof, and I can pay rent this month, and next until he has a job. We just might have world's smallest Christmas, which, I mean, it's okay. I love him, and he loves me (or so he says. I have my doubts) and all I really care about is having a good time, and one holiday where nobody yells at each other AT ALL. I've never had one holiday where there wasn't any arguing or yelling at us or anything, so I have some low hopes for this year, but I'm not expecting much. My boyfriend has bad trust issues(that's a whole story) and I feel like he uses that against me sometimes, but we've lived together for a full year, and have spent nearly everyday together except when we were working. He thinks I'm cheating on him, and will accuse me of such, when I have no intention to whatsoever. When we first started dating, I was open and honest and shared many things relating to my past relationships. I've cheated on every guy I've been with in the past but only because 1. I wanted to break up with them. and 2. It had been a month or two and I wasn't feeling it, and was going to break up with them. Usually when I did cheat, the break up would be the following day. We've been together for a minute, and I'm not the person I used to be anymore. All I've been is honest from the beginning. Recently, I've felt like cutting myself, which I haven't self-harmed since I was in 8th grade. I've also felt like going back to my bulimia. Every time I drive, I just think about hitting a guard rail at full speed or getting in a major car accident, almost like those things are just waiting to happen. I'm really stressed out, but have been managing that to the best of my ability. I want to get high, and do coke. I feel like I'm not as smart anymore. I used to be so bright and so good at school work, and I'm really intelligent. My brain just feels BLAH and it's scary to me because my mind is important to me, but also the worst part about me. It's like my brain is one big grey area. I want to go back to school, but I don't have any money to. Everyone in my apartment complex has hardwood floors and nice kitchens and we have carpet from the 70's and an old af kitchen, but we all pay the same price (to my knowledge).

ugh. I'm so sad thinking about my rat boy. I love him so so so much. I'm just waiting for the day when he's no longer. I check him for tumors everyday, and keep an eye on his movement. He's slowed down a lot because of age, and if he was hurting, I wouldn't quite know because rats can hide it really well. He almost passed away. He was acting funny, and it looked like he was breathing really really hard. I took him to the vet and he had a respiratory infection. If I hadn't done so, he probably wouldn't have made it out because of his age. I just want my rat boy to live forever.

There's another one living very close. He passes by my house 3x a day, 3 times a week. All he does is stare at me and make stupid hand gestures. Haven't talked to him in about 8 weeks.

Self-Loathing,"Is there anyone else that struggles with this? It’s a very confusing mix of emotions because it feels good to fester in my own self hatred and criticism as odd as that sounds. I listen to music that fuels these emotions, I isolate myself and make myself unavailable to others, and convince myself that I am garbage. It’s a very destructive thought pattern that comes with harmful coping mechanisms. On the contrary, I’m confident in myself and my abilities. I believe that I am a good person at heart but the things I’ve done in the past to people who I’ve truly loved and cared about, haunt me. And even though I’m on the right path now with therapy, counseling, and medication, I still hold my past actions against myself even though I know I’m a different person now. I would blame everything on my mental illness but at this point it feels like a cheap cop out to justify why I’m such a terrible person. I would just like to make things right with the people that I’ve wronged but I’ve used up all my chances and I’ll never get to express my feelings to them. I feel like not being able to clear the air is what’s driving this mindset because as long as they still view me as that same person that hurt them, then that’s who I am and always will be. This makes it even harder to get closer to new people because I don’t want to hurt anyone else and I feel like the only way that’s possible is by staying away and isolating myself.",kaizarimperatrix,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy7r8f/selfloathing/,anyone else struggle confusing mix emotion feel good fester self hatred criticism odd sound listen music fuel emotion isolate make unavailable others convince garbage destructive thought pattern come harmful coping mechanism contrary confident ability believe good person heart thing done past people truly loved cared haunt even though right path therapy counseling medication still hold past action even though know different person would blame everything mental illness point feel like cheap cop justify terrible person would like make thing right people wronged used chance never get express feeling feel like able clear air driving mindset long still view person hurt always make even harder get closer new people want hurt anyone else feel like way possible staying away isolating,self loathing,kai zar imperatrix,1434,13,kai zar imperatrix anyone else struggle confusing mix emotion feel good fester self hatred criticism odd sound listen music fuel emotion isolate make unavailable others convince garbage destructive thought pattern come harmful coping mechanism contrary confident ability believe good person heart thing done past people truly loved cared haunt even though right path therapy counseling medication still hold past action even though know different person would blame everything mental illness point feel like cheap cop justify terrible person would like make thing right people wronged used chance never get express feeling feel like able clear air driving mindset long still view person hurt always make even harder get closer new people want hurt anyone else feel like way possible staying away isolating self loathing
An explanation that seemed to work,"Depression is different than being depressed. But unless you have depression, it's hard to understand how it can't be caused by something, aka being depressed.

Inevitably, you'll have to explain depression vs being depressed and I thought I'd share a recent analogy that seemed to resonate.

*Analogy*


Imagine that you have a normal day, or even a great day. It doesn't matter, because in the morning, you wake up 100lbs heavier. 

What's even weirder is that you're the only one that sees the weight, but it still affects you physically. You look at the mirror and you look fine, but you can see it when looking directly at your new chub.

It's harder to move around, and harder to breathe--youre tired.

None of your clothes look right so you just go with the simplest thing. You're so shocked at your physical change that basic hygiene and appearance just seem pointless. (Can't explain how you can wear the same stuff).

You're self conscious of your weight and unkept appearance, so you avoid people.

You don't really feel like eating because you just gained 100lbs overnight, you're lethargic. Ok, you might sneak some food but just the minimum to not feel sick and it was purely a chore...a hard chore.

Then, you may even say 'fk it' and order a cake or tub of ice cream for food. Sugar rush feels a bit better, for a minute.

Your whole sense of self has been shook. You tell yourself that this is just depression kicking in, and you know it and can prove it, but that realization doesn't matter. 

You start questioning the validity of your most dear relationships--do they even like you? Do they even love you?

You question your sense of meaning, of life. 

Nothing really matters that much.",hammilithome,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy6c7q/an_explanation_that_seemed_to_work/,depression different depressed unless depression hard understand caused something aka depressed inevitably explain depression v depressed thought share recent analogy seemed resonate analogy imagine normal day even great day matter morning wake 100lbs heavier even weirder one see weight still affect physically look mirror look fine see looking directly new chub harder move around harder breathe youre tired none clothes look right go simplest thing shocked physical change basic hygiene appearance seem pointless explain wear stuff self conscious weight unkept appearance avoid people really feel like eating gained 100lbs overnight lethargic ok might sneak food minimum feel sick wa purely chore hard chore may even say fk order cake tub ice cream food sugar rush feel bit better minute whole sense self ha shook tell depression kicking know prove realization matter start questioning validity dear relationship even like even love question sense meaning life nothing really matter much,explanation seemed work,ham milit home,1707,34,ham milit home depression different depressed unless depression hard understand caused something aka depressed inevitably explain depression v depressed thought share recent analogy seemed resonate analogy imagine normal day even great day matter morning wake 100lbs heavier even weirder one see weight still affect physically look mirror look fine see looking directly new chub harder move around harder breathe youre tired none clothes look right go simplest thing shocked physical change basic hygiene appearance seem pointless explain wear stuff self conscious weight unkept appearance avoid people really feel like eating gained 100lbs overnight lethargic ok might sneak food minimum feel sick wa purely chore hard chore may even say fk order cake tub ice cream food sugar rush feel bit better minute whole sense self ha shook tell depression kicking know prove realization matter start questioning validity dear relationship even like even love question sense meaning life nothing really matter much explanation seemed work

Vent post :(,"I’ve been really sad and depressed since I was a kid, but I always felt like it was for a good reason. When I was a kid it was because I was in an abusive home but as I got older and even now as I live independently, I genuinely believe that anyone smart would be depressed considering the current state of the world. 

Even when I was suicidal and attempted to end my life, I didn’t want to actually die. That concept was terrifying to me and still is. The fact that I got so close to dying is the reason I won’t try again. I want to live. I have several dreams and aspirations, reasons to live. But I just know that I will NEVER be happy in the world we live in now. I’ll never have the time or energy to create, learn and explore the things that make me happy. The pain of existence in this society is so unbearable some days I feel like I could explode, other days I completely shut down and can’t even think or move. Even outside of my minuscule personal shit there is so much suffering in this world currently and in the past. It hurts to know what humans are capable of. The future looks darker every day. 

I’m trying to be healthier and not self destruct or ruin my life like I have in the past and all that has helped me lately is literally just getting lost in my thoughts and daydreams. I want to hurt myself so bad and this is all I can do to stop myself. Even at work, i’m physically there but doing everything possible to disconnect from where I am and make up games and scenario is in my head to make it bearable. I still have intrusive thoughts about ending my life at work every single day. Especially since all my coworkers complain about how slow I am and how I never pull my own weight. I can’t even tell them how I really feel because it would probably get me fired since I work in the medical field. 

What could I even say? It takes every ounce of energy just to get out of bed, I’m so irritable and resentful towards everything and everyone. sometimes I’m slow because I had to shut down so I wouldn’t blow up, cry or do something drastic. Sometimes I hide in the bathroom because I get so overwhelmed with negativity. But I got in trouble for that so I can’t even do that...

As this whole thing has progressed I’ve basically gotten to a place where I feel like a literal child and just cry all the time and want to be held and comforted. The only thing that makes me feel slightly better is acting like a child, buying cute toys and trying to disconnect from the current reality. Childhood is the only part of my life I feel like was me. Now I don’t even know who I am or what I want.

I just want to disappear but I can’t die, self harm or turn to any of my old coping mechanisms. I just feel so lost....",belugabeach,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy7lmc/vent_post/,really sad depressed since wa kid always felt like wa good reason wa kid wa wa abusive home got older even live independently genuinely believe anyone smart would depressed considering current state world even wa suicidal attempted end life want actually die concept wa terrifying still fact got close dying reason try want live several dream aspiration reason live know never happy world live never time energy create learn explore thing make happy pain existence society unbearable day feel like could explode day completely shut even think move even outside minuscule personal shit much suffering world currently past hurt know human capable future look darker every day trying healthier self destruct ruin life like past ha helped lately literally getting lost thought daydream want hurt bad stop even work physically everything possible disconnect make game scenario head make bearable still intrusive thought ending life work every single day especially since coworkers complain slow never pull weight even tell really feel would probably get fired since work medical field could even say take every ounce energy get bed irritable resentful towards everything everyone sometimes slow shut blow cry something drastic sometimes hide bathroom get overwhelmed negativity got trouble even whole thing ha progressed basically gotten place feel like literal child cry time want held comforted thing make feel slightly better acting like child buying cute toy trying disconnect current reality childhood part life feel like wa even know want want disappear die self harm turn old coping mechanism feel lost,vent post,beluga beach,2732,12,beluga beach really sad depressed since wa kid always felt like wa good reason wa kid wa wa abusive home got older even live independently genuinely believe anyone smart would depressed considering current state world even wa suicidal attempted end life want actually die concept wa terrifying still fact got close dying reason try want live several dream aspiration reason live know never happy world live never time energy create learn explore thing make happy pain existence society unbearable day feel like could explode day completely shut even think move even outside minuscule personal shit much suffering world currently past hurt know human capable future look darker every day trying healthier self destruct ruin life like past ha helped lately literally getting lost thought daydream want hurt bad stop even work physically everything possible disconnect make game scenario head make bearable still intrusive thought ending life work every single day especially since coworkers complain slow never pull weight even tell really feel would probably get fired since work medical field could even say take every ounce energy get bed irritable resentful towards everything everyone sometimes slow shut blow cry something drastic sometimes hide bathroom get overwhelmed negativity got trouble even whole thing ha progressed basically gotten place feel like literal child cry time want held comforted thing make feel slightly better acting like child buying cute toy trying disconnect current reality childhood part life feel like wa even know want want disappear die self harm turn old coping mechanism feel lost vent post
Reality,"I wish my spirit could float in the sky for a while. A blissful being just watching the colors change as the sun sets and rises again. 

I suppose the closest I can be to that ideal is forcing myself to live in my candy colored reality. It's probably not real, and people look at me funny when I talk though its filter. It's my coping mechanism, because I can't bare to return and have the real world hit me.

I feel like i dont deserve a place in this world. I sincerely want to die.,"Hey. I wanted to share my thoughts and feeling bc i can't bare them anymore.

Im 22M, im studying  Mechanical Engineering and Machine Building. Im also a singer ( growler) for my band and i feel like i dont deserve a place in this world. I sincerely want to die. All my life, I was just a kind guy, trying not to hurt anyone, live the life as peaceful as i could. But there came a moment, when I realized. Im noone. With no skills, no experience that can help me fulfill my goals in life, no skills to deffend myslef, with no friends to share this ugly thoughts(plus no social skills whatsoever). 

My parents think that I'll be sucesful in life,  bc my degree is hard, but i know that's bullshit. It's not hard at all. I'm getting throug every year of eductaion with struggle. I'm forgetting about everything I've learned, so i can't transfer that knowledge to my ""employment life"".  At every step of my life im getting informed that im just average, or below that ( especially  by my teachers and mates)(And thats basically true. No matter how I try, Im recognised as average person with no future). Everyday of my life im  observing, how  everyone in my  environment is changing/developing and im standing in the same place as 5-10 yrs ago. All I can do in life is to growl(that' s subjective) and learn(with struggle). I'm getting a lot enjoyment form listenning to music(it realy  emotional  for me), but im loosing hearing in my right ear (XD!). I've had a gf for 3 yrs(17-20), I thought this will help me heal, but instaed, I had to heal her from her borderdline dissorder. That  relationship  was only a  blend of toxicity, inspection and SEX( At last I've got out from this). I've broke up with her right before my 21st birthday. Everything that happened to me after that was just a infinite sequence of failures. I've tried to work on myslef, developed few new habbits. I've started to read more books, look into and undersand my feelings. I stared to learn gutitar. But it was all non senese.  I' made (I thought so)  good connection with one of my mates, It turned out, he had to make a friend for 2-3 months untill his true friend comes back from work outside of our country. I've been helping him with his struggles (girls, suicidal thoughts, problems at house(his parents were going though a divorce)), we had really good connection, spending every free moment with each other, untill the end of september, when his friend came back. I gave him all i had,  i thought I will be able to ask for help later, even if it had to be i condition of  ""debt of gratitude""( but i thought it was a true friendship). But it didn't happen. I've been just forggoten as the rock that you kick on the way to home form work/school. Im striggling to create smth new for my band. Im struggling to make a new mate. Im struggling with my studdies(Im able to help other in the class, but i feel helpless anyway), I have no one to talk about anything in my life. Im worried that my father is falling into alcoholism(mb bc his son is a failure), my mother is in danger of getting cancer ( that the easiest way to explain this). I just have no strenght to live further. I feel like i just wanna give up and sleep endlessly.

“Why are you ignoring me”,"
When they reprimand me for leaving a dish in the sink or not putting my shoes in my closet I just want to break down. I have kept this together so long. But I just want to scream as loudly as I can “why won’t you help me?” 

I want to hurt their feelings. I want their limbs to go numb because they’ve never heard me sound like that before. 

I want the look in my mothers eyes to be so contorted with horror and shock I’ll be afraid she’s going to have a heart attack. 

“Why do you make me live every day like this?”

“Why won’t you do anything?” 

“Are you stupid?” 

“Why won’t you help me?”

Am I depressed or am I just not living properly,"As the title suggests, I’m unsure if I’m going through a depression spell or my current situation and lifestyle is causing me to feel awful about myself. I’m currently living in the UK which is currently going through its second lockdown, recently have just been let go from my job and had a really difficult breakup which has forced me to move back home. On top of this I now need £43,500 to study a Masters in Finance Analysis at LBS which I’ve been planning to do for years. 

I have a plan in place to get my life back on track. For example; I’ve set up a company with a friend from university; revising for exams to get get scholarships for the masters I’ve mentioned above, and been really getting into my running of late. 

However, I’m feeling that I’m losing interest in everything. I’m not enjoying spending time at home with my family, not even wanting to try and get back on the dating scene or speak to my friends and struggling to get out of bed in the mornings. I’m also finding it difficult to recall memories as I’m feeling so empty right now. At the moment my screen time is exceeding 4 hrs a day on average which is primarily consists scrolling through youtube, Instagram and Facebook. These are some of the features which appears quite common on this feed.

Now typically I’m quite a confident, resilient and sociable person but I’m feeling that I’m losing that of late. I feel that a combination of not being able to do activities during lockdown, my destruction of my previous relationship and losing my job might have contributed to that. Usually, I use the gym if I’m feeling shitty to give myself endorphins and to power through or go outside and do activities (this is difficult in the UK atm as all gyms are closed).However, I’m worried that if this continues I might not be able to come out of the headspace that I’m in.

The main reason for posting this onto this feed is to get this off my chest as I haven’t felt I’ve been able to share this with anyone. Also the fact that this is a r/depression feed I want to know if this is just this just a phase due to the current circumstance or this is spiralling out of control and becoming more of a serious issue. 

Now I’ve had unwarranted suicidal urges where I just wanted to end things; however, I keep on reminding myself that I have a family that love me and it would destroy my mother if she lost her only child to suicide especially since my sister died when I was younger. 

Any support or advice would be really appreciated and if anyone is feeling hopeless I want to reach my hand out to give my help.",trading-wrong,8,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy0z2d/am_i_depressed_or_am_i_just_not_living_properly/,title suggests unsure going depression spell current situation lifestyle causing feel awful currently living uk currently going second lockdown recently let go job really difficult breakup ha forced move back home top need 43 500 study master finance analysis lb planning year plan place get life back track example set company friend university revising exam get get scholarship master mentioned really getting running late however feeling losing interest everything enjoying spending time home family even wanting try get back dating scene speak friend struggling get bed morning also finding difficult recall memory feeling empty right moment screen time exceeding 4 hr day average primarily consists scrolling youtube instagram facebook feature appears quite common feed typically quite confident resilient sociable person feeling losing late feel combination able activity lockdown destruction previous relationship losing job might contributed usually use gym feeling shitty give endorphin power go outside activity difficult uk atm gym closed however worried continues might able come headspace main reason posting onto feed get chest felt able share anyone also fact r depression feed want know phase due current circumstance spiralling control becoming serious issue unwarranted suicidal urge wanted end thing however keep reminding family love would destroy mother lost child suicide especially since sister died wa younger support advice would really appreciated anyone feeling hopeless want reach hand give help,depressed living properly,trading wrong,2587,47,trading wrong title suggests unsure going depression spell current situation lifestyle causing feel awful currently living uk currently going second lockdown recently let go job really difficult breakup ha forced move back home top need 43 500 study master finance analysis lb planning year plan place get life back track example set company friend university revising exam get get scholarship master mentioned really getting running late however feeling losing interest everything enjoying spending time home family even wanting try get back dating scene speak friend struggling get bed morning also finding difficult recall memory feeling empty right moment screen time exceeding 4 hr day average primarily consists scrolling youtube instagram facebook feature appears quite common feed typically quite confident resilient sociable person feeling losing late feel combination able activity lockdown destruction previous relationship losing job might contributed usually use gym feeling shitty give endorphin power go outside activity difficult uk atm gym closed however worried continues might able come headspace main reason posting onto feed get chest felt able share anyone also fact r depression feed want know phase due current circumstance spiralling control becoming serious issue unwarranted suicidal urge wanted end thing however keep reminding family love would destroy mother lost child suicide especially since sister died wa younger support advice would really appreciated anyone feeling hopeless want reach hand give help depressed living properly
Pandemic triggering my anxiety and possibly depression,"I’m struggling with a lot of anxiety these days, I have constantly been home since march and I started working (WFH) post my graduation this year. But I don’t feel like doing anything, I’m lying on my bed and not doing anything the whole day almost everyday, I cry very very easily, I sorta also feel lonely because I don’t really think I have anyone that close to talk to. My parents don’t think mental health is a real issue so it’s kinda hard for me to know what to do now. One of the major concerns I’ve is I feel palpitations in my chest and feel anxiety almost everyday from as soon as I wake up. And I have so much decision making anxiety and I constantly feel I never take the right decisions. I also feel like a semi failure, like I want to change the job I’m working in, just don’t like it here and have a few applications in mind where I want to apply but for that, I need to study first because I legit haven’t done any studies since almost the past year so I don’t think I’m fit to interview at this state and so I want to be prepared first because I’ve constantly failed at a couple of interviews in the past year and don’t want to fail again because I feel I’ll just get more triggered then. I also feel like I constantly undermine myself as in I look at something and I make up my mind that I’m certain that I wouldn’t be able to clear/crack it. (I used to be an extremely studious student in school and was really fairly hardworking in college too but then with time, with certain things or maybe I myself kept pulling myself down and now I just feel I’m not good enough). I really really at times want to work hard and get that job but then all I do is procrastinate and sleep and think that it’s impossible I’ll be able to do it. (Even though I know that if I give a 100% I might be able too???idk). It also seems so tough for me to get myself to do small small tasks such as having a bath everyday, my bed is always a mess. I have basically literally spent 95% of the time since march lying on my bed. I don’t have any hobbies, I don’t think there’s anything I love doing. I’m super sad almost all the time :( I also feel some of these issues are maybe because I have some unresolved trauma from the past but I have no idea what to do about it ?!???

I used to have some of these issues in college too I guess but then there were classes and I used to go out with my friends a lot so I wasn’t left with a lot of time. But now since the pandemic, I haven’t gone out at all, just at home overthinking about everything and this anxiety is really triggering me now.

I highly suggest watch Ted talks,"My mom used to help me when I would cry and couldn’t stop but now I love a state away and I don’t want to always call her to tell her how depressed I am majority of the calls. One time I was crying, even though I have my boyfriend I personally feel like a burden of emotions, I don’t know but I decided to look up on YouTube “stop crying”. A video for a Ted talk about how to be more mentally strong popped up and I watched it. Listening to the woman talk made me stop crying and I began to have a different outlook on how I was handling the problems in my life. The people who speak all tell their personal stories and it feels authentic. I haven’t been able to go back to therapy but these videos feel like a slice of therapy for me. I watch more of these often and they help. I hope this helps someone as well. Some good ones are how to be more optimistic, how to stop negative self thoughts, the mind of a procrastinator, it’s all about mindset. There’s so many videos for a large range of life.

My close friend told me he had suicidal thoughts. Should I tell his parents?,"We were friend since highschool, both of us were studying abroad, and we met occasionally during holidays. We have not come home for about three years. We really enjoyed our time here, away from our parents and completely different in terms of quality of life. During our last year abroad, we were struggling (hard to find jobs and covid) and he told me he hate his life and gave me the sign of being suicidal. I tried my best to keep give him some company by calling him all the time, was not being so negative around him, and i did some other things that kept him entertained. 

Long story short, i came back home early than him.

I can't be fixed.,"I've had depression problems ever since I was about 14. My parents loaded so much money into my mental illness and I was even committed to a Psychiatric ward for a while.

 Now, my husband has poured all kinds of money into my mental health. God, I've been on at least 10 different medications, all with no positive effects. I was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. My GP even suggested Bipolar Disorder, but a Psychitrist dismissed this. 

Point being, I have all these people desperately trying to save me. I always have. I know I can't die. I can't hurt my mother like that. I can't hurt my husband like that. I can't hurt my friends like that. 

I suppose I'm ranting. I've been wondering if this is it for me. It comes to a certain point to where you just don't think you can be fixed. I'm in my 20's and this has been a battle for 10+ years. I don't think I can be fixed. I must be in the percentage of depressed people that cannot be fixed. Nothing has worked. Many medications and no amount of therapy has helped.

I feel like I was made to be that person you make fun of,"Remeber that kid from school who just never seemed to fit in

Whose laugh sounded like its been a while since he had one

Whose eyes seemed empty 

Whose conversations felt random, confusing and weird

I remember that kid and i remember me

Said i’ll never get him and whats going on in his mind

Said i dont get it, what wrong and why cant he fight

Said i dont care its his problem and he was born like that

Said a few jokes that I now regret

Now I see those empty eyes, and hear that awkward laugh, and that shaking voice which utters words at random

But I see it in me and i’ve become the joke
And once I got here it felt like it’s going to last forever

I’ve always wanted to be funny, to make people laugh, and so i became

Now they laugh

And now I’m funny

So I guess I should be thankful i got what i wanted

I now know you felt it

I know you saw it

You knew you were a joke

"Just venting. Sharing it with others makes it easier, feels like I belong somewhere.","I miss you.
There, I said it. It's not the first, nor the last time I'll say it, and the feeling of hurt, sadness, and longing still remains as if it was the first time I said it. 
I know you don't like when I say it. I know you want me to be happy, and  be satisfied with my life, want me to move on, find someone else, be happy with myself.
I have tried. I tried so hard, so many times, I try to go up that ladder, seeing you up there, happy and comfortable, and then, i slip, and that small distance, becomes so big I can barely see you, and I tried to go up again, always ending with me falling, deeper each time. 

I am sorry. I am sorry I annoyed you so much, with texts, pictures, trying to hold on to that small thread we still had. I am sorry I annoyed you. I was the only one still trying to bring something that didn't exist anymore, and trying to make it whole again. 

I am not happy, not with myself nor with my life. Ive fucked up multiple times, and I find myself in a hole so deep, with no ladder, and almost with no light. I want to give up, want to throw it all away, but I cant find the courage yet, and if i do, I hope you wont hear about it, I hope you remain happy, I hope you grow more and more, fly higher and higher to your bright bright future, because you deserve it. 

I used to write stories to you, write poems about you, about us, about everything, and now, I can barely wrote anything anymore, my mind doesn't want to think, my hands dont want to write, I just cant do anything right anymore. 

I know. Its been so long, almost two years, and still, you live in my heart. Ive tried kicking you out, but you still come back, my memories of you come back, my memories of us, of everything, and it hurts, it hurts all the time. 

You know, I wish we could talk, I wish I could tell you how great my life is being, how great College is going, how many friends I made, how im writing, how I am good. But im not, College is going horribly, I haven't made any friends, I actually lost a lot of them. I am not ok. I have no energy anymore.

I hope you understand I tried. I really did, I tried so hard, but, I just cant seem to do it anymore, ive lost it. 

This is just, another text, another text I wont send you, and you will never read. 
I don't want to bother you anymore, I know you only answer to the things I used to send you because you are nice and don't want to hurt others. You are a great person. 

I am not. 
Not anymore. 

I am tired. 
Very tired. 

I feel each day getting darker, each morning harder, each day colder, each week more of a pain...

Need help.,"I live my life constantly questioning who I am. I question if what I’m doing is the right thing. I question if every interaction I have with other people is the right reaction or the wrong reaction. To be honest it fucks me up. All I ever wanna be is a good person, I wanna be the person that everyone has something good to say about. I fear I’m not that person, and it’s weird because I don’t give a shit what people think of me. At the same time though, I do I really do. I feel that I over analyze every encounter I have. I’m a selfish piece of shit that feels like I’ve done nothing wrong in my life but I still seem to piss everyone off around me. I have divorced parents who I can’t seem to make happy even though I’ve never been to jail, I’ve never been addicted to substances, I’ve made a somewhat decent living for myself an honest living. I’ve done nothing but good in my life, sure I’ve broken a few hearts here and there but nothing that’s been done to me. I just feel like whatever I do whatever decision I make in life it’s always going to be the wrong decision. I just wanna find that ultimate guidance but I know I’ll never find it. It leads me to a very uncertain future. A future that ends in only one way and it’s bad, I knows it’s not the right decision but fuck what can someone do. You have an individual that’s made a decent life, never gotten into any serious trouble isn’t a bad person but yet always constantly feels he/she is always fucking up. The only way I see things getting better is to fucking call it a day and end it. I want to end it I want to stop this suffering this bullshit that I feel like I’m constantly letting others down.

"a few months ago I was ready to go, depression and addiction had taken over, but then something happened..","I had about 100 days clean just before the virus hit, once my sobriety system got disrupted I didn't know how to respond. So I started hanging with my buddies who party and they have a party house that is everything you want, karaoke, a casino room, a coke dealer who lived there, and girls. For about 7 weekends straight I would drink shots of vodka, chain smoke, do a few gs of cocaine, and pop trazodone to go to sleep.

It was like the sweetest nightmare with really high highs, and very very low hangover comedown days so dark that I thought of ending my life because I felt like I failed myself. Then something devastating happened, it was my birthday and I woke up to the news my good buddy Zach overdosed on heroin. I immediately started to cry and told myself I can't go on this way. Later that week I went to his funeral, and it was the saddest thing watching his parents and two kids having to say goodbye, I promised myself I wouldn't do that to my family and that I would be a recovery advocate from then on.

I got help, therapy read books, and got back into my fitness and health routine. And I also got back to my passion for music.  I am a singer/rapper similar to like Eminem or nf people say. I put my heart into my songs. I ended up making a very deep song where I came clean about everything that had been going on, and I released the music video on youtube. And it now has over 40k views with no label or help.

Then the Facebook version has 50k as well as over 800 shares and comments of people telling me they felt every word of my song and how they can relate. I have been humbled by the response.

It releases tonight on all digital music streaming services and I'm feeling a bit emotional. So I felt I would share with my fellow addicts. If you wanna listen to it google search Stylez Major -Lost in a High.

Is it just depression?,"I’ve been feeling bad for 3 years, but this last one year has been the worst. I don’t care about being sad, I just want my brain to work again:(

Steady decline since 2017.,"I was in a crappy relationship in 2017 and I don’t think I’ll ever be the same again. It felt like a part of me died that year and its been slowly affecting the “alive” part of me. I’ve been a lot more irritable, moody and tired since then. That in combination with people generally being assholes in the world, I stopped going out much unless is absolutely necessary. I’m starting to treat my online life the same way. I used to wake up in the morning ready to take on the day, had a good philosophy about life, now I wake up numb and go to bed numb. Its seems like every time a spark goodness happens it’s immediately shot down by something extremely negative. 

I honestly believe I’m cursed. I don’t trust good things in life anymore. Its funny to say but I’m highly suspicious of something genuinely good happening to me because I’m wondering when it will all be taken away. Theres so much crap that happened to me in the last 3 years, you’d think I pissed off a witch or something. I lost 3 years of my life, literally because I don’t remember much other than the bad stuff that happened and because I was too busy trying heal instead of live. 

I don’t actually believe I was able to mentally age in those three years so I’m emotionally stuck in 2017. My soul is stuck in 2017. I’m stuck in 2017. I’ve always been a fan of movies and I’m obsessed with the movies that came in in 2017, the social events that took place, the music, everything. It doesn’t make me feel any better knowing these things, it just lets me know that before and while I was going through what I was going through, these things also occurred. Other things happened. 

Here it is, 2020. 2020 happened and I’m still trying to cope with what happened to me in 2017. I’ve been personally affected by this year and all I have to say is that it accelerated my already ongoing decline into the abyss. I do the bare minimum of hygiene and bathe. At least I can still push myself to do that. I’m just so tired. I’m done trying to human. Why can’t I just be a tree in a forest somewhere? I contemplated going back to school but its so hard to concentrate most days and I already know how I won’t attend class regularly. Not to mention my horrible retention skills. I can’t remember anything, especially not material from a book. I used to enjoy reading books but now my mind wonders too much, unable to grasp what I’m reading, causing me to read a sentence over and over again. Its honestly frustrating. 

I am not suicidal but I do write my own stories involving me going to a remote area, getting killed by something/someone in a romantic sort of way, if that makes any sense to anyone other than my depressed brain. Call it suicidal fantasy. 
I have no problem reading and comprehending what I write oddly enough, so I write often. At least I can enjoy something other than sleep.

Difficulty planning the future.,"So, using a throwaway because I'd rather this wasn't on my main account, looking for some advise.

I'm mostly post treatment these days. My day to day experience is generally more neurotypical than not as long as I keep up with my CBT exercises and things. I've spent the last couple of years building out my support networks so when I do have an episode I have people I can rely on.

But now I feel like I'm stuck, and after some self reflection I think I know why; there is still a decent chunk of my mind that still thinks that eventually I'm going to kill myself, so what's the point in planning for the future.

To be clear, I don't experience ideation anymore, I don't have active suicidal thoughts at all, really, but I'm starting to think that this is the subconscious roadblock that is getting in the way.

I know that I need to sort out my driving license, but a part of me is worried the freedom that brings will make it easier to kill myself in the future. 

I know that I want to seek out new romantic relationships, but a part of me is worried that the stress of doing that will push me closer to wanting to end things.

I think I know, generally, what I want to do with my life career wise, but I struggle with knowing that there is a decent chance any effort I put in to make headway will be spoilt by a moment of weakness and a short fall.

My experience has been that everything I feel as someone living with chronic recurrent depression is something other people have had to work through. Does anyone here have any words of wisdom on getting past this kind of fear? Beyond ""you just have to live life like you aren't going to end it abruptly"", that is.",PostingMcPostyFace,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy02nm/difficulty_planning_the_future/,using throwaway rather main account looking advise mostly post treatment day day day experience generally neurotypical long keep cbt exercise thing spent last couple year building support network episode people rely feel like stuck self reflection think know still decent chunk mind still think eventually going kill point planning future clear experience ideation anymore active suicidal thought really starting think subconscious roadblock getting way know need sort driving license part worried freedom brings make easier kill future know want seek new romantic relationship part worried stress push closer wanting end thing think know generally want life career wise struggle knowing decent chance effort put make headway spoilt moment weakness short fall experience ha everything feel someone living chronic recurrent depression something people work doe anyone word wisdom getting past kind fear beyond live life like going end abruptly,difficulty planning future,posting mc post face,1671,31,posting mc post face using throwaway rather main account looking advise mostly post treatment day day day experience generally neurotypical long keep cbt exercise thing spent last couple year building support network episode people rely feel like stuck self reflection think know still decent chunk mind still think eventually going kill point planning future clear experience ideation anymore active suicidal thought really starting think subconscious roadblock getting way know need sort driving license part worried freedom brings make easier kill future know want seek new romantic relationship part worried stress push closer wanting end thing think know generally want life career wise struggle knowing decent chance effort put make headway spoilt moment weakness short fall experience ha everything feel someone living chronic recurrent depression something people work doe anyone word wisdom getting past kind fear beyond live life like going end abruptly difficulty planning future

a rant.,"does anyone else feel like their mental state deters them from wanting to be in a relationship? or better yet, does anyone else's mental state make them feel like they can't be in a relationship because they have to work on their issues before they can be in one? like shit, i know how hard it is to deal with me. when I have mental breakdowns, I go numb, and I stop caring about everything. i stop thinking. i don't have the mental energy to do much. i become devoid of literally all feeling. people tell me i can work on myself and still be in a relationship but how am i supposed to do that when i literally have periods of time where i don't give a fuck about anything? how am i supposed to put someone else through that? 

i have ended multiple relationships because my mind tells me it's time to put them out of their misery that is being with me. i self sabotage it every single time because i would never want to be with someone like me, and I don't think it's fair to make other people attempt to be with me either. 

it frustrates me to the ends of the Earth when people try to convince me that I can still be with somebody else when I'm like this, and that I can work on myself while being with someone. I don't have access to therapy so it's basically me all on my own. I've been trying to fix myself for years and absolutely nothing I've done has worked. and it's not anyone else's job to fix me. so God forgive me if I'm saving other people from being with me, when I don't last in relationships, because I'm not meant to when I'm like this.",throwawayhehe-,6,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy0xlz/a_rant/,doe anyone else feel like mental state deters wanting relationship better yet doe anyone else mental state make feel like relationship work issue one like shit know hard deal mental breakdown go numb stop caring everything stop thinking mental energy much become devoid literally feeling people tell work still relationship supposed literally period time give fuck anything supposed put someone else ended multiple relationship mind tell time put misery self sabotage every single time would never want someone like think fair make people attempt either frustrates end earth people try convince still somebody else like work someone access therapy basically trying fix year absolutely nothing done ha worked anyone else job fix god forgive saving people last relationship meant like,rant,throwaway,1555,7,throwaway doe anyone else feel like mental state deters wanting relationship better yet doe anyone else mental state make feel like relationship work issue one like shit know hard deal mental breakdown go numb stop caring everything stop thinking mental energy much become devoid literally feeling people tell work still relationship supposed literally period time give fuck anything supposed put someone else ended multiple relationship mind tell time put misery self sabotage every single time would never want someone like think fair make people attempt either frustrates end earth people try convince still somebody else like work someone access therapy basically trying fix year absolutely nothing done ha worked anyone else job fix god forgive saving people last relationship meant like rant

Feelings of Guilt and Sadness When I See Something Cute or Heartwarming,"I experience this extremely bizarre feeling where every time I see something extremely cute, pure, adorable, or heartwarming (ex: anything about cute animals, a logo of an adorable cartoon alligator smiling and wearing a winter coat on an HVAC van, a bond between a dog and a human, a small family owned business like a bird bath store, really anything super cute and pure etc. ) I feel these intense feelings of guilt and sadness, like I want to cry. Almost like I feel guilty for not dedicating my life to it or done more for them. Why do adorable things trigger these feelings? 

I have tried to describe it and no one else has ever been able to relate. They look at me like I’m crazy. The only other person I know that experiences this is my sister.

I might be getting fired for struggling with depression.,"I’ve struggled really badly with depression and so many other things for years, I’ve gotten help off and on and it just never got better only just subsided for a bit. As of the last month or so it’s just became more than I can handle. I worked out in advance with my employers that I would be going into inpatient soon and they worked with me which was really nice of them. Once I came back I worked out a schedule I somewhat felt comfortable with, I worked the day I was scheduled earlier this week and tonight I was also scheduled. But the past two days I’ve been off I have been in such a rut, I can’t do anything, I can’t eat, I can’t drink anything, I can’t get up, I can’t communicate with anyone, I haven’t even been able to simply stand up in the shower the past few weeks, my motivation is just gone, I feel absolutely useless and helpless. The inpatient I went to helped so much while I was there and I just feel like everything broke and fell apart once I got back and I have no clue why, I felt so confident coming out that I could do it. I don’t know if it’s my new medications having bad effects or just me.  
So, early this morning I messaged my boss and said that I’ve been struggling and that I would do my best to be good for my evening shift. My other boss called me shortly after and talked with me about how if I can’t get ahold of my emotions then I will be let go. They mentioned that they can’t keep me if they never know when I’m working, which I completely understand, but that really hasn’t been happening. But I said that I would do my best to still work this evening, so I never said I couldn’t. I’ve been a loyal employee for almost 3 years at this one job and only recently have I ever needed accommodations for my mental health. This past month has been the only time I have ever called out, and I rarely even called out, today was really the only day. Otherwise I worked out beforehand or worked it out myself with other coworkers to take a shift. Even before I would take extra shifts and cover for someone if anyone ever called out on my days off, so it was easier for them. It’s just a really scary situation for me because my main stressor was work and now it’s even more of a stressor because I may not have a job to go to soon. I just really don’t know what to do because now I just have the stress of that and feeling of how I can’t even handle a simple job. I never realized that I could be fired for trying to get help/communicating with others on my ability to work. I don’t really know what to do about it because I’m doing all I can. All I do know is that if I don’t stop feeling the way I do, then I’m jobless. It’s even more difficult because the way I feel is completely out of my control, I don’t know when I’ll be okay or not okay, I just do what I can to make it better if it’s possible, but sometimes it’s just not possible. If anyone has any suggestions or helpful tips, it’d be great to hear. Not really sure what else to say in this post.

I feel like I have nothing left.,"I know I’m a very privileged person and very lucky to have what I have, but for the sake of this post, I’m about to wallow in self-pity and despair because my depression is truly blinding me of the good things in life right now.

I’m 31. I quit my job in January to (finally!) fulfill my dream of becoming a self-employed artist. All was well until March. It’s been a nightmare. I’ve lost so many clients. Missed every deadline. Disappointed many. I realized I hate making art as a job. But it was my dream for 20 years to be an artist. I’m now unemployed and completely lost as to what I should/want to do next.

My relationship of 3 years just ended. It was tough- we both suffer from mental illnesses and just couldn’t seem to break this cycle we had created. We had an 2 surprise pregnancies and 2 losses in the last 4 months. It was so f*cking bard but I was proud of us for getting through it together. It helped us grow closer for a little while and things were feeling better but now everything has completely fallen apart. Losing him also means losing my relationship with his son, who I love so much.

My “best” friend also dropped off the face of the earth around that time. Everything was completely fine with us and then one day she just stopped talking to me. It was a bit of a toxic friendship so I know it’s good that it ended but she was also the only person I could talk to about everything that was happening. She was the only one who listened and understood and was non-judgmental.

I can’t fly home to see my family for the holidays because of COVID. Since my partner and I just broke up, I guess that means I’m now completely alone for Christmas. 

To sum up, I literally feel like I’ve lost absolutely everything in the last few months. I have no idea what to do. I’m lucky to have a roof over my head and 3 sweet cats to cuddle but I can’t stop thinking of the fact that everything else I cared about or wanted is now....over.

I'm i weird?,"Alright, let me start off by saying i have no idea if i'm depresive, but it sure feels like it for the last 9 years..
Never went to a doctor to get diagnosed, so i problably have a ton of unknow mental disease.
I'm a very social person, in my hometown i can't go out without meeting at least 5 people i know, and i'm a jokester(unsure of the spelling here sorry)... but i kinda hide my pain because other people smiles make me somewhat happy for a brief time, and so i've been doing everything i can to be as funny and friendly as possible. Still, i feel this big void in me... like i wasn't meant to do anything of value...like i'm just some crutch for people.. all i ever do is try and get people happy and give them advice when they are sad... but i'm unable to do so, i couldn't possibly risk people feeling sad for me, because smiles are the only thing keeping me alive at the moment...
I also have a lot of trouble dealing with emotions when i'm alone, the other day i cried putting my socks on and i have no idea why, nothing bad happened in the days before... and women... oh god don't even make me start... i'm everyones best friend it seems... everytime its the same, they don't want to loose me being a ray of sunshine... i've never ever thought about suicide but.... recently... just seems like it wouldn't matter, i can be replaced... i feel sick just having this thought but... it's there and i don't know what to really do with all this.

I feel like something is wrong.,"I've been depressed for 3 years now and every year that pass, I feel worse than what I used to. I've lost interest in many things and motivation itself seems to quickly go away. 

I am a 16 year old and I was diagnosed with clinical depression at 13. I had aripiprazole and prodin (the doctor sometimes let me have this thing called fluoxitine) and I remembered feeling guilty of the support being given to me. I started being comfortable after a few weeks but after 3 months, I was shamed for it. My parents also stopped my medication without informing my doctor and I was left alone to feel this. My mother tells me that it is all in the mind and God will help me if I go to him. My father calls me an attention seeker and frames me for telling them this just to skip school. My sister tells me that I am also only seeking attention. 

My relationship with my family went downhill after that and I did what I can to mend the broken relationship that I have with my parents by not telling them anything at all. I am 16 now and I don't think I can handle myself anymore. My mother is bipolar and I cannot help why do the family support her while I the young one isn't? Is it because of the belief that it's normal for teens? We have been to 3 different psychiatrists and they still won't believe me? I just cannot help but just want to disappear and run away. School also isn't helping. I have work due next week but I just have no motivation at all to do anything. I just want to waste my life away. 

I also have so many memories flooding me; my teacher telling the whole class of depression when I think it should be private, my years of being bullied, my father's anger issues, my mother's pressure on me to keep on being a top student, and so many other things keeps going on my head. I just can't forgive my family but I just ended up feeling guilty so I can't really understand if I despise them or not. I think there is something wrong, but I'm afraid of telling anyone since many of the people I know are zealots and religious fanatics.

i don’t understand why i don’t kill myself,"I am a Christian but i don’t think there is anything beyond death - to me, after death there is absolutely nothing, so being dead is just utter peace and tranquillity because you cannot experience anything. This is something i want, so badly. This state of infinite non-existence sounds so much better than whatever i’m experiencing and have ever experienced, and especially right now seeing as all i feel is constant pain interspersed with brief moments of relief when i forget. ‘Life is a pre-death experience’. 

Yet, even though, rationally, i want to die more than anything, i still don’t kill myself, and i can’t understand why. 

There is absolutely no fear in me about heaven, hell or any sort of afterlife; there is no doubt in my mind that death is the be all and end all of everything, so that cannot be the reason i don’t do it. I know i don’t have indubitable knowledge about life after death, but then again, i feel like i know without a doubt what happens, so although it doesn’t mean that there is actually nothing after death, when i am considering this problem, that is how i see it, without any uncertainty. 

The pain of dying is also not something stopping me, to my knowledge. I don’t fear pain; in fact, i embrace it. Physical pain is a welcome break from the emotional turmoil i am constantly experiencing.

Rationally, i think i should kill myself. Death would be infinitely more desirable than anything happening to me now. So i don’t fucking understand why i don’t do it.

My ideal scenario is i develop a terminal disease, for example cancer or something similar, preferably quite painful, and i die in less than a month. This way it’s not my choice but i get to die quickly and my family won’t be sad that i committed suicide and they did nothing about it - you can’t stop
cancer. 

I just want life to end more than anything but there’s something stopping me from carrying it out and it just makes me hate myself more.

I wonder if there’s anyone else out there struggling with the same problem as me and would appreciate people’s thoughts on this.",2ezzzzzz,7,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxwp1s/i_dont_understand_why_i_dont_kill_myself/,christian think anything beyond death death absolutely nothing dead utter peace tranquillity cannot experience anything something want badly state infinite non existence sound much better whatever experiencing ever experienced especially right seeing feel constant pain interspersed brief moment relief forget life pre death experience yet even though rationally want die anything still kill understand absolutely fear heaven hell sort afterlife doubt mind death end everything cannot reason know indubitable knowledge life death feel like know without doubt happens although mean actually nothing death considering problem see without uncertainty pain dying also something stopping knowledge fear pain fact embrace physical pain welcome break emotional turmoil constantly experiencing rationally think kill death would infinitely desirable anything happening fucking understand ideal scenario develop terminal disease example cancer something similar preferably quite painful die le month way choice get die quickly family sad committed suicide nothing stop cancer want life end anything something stopping carrying make hate wonder anyone else struggling problem would appreciate people thought,understand kill,2 e zzz zzz,2078,42,2 e zzz zzz christian think anything beyond death death absolutely nothing dead utter peace tranquillity cannot experience anything something want badly state infinite non existence sound much better whatever experiencing ever experienced especially right seeing feel constant pain interspersed brief moment relief forget life pre death experience yet even though rationally want die anything still kill understand absolutely fear heaven hell sort afterlife doubt mind death end everything cannot reason know indubitable knowledge life death feel like know without doubt happens although mean actually nothing death considering problem see without uncertainty pain dying also something stopping knowledge fear pain fact embrace physical pain welcome break emotional turmoil constantly experiencing rationally think kill death would infinitely desirable anything happening fucking understand ideal scenario develop terminal disease example cancer something similar preferably quite painful die le month way choice get die quickly family sad committed suicide nothing stop cancer want life end anything something stopping carrying make hate wonder anyone else struggling problem would appreciate people thought understand kill

"Different opinion on ""Other people have it worse than you""","I was looking for a reddit thread with stories of other people who ""have it worse than me"" in hopes of minimalising my own problems and to see the bigger picture.

But I stumbled upon a thread with discussions about why that is not a healthy answer to give someone who is depressed, and I partially agree. Some comments were describing how they felt that other people were dismissing their feelings (meaning: deeming them unimportant), although, similarly I was looking to dismiss my own sad feelings (meaning: to send them away) because they don't serve me in any way, and I believe that it could actually be good advice to help put things in perspective. 

I can see why the advice can be easily misunderstood because a depressed person is in a different mind set than the person giving the advice (although they might be sincerely trying to help).",Monobuer,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy74s6/different_opinion_on_other_people_have_it_worse/,wa looking reddit thread story people worse hope minimalising problem see bigger picture stumbled upon thread discussion healthy answer give someone depressed partially agree comment describing felt people dismissing feeling meaning deeming unimportant although similarly wa looking dismiss sad feeling meaning send away serve way believe could actually good advice help put thing perspective see advice easily misunderstood depressed person different mind set person giving advice although might sincerely trying help,different opinion people worse,mono bu er,850,58,mono bu er wa looking reddit thread story people worse hope minimalising problem see bigger picture stumbled upon thread discussion healthy answer give someone depressed partially agree comment describing felt people dismissing feeling meaning deeming unimportant although similarly wa looking dismiss sad feeling meaning send away serve way believe could actually good advice help put thing perspective see advice easily misunderstood depressed person different mind set person giving advice although might sincerely trying help different opinion people worse
For those living with depression,"It’s gonna sound cliche but whatever your going through isn’t insurmountable. In all of us lives a child still afraid of the dark, and the monsters under our beds. But in us all also lives a hero not necessarily to the world or the benefit of others but to ourselves. Depression is a horrible thing and a painful way to live, but darkness can not exist in the complete absence of light. Now matter how hopeless times may feel, the only way it can feel that way is in contrast to the light you’ve once know or desire. I won’t begin to know your struggles or assume the situation you’re in, but I believe you’ll get better because I believe I will get better. What keeps me going is the fact that strength can only be created through hardship and humbling experiences. Would you throw out a lottery ticket before the numbers get called? Even when the odds seem insurmountable you need to find a way to keep hope. Time is wise and will guide your wisdom you just have to let it. Also I know a lot of people here like me, won’t care to hear this and will dismiss it because I’m the same way when people try to help me. It’s easier to assume they know nothing because it creates and excuse to stay sad. But whether it helps anyone or not, it’s posted with good intent and I hope all of you have improved quality of life.",whjool,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxyk4z/for_those_living_with_depression/,gonna sound cliche whatever going insurmountable u life child still afraid dark monster bed u also life hero necessarily world benefit others depression horrible thing painful way live darkness exist complete absence light matter hopeless time may feel way feel way contrast light know desire begin know struggle assume situation believe get better believe get better keep going fact strength created hardship humbling experience would throw lottery ticket number get called even odds seem insurmountable need find way keep hope time wise guide wisdom let also know lot people like care hear dismiss way people try help easier assume know nothing creates excuse stay sad whether help anyone posted good intent hope improved quality life,living depression,wh joo l,1315,32,wh joo l gonna sound cliche whatever going insurmountable u life child still afraid dark monster bed u also life hero necessarily world benefit others depression horrible thing painful way live darkness exist complete absence light matter hopeless time may feel way feel way contrast light know desire begin know struggle assume situation believe get better believe get better keep going fact strength created hardship humbling experience would throw lottery ticket number get called even odds seem insurmountable need find way keep hope time wise guide wisdom let also know lot people like care hear dismiss way people try help easier assume know nothing creates excuse stay sad whether help anyone posted good intent hope improved quality life living depression

"before covid I had happiness, now I'm convinced I want to die","This is a long one so if you stick around, cheers. it was my senior year of high school, I remember all of my hard work paying off and finally becoming captain of powerlifting,  I made it to the state championship.  I finally got things under control with my dad, we felt like we loved each other again. I had a beautiful girlfriend along with amazing friends who've always been there for me. Even a 4.0 GPA and several scholarships that would get me through college. However, it all changed in March when quarantine began and my state championship powerlifting meet was canceled, along with baseball. When I found out prom was canceled too, I was extremely discouraged, all my hard work in sports just to get it all thrown away during my SENIOR year of high school. I shook it off, after all I still had great physique, a girlfriend of 1 year, amazing friends, and a newfound relationship with my father. It was only the beginning of disaster. About a month into quarantine and online classes, my grades slipped and my dad lost his mind, we got in a physical fight which resulted in me getting kicked out of the house. I've be scarred ever since. Depression and anxiety haunted me and i struggled in online classes, which led to even worse grades and losing scholarships. The gym closed shortly after which was one of the final blows to my morale because working out was my way of blowing steam and keeping my mind sane. It spiraled out of control from here. I graduated without any ceremony or pictures or dinner or congrats, just a mail in diploma. During summer I found out i wouldn't be going on my senior trip with the boys because of covid, we planned the trip for 3 years. On top of that my girlfriend and I fought everyday for about four weeks, we broke up right before college started. Horribly out of shape, single, short on scholarships, and mind-fucked, i started college. Immediately I collapsed and couldn't maintain even a 2.5 gpa, the stress of the world was breaking me. Luckily my roommate was an avid pothead, so in order to reduce stress we smoked weed everyday. This made things worse. I gained so much weight that i don't even recognize myself, I slept in so much i missed all my classes, talk to zero females, and I have barely any friends. Now its November 2020, I hate myself and my only wish is for things to go back before covid, when i was happy. I know this wish will never become true, and i know there are so many problems in my life that can't be fixed. So ive decided that whats the point of living if every good thing that happens gets taken away, whats the point if I can't go back. I want to die, ive never wanted to die more in my life than i do now, i give up. My grades are so bad that I'm guaranteed not to go back to college. It can't get any worse than this and it is for sure not going to get any better, so i think I'm ready to give up. I've hit rock bottom and its not even my fault, its not that i wanna be happy its that i wanna escape the unending pain, so i feel like the best solution is suicide, which I'm strongly leading towards to right now.

Depressed and axious about everything in my life. Help!,"Hello there😔,

I just want to get everything out of my heart. I always feel depressed about my situation. I am a poor 18 year old living with one mother in a poor country. My only strength is education, I got a scholarship in the best university in my country and I expect to be graduating in 2022. However, when I overthink about my future, my purpose, and my passion, I think like I am lying to myself. My main motivation is to get out, me and my family, from poverty. But then, I realise that education cannot do so. I then lose motivation, and my grades starts to decrease. I am not always depressed about this situation, but from time to time for 3 years. 

I am so lost about my purpose in life. I don't want to be that normal person that lives every day by itself (like many of my friends do), but I want to be someone with a purpose. I just lose motivation when I remember that I am nothing than a poor kid from a poor country that can't do anything but stay in poverty. I just feel that there are no reasons to continue. I feel the lack of oppurtunities. I just feel success corruption (because of my surroundings). Everybody talks to me for a reason or for s favor, and when I try to discuss this matter with anyone, i can't hear but their laughs hitting the sky about my thoughts.

Advice for a depressed artist,"Does anyone have any advice on how to get back into doing what you love when depression just makes it feel like pulling teeth? I’ve tried setting little goals for myself and patting myself on the back for accomplishing them, but I just don’t feel motivated to do anything anymore. I don’t want to work, exercise, draw, make food, talk to anyone, or learn anything new. I wanted to learn the guitar for years, and now strumming it, which once felt so rich and warm when it reverberated through my chest, feels empty. And every time I pick up a pen and start to draw, I quit halfway through and I never finish anything. It just feels like I’m letting myself down. And I’m the “artist” to all of my friends, family, and co-workers, so it always comes up in conversations and I have to tell them, “I haven’t finished a drawing in probably over a year.” I’m trying to do this for myself, not them, but I can’t help but feel like I’m letting everyone down.

Am I depressed or overreacting?,"Hi all,

A little bit of background info. I'm a 14 yr old Asian girl, a freshman in high school. Recently, I've been wondering if I'm experiencing symptoms of depression or just going through a normal teenage phase.

Lately, I've noticed that I've been more sad than happy, mainly because of my parents. Don't get me wrong they're not abusive or anything, but I feel a lot of pressure in everything I do. They take away my phone if I have a B (once my grade drops), I spend the weekends doing SAT and stupid ass math worksheets, and I have 45 minutes all my phone all day and they can monitor my computer activity at all times. That being said, we've had a pretty rocky relationship lately, and I've gotten the feeling that a. I'll never live up to their standards and b. I'm kind of a disappointment. Outside of school, my parents constantly tell me I'm doing this wrong and that wrong at my sports practices, which kind of irks me because they've never even played the sport. I feel like this combination of things has driven me to the edge. They also view everything I do as a micro-aggression? I'll close my door a tiny bit too loud and they'll immediately talk about disrespect and my attitude.

Anyway, I've gotten in this state of sadness over the past couple of days. I've experienced some suicidal thoughts, but deep down I know I'm too cowardly to ever harm myself. I cry constantly, and honestly I can't find a source of happiness that's constant in my life right now. That being said, I also think I might just be an angsty teenager. I'd love to hear anyone's opinion on this.

I lasted less than a month at university,"I feel like a complete failure 


I’m currently in the process of moving back in with my parents, and I feel utterly hopeless and ashamed over the way I handled things. This was my first and last chance at improving my life and I fucked it up. My parents are encouraging me to try again next year, but I know I’ll just fuck it up again. 


I often think about whether I was ever supposed to make it this far. Maybe all the times I came close to ending it were the correct choice, and now I’m experiencing the consequences. I hate having to rely on others but I’m too pathetic to help myself. 


I’m exactly where I was in life before I was was sectioned, and I know I’m going to relapse soon. I’m going to crash and burn and drag everyone down with me. Then I’m going to convince myself that I have another chance, then I’ll fuck that up and repeat the cycle.

 Like everyone, this year has been a nightmare for my mental health (I have Depression,  anxiety,  PTSD and BLP). These last few months have been a whole new level. Lost my girlfriend due to my mental health and her saying she doesn't want it in her life,  my car died on me, lost my job due to a combination of all these factors, got in to a argument with my therapist and fired her and broke my wrist and of course lost my health insurance. I am lost and scared, I don't have a next move and longer I wait more frozen from it all I become. I know this is all doing and no one to blame but myself....but I just don't know what to do anymore.

Just need to vent a while,"I'm a 29 years old trans woman living in Brazil. 

I'm diagnosed with depression and right now I probably take more drugs than my grandmother, I'm on Lithium and some other stuff, 8 pills a day and when I have insomnia I take 14.

I started very young at school, with 3 years old, went to law school at 16, finished it at 21 and passed in the bar with 21.

Since then I work as a lawyer. When I transitioned at 27 years old the office I used to work had to close and since then I never got a single interview, there was a occasion where a company HR called and asked for my name, when I said it was me and they heard my voice they just hung up.

With 28 years old I tried suicide and went hospitalized. 

Transitioning made me feel happier about myself and honestly, aside the voice I pass quite well, I'll probably will never be satisfied about how I am, but I pass most of the time. 

My income, however, dropped a lot, I don't have a steady income as before and I'm on over 95k of debt.

I didn't know that this could trigger me,I spent two weeks with a friend who has been having a hard time. She herself was depressives and that depressive energy drained me and triggered me. It brought back my own feelings of depression and lack which I've fought very hard to overcome. I genuinely cannot help her because if I do it'll leave me depressed. I'm very well empathetic and even sympathetic and I cry and internalize all that sadness and pain long after the person I'm around is gone. I wanna help but then I'll be left feeling helpless because it'll seem as if I can't help myself let alone other people. I genuinely do not have a full cup. I genuinely do have an empty cup and so with all the kindness I can muster up for myself I have to realize that and just say no. Not out of selfishness but self preservation. I genuinely have triggers for my own depression. And it's really important that I maintain an energy that allows me to grow past and stave off those triggers because if I don't I'll easily go back to suicidal thoughts and feelings of worthlessness,givagx,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy6chi/i_didnt_know_that_this_could_trigger_me/,spent two week friend ha hard time wa depressive depressive energy drained triggered brought back feeling depression lack fought hard overcome genuinely cannot help leave depressed well empathetic even sympathetic cry internalize sadness pain long person around gone wanna help left feeling helpless seem help let alone people genuinely full cup genuinely empty cup kindness muster realize say selfishness self preservation genuinely trigger depression really important maintain energy allows grow past stave trigger easily go back suicidal thought feeling worthlessness,know could trigger,giv gx,1034,40,giv gx spent two week friend ha hard time wa depressive depressive energy drained triggered brought back feeling depression lack fought hard overcome genuinely cannot help leave depressed well empathetic even sympathetic cry internalize sadness pain long person around gone wanna help left feeling helpless seem help let alone people genuinely full cup genuinely empty cup kindness muster realize say selfishness self preservation genuinely trigger depression really important maintain energy allows grow past stave trigger easily go back suicidal thought feeling worthlessness know could trigger
I posted this on another subreddit but I’m posting it on this one because I’m an attention whore. Just because i can recognise that I’m being an attention whore doesn’t mean it’s ok to be one but oh wellllllll,"I hate myself and I’m so lonely and I beg for attention even though I don’t deserve it and I make an embarrassment out of myself and also I’m a selfish idiot who only cares about himself yayyayayyaysyy also my life isn’t that bad I shouldn’t make such a big deal out of it but really my life isn’t that bad I pity myself too much and I enjoy being sad and I look terrible and I’m balding at 17 and no one likes me and my life isn’t that bad at all so there isn’t really a point to complain I just want someone to love me and I push people away and no one cares about me and I’m fucking ugly. I’m so lazy instead of actually helping myself I just jack myself off from how “depressed” I am. You’re not depressed you’re a fucking dickhead that doesn’t care at all about your mum or dad or how they feel, not everything is about you. You say you don’t want attention but by attempting to cover up stuff to people you’re only drawing more attention to yourself which you actually like because you’re so pathetic. Instead of wallowing how bout you actually get some work done and don’t fuck up your life. You don’t actually need to do much in order to succeed why can’t you do it. You’re so fucking spoilt that you can’t take even the slightest amount of adversity. You just stay in your room all day feeling sad, and you’re not even sad that much you’re just sad that you’re losing your hair what a big deal that is I’m sure that’ll affect your life so much I can guarantee. Except being bald makes me sad and insecure get the fuck over it you dumb cunt. The only reason you’re posting this on reddit is because you’re begging for attention from anyone. That isn’t even true your mum cares about you and gives you attention but you push her away for no reason. It’s not like your family hates you so don’t act like no one cares about you selfish asshole. You don’t need to let everyone know that you’re sad, everyone’s sad get over it. Your friend is a lot worse than you and she doesn’t let literally everyone know how sad she is.  No ones gonna read this anyways because other people aren’t responsible for dealing with your problems. Everyone has problems. Loads of people don’t have friends, your siblings don’t have friends. What makes you so special. You don’t even try to improve yourself. You don’t exercise you don’t work you don’t do anything remotely productive you just get high off Ritalin and play melee all day. You want to tell people you cut yourself today but only for attention you don’t actually want to get help you want someone else to deal with it for you because you can’t function alone and also you only cut yourself today it’s not a chronic problem get over it. You fantasise of telling emotionally unstable people how much you’ve improved as a person just so you can have sex with them, because you like that power dynamic for some fucked up reason. Don’t be under the illusion that anyone will read this, don’t pity yourself for saying that either because that’s what you want for people to feel sorry for you because of how pathetic you are. Have some fucking dignity. You’re still going to post it anyways because you’re an attention whore, not because I’m lonely, but because i push away the people that actually want to help me and treat them like shit. You appear to people that you’re the victim but you’re not. You’re a manipulative little shit, but actually I don’t hate myself that much, I’m just overblowing it so people will pay attention to me. Sure you may hate yourself now for shaving off all your hair, but is that really self hatred. No I don’t think so. But you think to yourself I must be a broken person because you’re writing this long rant on reddit. Not really it’s just because you’re not willing to invest your time into anything productive with your Ritalin. You just get high and rant for attention. You’re so fucking narcissistic, when I’m looking back on the things I wrote “no I don’t think so” what a fucking asshole.

Covid isolation (and depression?),"I haven't gotten anything done for several months. Not in my studies, not in my work, not in any life outside of these. Most days I spend laying on the bed, knowing what I should do, but somehow I reason that I can postpone these things. Nevertheless, the lingering feeling of work left undone brings further fatigue, despite me not working and just laying on the bed.

I feel like a disappointment, although I wasn't always like this. Since the Spring, I've been more or less isolated alone in my tiny one bedroom apartment. In this time, my fatigue has grown, seemingly without good reason, since I haven't worked or studied all that much. This feeling of not accomplishing anything adds on to my disappointment in myself. I'm in my early-to-mid twenties pursuing a master's degree, and every second that I postpone working on my studies, I risk postponing my graduation by six months (I have to accomplish a certain amount of study credits by January, the deficit caused by unproductivity in the Spring). Despite of this I can rarely get anything done until a deadline looms dangerously close, even then I have began to miss them, where as before I'd still be able to get things done. I have a left courses unfinished, which further aids in adding to my depression(?). 

Worst part of this is, is that this is no-ones fault but mine. I'm the one who should study, I'm the one who should work, I've been able to do these things before. I haven't discussed these feelings with anyone in my life, not because they wouldn't care, but because I don't want to change their view of me. I feel alone. I am alone. On the rare occasion I do meet people (friends/family), I pretend that all is well.

Considering checking myself into treatment. What does that involve?,"Long story short, that I'm sure many of us are familiar with - my depression, anxiety, and loneliness are spiraling to the point where my life is completely un-liveable at this point. The ""suicidal ideation"" is steadily but surely creeping into ""let's plan out how we're going to do this."" 

I need help. I feel like I need to get out of my environment and go get treated somewhere, even if it's ""the looney bin."" 

So my question is, for those that have experienced this, would you recommend it? My first obstacle is money; if there's any cost to this thing then the option is out. I have negative money. But I'm also worried about a stint in a mental hospital having shockwaves throughout my life - probably losing my job, scaring the shit out of my family, and being made to feel like a crazy person.

The pandemic depression just hit again,"I’m literally just rambling because I don’t like discussing depressing stuff with my friends, so I have no one to talk to about it I guess. Anyway this pandemic depression hits different. It’s like depression with mental exhaustion subbed for the suicidal thoughts. I graduated and watched all my life and career plans crumble before me due completely to Miss Corona, so I’ve spent the rest of the time since March just being in an awful place mentally and physically and it’s just gotten so much worse lately; for once I’m starting to completely give into the depression no resistance and it scares me for real. It’s really hard to find the motivation to start treating myself well again and going after my goals, my brain is fighting me every step of the way, it feels like someone dropped it in acid it’s useless.

It’s been a while. I lost a friend,I met him in high school where I struggled to fit in and find a place. It was him and two others. They introduced me to drinking and laughing. I hadn’t smiled in so long and them just being there made it worth it. He is the center of so many good memories. And he committed suicide last night. He lost his battle. And I had no idea. He grew distant as we did all. I wish I was there for him like he was for me: I know what that darkness feels like. I wish I could have been there to just say it was gonna be okay.

My life has never been easy but lately I feel like nothing matters. I care about nothing want to do nothing dont invest time or love into anything or anyone. And this happened even before my dad passed. So indont think its exclusively the loss.

I like to dedicate my weekends to drinking. I don't know do i have a problem with alcohol, but i must at least twice or once a week to get really drunk. 

I like to feel sorry for myself. I like to think that i'm this dramatic fictional character who appears in tv shows or in movies to whom the past haunts and the life feels like the series of failure. I like to imagine myself in a music video with a very sad song, showing my life's baddest moments. 

I keep playing Sims to get distracted from my thoughts. I constantly buy new expansions to fill the emptiness i have inside me.

I don't think people think it through when asking you to reach out.,"You know how people say you can reach out to me or talk to me? I don't think most of them know what they should be expecting when someone actually reaches out.

I believe that they think the person just needs someone to casually talk to or hang out with in that moment, but I think that is far from the truth.

It's just... i can see you're dodging the stuff i want to talk about when I reached out to them as they said. Which is why I then get cynical when someone says you can talk to me.

I (19F) feel like I’m becoming a baby (the complete opposite of becoming an adult),"The school I worked at had a COVID case so I have to stay in my room so I don’t pass it to my parents. My biggest fear is something bad happening to them. 

Now that I have been stuck in my room for 2 days, I am starting to feel even worse than before. I get strong urges to end my life and then everything goes numb. I cry a lot and I can’t stop it. If I have to work on something remotely difficult, I will start panicking and crying. And I need constant validation and comfort. I had started sleeping beside my mom and sometimes my little sister because I couldn’t sleep alone without crying. I take everything personally. I get hurt really easily.

And on top of everything I am taking a gap year because the program I was in started this mess. And I got into a messy relationship because I was willing to anything he wanted so he wouldn’t leave me. It wasn’t his fault. Because I’m now realizing that I am becoming an empty shell of a person. I am so scared of being alone and I can’t function without being around someone. I have become needy and depressed. 

I don’t want to live like this. I KNOW that I’ll wake up tomorrow and do some exercises in my room and be ‘productive’ but it will all spiral down again. I really truly hate myself beyond belief.

"Why, life?","Every morning, I reluctantly shuffle out of bed to my mum screaming at me to wake up. Depending on if it’s the weekend or not, I will either arrive 30 mins late for school, or stay home and do nothing with my life all day. I feel guilty for even thinking about trying to get better, trying to move forward in life. I hold so much guilt and shame from times in my life when I was a selfish asshole, labels and marks I can never shake off. 

Oh and by the way, I am really really fat, I am 5’6 and weigh 94kg, from when I used to eat junk food and never exercise because I thought I couldn’t because of severe clubfoot in both of my feet that was treated very badly by doctors when I was a kid, where I couldn’t run or do physical activity for even a moderate amount of time, lest I risk excruciating pain for the rest of the day. But it wasn’t because of that, I’m just pathetic, no goals and aspirations in life, constantly paranoid and anxious about the future.

I play the guitar I suppose, a few other instruments too. But for a while now, the fun has been sucked out of that as well. My dad constantly pressuring me to play for his sake, as well as not having anything to play on guitar anymore, basically ruined that for me. I still play it, but it’s no longer fun to learn a song I heard once that sounded cool.

I know I am a toxic, shitty person. I don’t deserve to be around others, I would only ever scare them away with my bullshit. I deeply messed up my relationship with a girl I loved very much, that was three years ago and I’m still not over it. I feel unimaginable guilt and shame for ruining the relationship by coming on too strongly and not controlling my tendency to cry and isolate myself whenever we get into arguments. I don’t trust myself with a relationship after that one, history will repeat itself yet again, I just know it.

My relationship with my parents isn’t really ruined yet, but it’s getting there. I know they’re trying their best. They constantly ask me “what’s wrong?”, and “what are you feeling right now?”. But I don’t think they understand just how unexplainable depression can be.
They seem to think of it as just ‘being sad’. It’s so so much more than that.

I’m 16 years old and I don’t even want to know what I want to study in uni, hell, I don’t even know if I can go in the state I am right now. I had dreams and aspirations during young naïve parts of my live, where I actually felt happy, because I wasn’t overthinking my future. But those dreams and aspirations have been lost in the sands of time. 

Everyone in my classes at school seems to have the whole world in the palm of their hand. Everyone is over confident, smiling, being with friends, knowing that their future is going to be just great. I had friends, until I pushed them away for what, for me to be alone for a while?? What a selfish, nasty bastard I must be.

Nothing gives me emotions anymore. I can no longer feel joy, anger, disgust, surprise. I have one mood, and that is a blank, melancholic mood, that is colder than any ice or cold thing you will ever touch.

I think back to some bad things I did in my youth, and constantly ruminate over the worst case scenario of what could happen to me. Then I believe that that worse case scenario will actually happen irl. It seems that the true enemy in my body is my own mind and imagination.

I’ve been having very scary delusions and paranoia recently. Like for example, i’m scared of being watched by my school through my webcam on my school pc, i’m afraid of people looking through my window while I sleep, I’m afraid that, while sleeping, someone will come into our house and steal our stuff or worse, harm us. I’m afraid of being arrested, even if I did nothing wrong. I’m afraid that I have unknowingly installed a virus on my pc, so that a criminal can track my keystrokes and find out personal information, passwords, and my card number. Why do I care so much about all this? I thought i hated my life!

So why, life? Why am I here, when the only purpose I serve in life is making sure I don’t do something drastic like kill myself because “my family would be sad” or whatever. Because there’s not much reason to live if all I do is just float through life, not making anything of myself.

In fact, that’s the only reason why I stay on this mortal coil day in day out, is because I’m too much of a pussy to see what death will be like. I feel stuck between these two worlds, a purgatory, and I can’t get to neither of them. 

I’ve hurt too much, and I’m afraid of what my future will look like. I’ve apologised, but I still feel the chains of guilt weighing me down from trying to live a good life.",Coopmel04,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy2i68/why_life/,every morning

Divorce: the worst thing you can do to your kids,"This text started out as a song but quickly turned out in just me expressing:(, its directed to my parents. I doubt they ever see it, but at least reddit will

&amp;#x200B;

They always told me

Music is the expression of your feelings

Of your emotions

&amp;#x200B;

Thats why a lot of people sing about love, happiness 

About their passed ones, killed brother, sister’s suicide

Money, drugs and girls aren’t lyrics 

Its fake inspiration when they tryna look good

&amp;#x200B;

Mine’s a little more complicated

Its my family falling a part

My sister falling apart

Myself falling a part

&amp;#x200B;

Living nomad, they said it was a life style?

Having no sedentary place, you guys really like that?

&amp;#x200B;

Coming home to negative attitude

Gotta be king of the place cuz the others are falling apart

Having to be there for them cuz they need it

Having to act as the man cuz they can’t live without one

Having to make yourself look happy cuz people can’t deal with bad emotions

&amp;#x200B;

Tryna put it down low

Living with no where to go

Putty on a fake smile

Giving advice to people without knowing your the one needing it

&amp;#x200B;

If only that day never came

Separation man, fuck that

Its the worst thing a family can do

Kids having parents loving somebody else

What the fuck is even that

&amp;#x200B;

You guys were supposed to be my ideal

I was suppose to have you as my love story goal

but you erased it

&amp;#x200B;

Images fade, is love even real

Im in a forever ending love that won’t ever workout

Cuz I saw it in my parents

&amp;#x200B;

The image that I had, gone in 2 weeks

Yeah cuz we see it coming,

Tryna hide it but the day you start sleeping in different beds

Everything becomes clear

The water isn’t flowing anymore

The roses, brown dead

&amp;#x200B;

If only I had the money to go alone

To live on my own

To hide from this constant pain going on in front of me

I just want to put it to the side and call it a day

Put you guys are always there to remind me of it

&amp;#x200B;

I just want to go far away

Away from here, away from you

I just want to live on my own

Not having to see you

No reminder of the ending love story of my life

&amp;#x200B;

Dude do you even realize that

The love story that made me come to life

The attraction that had taken place for me to be born

It was strong enough and willing full so that two kids could be born

&amp;#x200B;

And in a instant pouff

Explodes

And i can’t even say a word

&amp;#x200B;

The happiness that was there during all my life

Pouff gone

Now its just constant reminder

&amp;#x200B;

Been living nomad for two years

Always getting shitted on for the stupidest things cuz they can’t deal with their own emotions

And they let em flowing to us thinking that their acting as parents teaching us

But what they’re really giving us

Is the hate growing slowly and slowly deep inside

&amp;#x200B;

They're  just reminding us that they failed 

Every fkin day

every single stupidest skin day

I just want to get out of here

And not see them

Taking a break 

&amp;#x200B;

If I had the money

Id already be gone

Im saying all this to a page

But damn it feels good

&amp;#x200B;

I was so into them that i cannot survive without them. I had the most painful heartache. I couldn’t even move from the pain. It still hurts but the pain is dull now. I have no reason to live and my mind is killing me. I’ve been diagnosed with depression years ago and i’m on medications. I have a lot of them yet nothing is helping me. Depression keeps relapsing, i did everything to stop it. Ive been on recovery since late 2019 and now it hit again. I lost all my recovery process and my deepest fear was to get depressed again. It’s always my mind. It makes it far worse. I keep getting suicidal thoughts and i have intent of killing myself, its just seem the only way to stop myself from thinking. Literally, during my depression episodes all i think is of harming myself. I used to self harm but now im clean. I can’t stop thinking of harming and killing myself. I’ve always thought of falling down the stairs or stabbing myself. I can’t stop thinking about all these things. I have planned many times to do it. And i also have attempted to kill myself last year but i was sent to the ER. It was a tough experience but i still can’t stop thinking of ending my life.

I want to crawl in a hole and die,Yesterday I smoked weed for the first time in a long time. I had a horrible reaction to it and had to go to the emergency room. I called my ex gf (we broke up like 2 weeks ago) while high and begged her to take me back. She told me to wait until the next day and see what I felt like when I wasn't high. When I woke up today I still felt the same. I sent her a very sweet and well thought out text asking her to take me back and she said no. That made me feel horrible. I was willing to forget all the bad stuff she did that made me break up with her but she said I hurt her too much by breaking up with her. She said she still loves and misses me but she can't be with me. I wanted to hang up and cry but she convinced me not to. Then she lied to me about drinking tonight because I could tell she was kinda drunk. Lying was one of the main reasons I broke up with her. I feel as though I have been stabbed through the heart. I'm so heartbroken and lonely. She was my only friend. Now I just want to die. I've been considering driving my car off a bridge. I need help.

The last decade of my life has been full of ups and downs... Can't seem to kick this depression.,"Forgive me for any mistakes as I am on mobile. I've been depressed since right around the start of 2010. I used to drink heavy but stopped since my wife became pregnant with our first. I've become really good with faking a smile as I'm sure most of you are familiar with. I'm nearly 30 now and wondering will this ever end? I've been to doctors, I'm medicated but nothing helps. I have some good days but the majority of them are shit. I know what sparked my depression but there's no changing that. I feel like a total POS because I have a wife and kids, you know, the ""american dream"" but here I am. I struggle with chronic pain as well from an illness that has no cure. I have no one to vent with because they either don't get it or just tell me to smoke weed when I actually do open up on that rare occasion. It's gotten to the point now where I pretty much shut all my friends out of my life and I only see my family. Sorry for my rant and my apologies if this seems like a bunch of rambling.

I am on the brink of losing everything.,"First, about 6 months ago my 5 year long term relationship ended, mutually actually. It was around when COVID first hit too so I couldn't get my mind off of it by going to the gym or going out to restaurants to help pass the time anymore. I'm 30 but I'm a student and I will graduate next semester with a degree in Networking. Well, I just found out that I'm likely losing my IT job too due to the company being bought out in the coming weeks. Not only that but my program requires an internship in order to graduate and I intended on using my current position. Regardless of what happens with that though, I was told that if I lost my job due to an event out of my control then they'd just assign a project instead. Anyway, so I lost the beautiful love of my life and her sweet daughter, now I'm losing my job, and next could be my savings and my house if I can't find new employment quickly.

Are you ever paranoid that your coping mechanisms will become harmful addictions?,"I sound dumb and pretentious but for some reason I feel like its important for me to have this grand purpose and joy in life instead of just being content with fleeting pleasures.

You  know that feeling, that feeling that everything is right. Wherever you  look around you, it feels right, from the people you're with to the  drink in your hand. Fuck, even the bench you're sitting on or the  position of the sun in the sky feels right. And you know that it's the  best feeling cause at the exact same moment you realize it's here it's  gone, leaving you with a stupid smile and loads of love to give.

I  remember my firsts times with this feeling, getting to know it, to  embrace it, to chase it. I tried to live only for it and to fill my life  with it. I've tried so hard that I've lost it. And now I'm left with  the exact opposed feeling. Everything feels ugly, everything's mugging  me, everything hurts. And it lasts, oh my god it lasts, this shit never  ends.

Sometimes I spend hours in  the same place, not knowing what to do because whatever I project myself  into feels wrong, and I stay there, trying not to think, because I'm  sick and tired of thinking, I know this to well, I've been thinking for  too long, and it always leads me into the same fucking wall.

It feels like it's been a long time since this shit directly affected me.,"Even though it's probably only been like two weeks. To be completely honest, what I need is a change of pace, a change of scenery, and a change of people, which I feel like I'm finally getting. This election taught me that nowhere is safe, nowhere is better, and chances are where you are, and what you've built yourself is worth holding onto, no matter how self destructive it may seem at times.

I couldn't have made it this far without that spite, for every one of them, and most others. I made it into a position of relative skill, compared to the crap jobs I used to work. To those of you who think I don't deserve it, I know you'd rather me be dead in the ground than impacting society in any productive way, and your opinion is invalid to me.

I might as well express this spite here on the internet, where nobody will associate it with myself. Idk, I'm bored. Can't sleep. Friends accomplishing things along with me, in other aspects of life.

My grandma passed but I don’t feel sorrow,"So yesterday my grandma passed, presumably from Covid since she tested positive last week. I only found out from my aunt messaging me, my dad didn’t even bother leaving a note about it. She asked how I felt about it but I didn’t answer it since... I dont really feel anything.

My grandma suffered a stroke years ago and she lost use of her left limbs. So, that way of living was a huge struggle as you could imagine. She was lonely and depressed. No one should have to live through that Hell. I think what happened was, well, a relief in someway for her.

The last time I talked to her was over 2 years ago. I felt uncomfortable around her in that state. I can’t even remember any fond memories with her as a kid.

I’m expecting to feel quite uncomfortable at the funeral because of my lack of emotions. Everyone else in the family is going to be mourning and *together*. I’m always the *black sheep*, whether it’s family, friends, school, work, or society. I feel like I dont have any sort of family bonds with anyone. And I can only ever cry for myself now, which I hate.

——

This week a coworker took the week off since his grandma also passed. Because he’s popular, they were passing around a card for people to sign. I didn’t sign it since I don’t want to be disingenuous or fake in pretending that I care.

Mr Popular is the complete opposite of me. He’s an outgoing, attractive family man who has the support and respect of friends and coworkers; He probably even has basic human emotions like grief over the loss of a family member, imagine that.",towerllama,5,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy146y/my_grandma_passed_but_i_dont_feel_sorrow/,yesterday grandma passed presumably covid since tested positive last week found aunt messaging dad even bother leaving note asked felt answer since dont really feel anything grandma suffered stroke year ago lost use left limb way living wa huge struggle could imagine wa lonely depressed one live hell think happened wa well relief someway last time talked wa 2 year ago felt uncomfortable around state even remember fond memory kid expecting feel quite uncomfortable funeral lack emotion everyone else family going mourning together always black sheep whether family friend school work society feel like dont sort family bond anyone ever cry hate week coworker took week since grandma also passed popular passing around card people sign sign since want disingenuous fake pretending care mr popular complete opposite outgoing attractive family man ha support respect friend coworkers probably even ha basic human emotion like grief loss family member imagine,grandma passed feel sorrow,tower llama,1556,41,tower llama yesterday grandma passed presumably covid since tested positive last week found aunt messaging dad even bother leaving note asked felt answer since dont really feel anything grandma suffered stroke year ago lost use left limb way living wa huge struggle could imagine wa lonely depressed one live hell think happened wa well relief someway last time talked wa 2 year ago felt uncomfortable around state even remember fond memory kid expecting feel quite uncomfortable funeral lack emotion everyone else family going mourning together always black sheep whether family friend school work society feel like dont sort family bond anyone ever cry hate week coworker took week since grandma also passed popular passing around card people sign sign since want disingenuous fake pretending care mr popular complete opposite outgoing attractive family man ha support respect friend coworkers probably even ha basic human emotion like grief loss family member imagine grandma passed feel sorrow
"Repetition and Inevitability, Failure to Socialize, Unable to Find Contentment","The last several years have been miserable. Since I was a just a kid, my life was miserable enough to want me to idealize suicide. I have managed to - at the very least - exist up until today because I have not yet been pushed over the edge. Overcoming this depression doesn’t seem attainable... Day after day, and ai sincerely cannot recall what happiness is. I have managed to find moments of peace, but those moments fade much too quick and lead to more hurtful future feelings. Setting goals and trying to achieve them is silly. I want to socialize. Make friends. Have lovers. Encounter people - even a chat with a stranger would be great. These are not achievable. I am unsure as to why. Maybe I’m overconfident. I find myself handsome and interesting in many aspects. Perhaps my mental illness is too visible in my face. I don’t know, and I hate knowing that people would never tell me. Criticism and development doesn’t exist for me. Especially in this year, people prefer to avoid interactions and confrontation; they often just block or ignore others on social media. I believe socialization is fundamental to human life, and without it, there can’t be happiness. Even so, I tried to isolate myself (without being a shut-in). I focused on what I can do solely by myself. I have studied programming, arts like modeling and drawing, language, etc. I tried to workout because supposedly fitness is just so damn important. There’s no joy there...

I always go back to wanting to meet someone. I want a friend - a real one. It seems it will never happen. I will never know why. I am willing to change myself, but no one will tell me if my behavior is wrong. No one will tell me if it’s the way I look. It’s the way I exist. I’m so avoidable, no one even sends hate my way. Learning isn’t even an option. 

I am immensely confused. I have never once seen a real explanation for this. It is as though I am nothing more than a displeasure to be near. This being the internet that I am posting on - and with the assumption that even a single person would read this post - I expect people to reply with ignorant advice. Whatever is said, I have tried focusing on hobbies, engaging with community activities, approaching people, inviting people, ignoring people, focusing on myself, etc. etc. I just want to vent. It’s frustrating to hear the same nonsense over and over that cannot be applicable. 

I contacted a past coworker on Instagram about her post. It was a foolish one that was very anti-safety precautions related to Covid-19. I hate these people, but I am desperate for interaction. I replied with an agreement, and I tried to further the conversation by discussing the negatives and benefits of their ideas. Blocked. I tried to ask about someone’s birthday. Ignored. Guessed at the birthday when the day came. Ignored. Let some days past as to not be overdramatic. I understand miscommunications happen. Perhaps the phone was unavailable. Tried again. Message read. Ignored. Waited... decided to ask why I was ignored. Apologized. Left. This was a person that invited me out the last time we spoke. It seems it was a tease. As it typical in my experience. My hopes getting dashed are part of the experience, I suppose. 

I can’t believe this is an issue. It’s happened to me too many times from too many people. There’s something wrong with me, right? I fool myself into knowing that there’s something wrong with the world, but I must just be repulsive.

Anyhow, that is all. Thanks for taking a peek.

Feeling lonely as I’ve ever been. I feel like I can’t really relate to anyone. No friends in the same city and generally mentally unwell 😣,"So life seems to be kicking my ass lately. I’ve been depressed for like years now but it seems this year has been particularly bad so maybe my depression is amplified. To start off I’ve been in a relationship for 8 years now and it’s coming to a bitter end(we’ve stopped talking to each other pretty much about a month ago but we still live together-will likely still live together until the lease is up so another year). I feel we both knew it was coming because it’s been far from perfect and I genuinely wanted to help him grow and not be stuck in the rut he’s been in of depression but in doing so I’ve sacrificed my mental health and he doesn’t seem to be any better off so I feel all that was for naught. In the years we’ve been together we moved to a new city that we’ve lived in for 5years and still it’s like the city is like new because he’s very antisocial and we have pretty much not gone out since we moved here. So I haven’t made any new friends as I’ve spent most of my time trying to make him happy and be a homebody all the while begging him to go out to anywhere with me(work social events, parks, anything to get out of the apartment to no avail). I’m pretty exhausted mentally and emotionally from this. Also my mom passed away this summer(was one person I could always turn to) so feeling as lonely as ever.

I’m going to meet my end soon,"Hello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I dont know if it's okay for me to go on a little rant here. I'll remove this if not allowed. This rant is filled with A LOT of hate and some foul language so be warned.,"I despise my family more than I despised the bullies in my old elementary schools. They all think like the one person I hate out of all of them: my mother. I don't even consider her my mother but I don't have any other name to substitute for that other than Medusa but I like Medusa so I'll refer her as Donkey. 

This Donkey can go fuck herself. All of the little ones take after her and it irritates me so much. Every single damned day, I hear them repeat the exact same words at the stupid Donkey and they don't even care about what's right and wrong anymore. The little ones have been negatively influenced by the stupid Donkey and I can't do anything. My favorite ones they've recently learned is ""Kill yourself"" and ""Mommy doesn't like you anymore."" 

The stupid Donkey won't ever shut up even when she knows she's in the wrong. I honestly hate this stupid donkey so much, that I would rather wish her out of existence or better yet, end up dead. I don't care what you guys think of me; whether I'm an ungrateful brat or that one entitled person but it won't matter either way. I'm so tired of it all and she doesn't care. Don't tell me my family misunderstands my feelings, hell, they don't even THINK I have emotions like them. I hate them and want them to disappear or even die in the worst possible way. They don't care about me or my well being and sure as hell made it so very fucking clear that I'm at their disposal. They call me a waste of skin? Nah man, fuck that. THEY'RE the waste of skins, they're the waste of resources, simply having them around is insulting enough. These people are by far the worst I've ever met and if you can do worse, please do. I'm fed up with this life. I'm fed up with everything, my life has no more meaning and I still can't ever bring myself to believe that my friends even care about me.

The stupid Donkey only wants sex and uses my dad for her own personal gain. More kids = more $$ she says. She forgets who has to pay child support and she's over here whoring herself even more. I refuse to take care of her offspring and just by the thought of BEING her offspring is enough to make me puke. She is despicable, she is conniving, she is a liar, she is outright horrible. Believing herself to be the center of attention and wanting to 'steal the spotlight'. Her parents are not aware of this sick behavior and maybe won't believe me if I told them of this. 

I'm just tired of this. I used to have this cute little puppy golden retriever mixbreed and a puppy German Shephard. They ultimately were sent elsewhere (maybe the pound I assume) because the stupid Donkey decided that she didn't like dogs when they didn't listen to her or 'obey' her. It feels like she treats me like a robot, maybe my whole family does treat me like a robot; devoid of human thought and incapable of emotions. They're messed up and I hate them for it. I don't care if they end up not being at fault, I still hate them. Give me back my 15 years of life you all took away from me, forcing me to tend to the flesh parasites that comes out of your vagina because you couldn't keep your legs closed for 2 seconds. 

I want the time you all took for me. I didn't ask for this, you put this all on me the minute you had your 6th flesh parasite. You created so many problems and decided to not own up to your problems, so you burdened your 5th oldest flesh parasite. You are not a mother, you are by far the poorest excuse of a mother. You never take responsibility and you always drink constantly. I'm still surprised that the other flesh parasites came out unaffected whilst you drank during pregnancy. I will hate you forevermore in this life and the next ones. What you've done is unforgivable and I am 100% sure you won't give a fuck since it won't benefit you in any way.

I'll go so far to even spit on your grave when you die. I despise your entire existence so please go to Hell and die a million times in the worst possible way.",OhhhMyLooord,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jy4ac8/i_dont_know_if_its_okay_for_me_to_go_on_a_little/,despise family despised bully old elementary school think like one person hate mother even consider mother name substitute medusa like medusa refer donkey donkey go fuck little one take irritates much every single damned day hear repeat exact word stupid donkey even care right wrong anymore little one negatively influenced stupid donkey anything favorite one recently learned kill mommy like anymore stupid donkey ever shut even know wrong honestly hate stupid donkey much would rather wish existence better yet end dead care guy think whether ungrateful brat one entitled person matter either way tired care tell family misunderstands feeling hell even think emotion like hate want disappear even die worst possible way care well sure hell made fucking clear disposal call waste skin nah man fuck waste skin waste resource simply around insulting enough people far worst ever met worse please fed life fed everything life ha meaning still ever bring believe friend even care stupid donkey want sex us dad personal gain kid say forgets ha pay child support whoring even refuse take care offspring thought offspring enough make puke despicable conniving liar outright horrible believing center attention wanting steal spotlight parent aware sick behavior maybe believe told tired used cute little puppy golden retriever mixbreed puppy german shephard ultimately sent elsewhere maybe pound assume stupid donkey decided like dog listen obey feel like treat like robot maybe whole family doe treat like robot devoid human thought incapable emotion messed hate care end fault still hate give back 15 year life took away forcing tend flesh parasite come vagina keep leg closed 2 second want time took ask put minute 6th flesh parasite created many problem decided problem burdened 5th oldest flesh parasite mother far poorest excuse mother never take responsibility always drink constantly still surprised flesh parasite came unaffected whilst drank pregnancy hate forevermore life next one done unforgivable 100 sure give fuck since benefit way go far even spit grave die despise entire existence please go hell die million time worst possible way,dont know okay go little rant remove allowed rant filled lot hate foul language warned,oh hh loo,3960,169,oh hh loo despise family despised bully old elementary school think like one person hate mother even consider mother name substitute medusa like medusa refer donkey donkey go fuck little one take irritates much every single damned day hear repeat exact word stupid donkey even care right wrong anymore little one negatively influenced stupid donkey anything favorite one recently learned kill mommy like anymore stupid donkey ever shut even know wrong honestly hate stupid donkey much would rather wish existence better yet end dead care guy think whether ungrateful brat one entitled person matter either way tired care tell family misunderstands feeling hell even think emotion like hate want disappear even die worst possible way care well sure hell made fucking clear disposal call waste skin nah man fuck waste skin waste resource simply around insulting enough people far worst ever met worse please fed life fed everything life ha meaning still ever bring believe friend even care stupid donkey want sex us dad personal gain kid say forgets ha pay child support whoring even refuse take care offspring thought offspring enough make puke despicable conniving liar outright horrible believing center attention wanting steal spotlight parent aware sick behavior maybe believe told tired used cute little puppy golden retriever mixbreed puppy german shephard ultimately sent elsewhere maybe pound assume stupid donkey decided like dog listen obey feel like treat like robot maybe whole family doe treat like robot devoid human thought incapable emotion messed hate care end fault still hate give back 15 year life took away forcing tend flesh parasite come vagina keep leg closed 2 second want time took ask put minute 6th flesh parasite created many problem decided problem burdened 5th oldest flesh parasite mother far poorest excuse mother never take responsibility always drink constantly still surprised flesh parasite came unaffected whilst drank pregnancy hate forevermore life next one done unforgivable 100 sure give fuck since benefit way go far even spit grave die despise entire existence please go hell die million time worst possible way dont know okay go little rant remove allowed rant filled lot hate foul language warned

My 22nd birthday,"So today is my birthday. (Hooray...) and the only people to wish me happy birthday are my mom, one of my 3 brothers and a person from iFunny after I posted a meme. I know that it seems self absorbed to think that everyone should with me happy birthday. And I get that. It feels awful to even think that. But when it comes to my birthday, it’s supposed to be the 1 day of the year that I’m supposed to be important to my friends and family. That I’m supposed to feel special. That I’m supposed to know and see that people care about me and the day I was freaking born. My depression is at an all time low right now. It feels like no one bother to remember or care about my birthday. My dad, my other brothers or my best freaking friend. They didn’t tell me happy birthday at all to me today. To reiterate, I know it is self absorbed and selfish to expect a happy birthday from all my friends and family, but would it kill the important people in my like to tell me happy birthday? For them to show that they are happy I was born? Cuz right now I feel like I shouldn’t have been born at all.

Everything's Becoming Meaningless,"I've tried to deal with my depression. I've gone to therapy, and I'm currently on medication. I've looked at countless articles about how to improve, to overcome this. But nothing's working. I'm still haunted by all my past failures. Not a day goes by that I don't think about all the slights, insults, and cruelty I've endured. I'm an adult, and I still can't stop thinking about being bullied in high school. College wasn't much better. I drank a lot in college, and because of that, ended up doing a lot of stupid things that affected my relationships with others. And even though I try and atone for what I did, the regret is so overwhelming that some days I can't get out of bed. Its gotten to the point that everything is starting to lose meaning. What's the point of trying to make new friends? I know people are going to judge me for how I look, or that I'll do something stupid and push them away. What's the point of exercising and trying to improve myself? No matter how much I change, I'll always remember the pathetic failure I am now. Really, I'm starting to think there's no point to anything, because I've come to the belief that happiness lasts for a moment, but pain lasts forever. Why get out of bed? Why try and find things I enjoy? Why care about others? Why should I believe that it gets better? 

I can't find answers to these questions anymore. Something good happens to me and I don't care. I got a job (which I thought would be impossible during Covid) and I feel little to no exicitement. A friend told me they cherished me and all I could think was that they were trying to make themselves feel better, not me. Someone told me I have a beautiful soul, and I nearly cried, because I see nothing beautiful inside myself. Everything I once believed was good about me was crushed a long time ago. 

I'm scared of what I'm becoming. I'm not trying to kill myself, but I think of dying a lot. I want things to get better, but feel I'm too messed up.

"I thought school will help me, but...","I used to be academically-inclined back when I was in college. It was my dream to take my masters and doctorate degree before I reach 30. Life kicked in after college, got a job and I haven't started going back to school until this year.

So I decided to enroll on a master's degree program hoping that it will keep me busy amidst the current pandemic situation. Everything was conducted online anyway, so I thought it will be convenient.

And she laughed at me. The one person who legitimately cares about me, and the one person I can speak to about my mental health, laughed at me. I can't talk to anyone anymore.

"Am I depressed, bipolar, or what","Wtf am I even feeling lately. Every day I feel like I’m a different person. I can be feeling good fine then it’s like out of nowhere I just switch. Just the littlest things can cause me to switch from a happy fine mood to this paranoid, heart racing, overthinking, numb, hateful mess. But I can’t say I have like a trigger that switches it because one day I can talk about topic (A) and be fine then the next day topic (A) will just make me switch into that messy headspace. Idk If any of that makes sense. The crazy thing is I’m recognizing myself doing it as I’m doing it but I just can’t stop. 


Little about me I’m a young mom of one 5 month old girl and dating her father. Our relationship isn’t perfect but I love him more than anything.

Is it weird that my period sometimes makes me feel severely depressed?,"The last time I had my period I felt so bad I spent an hour in the shower crying and shaming myself and dwelling on hopelessness. 
Mostly my periods are uncomfortable and shorter thanks to my BC pills. I have them to curb my pain and nausea that I used to get a lot each month due to my primary dysmenorrhea.
Sometimes I get pain still and/or some nausea, but it's rare that I don't feel major cramping. 
Last time I did a good job on keeping a healthy diet and preparing for my period so it wasn't even painful or majorly discomforting. Instead PMS and depression showed up to sucker punch me so I couldn't even enjoy the victory of no pain. 
I felt like killing myself, but I was so so tired.

I feel guilty for being sad,"I've struggled with depression and anxiety my entire life. I've gone through periods of complete instability and basically constant breakdowns, and was finally starting to feel like maybe I was getting my shit together. I'm doing everything you're supposed to do: taking my meds, trying to stay mindful, had been doing therapy, etc. 
And for fucking once I actually thought I was on the mend. For at least a good while, I actually felt normal. Then it just seems like everything just creeps back in again. I feel so alone and I constantly have been feeling like all my friends are sick of me. I feel like my boyfriend thinks I'm a dumb bitch. I feel like a shit mom.  I feel like a huge burden to everyone in my life. 
Logically I know things could be worse and that it's just my brain being a fucking dick, but at the same time... It doesn't make it any less horrible. I do feel like a dumb bitch. I do feel like a waste of space. I do wish I wouldn't wake up sometimes. I can't get out of my head half the time and my thoughts are just constantly racing.
I'm just so tired of constantly feeling like I'm fighting against myself. I'm so fucking tired. Does it ever end? I'm fairly young still... Almost 30. But the thought of living life like this for another 50+ years is overwhelming. I hate my life. I shouldn't hate my life, because I have all the things I thought would make me happy... And I'm still not. So now what?
Everything feels pointless. I'm angry with myself because I know deep down that's not true... I've FELT what it's like to feel happy and content.

Should I quit my job to focus on my mental health?,"I have been a very depressed person for a very long time and I’ve pretty much reached the end of my rope.

Does knowing how people will react to you if they saw you haunt you?,"Was trying to go to sleep, when I started thought of what would happen if the judgmental people in my life would react to me if they saw me. I envision a reaction full of contempt, feel my heart twist, and then try to formulate a counter-argument to their reaction. But then that formulation is associated with another way someone might undermine me, and I try to think of what I'd say to that, but that leads to another association with how someone might crush me underfoot. So on and so forth. You'd think I'd run out of ways I can imagine people crushing me and memories to draw on for inspiration, but there's no end. Things I didn't even know I remembered come up, and I feel utterly powerless against the harsh judgement of other people, even though I was alone in a dark room.

"I feel my mind is in a gridlocked state, I can't exactly give a name to what I am going through, I need some help.","I am a 24yo man. I am balding. Also, I do not have a job. I am heavily addicted to drinking and smoking. I have never dated a girl ever (I come from an ultra-conservative family). Honestly, I have never been responsible for myself. I didn't do well in school, so I couldn't get a good job while most of my classmates could. Since I am counting dollars for survival, I cannot afford to go out on a date, not even for a coffee. I was a virgin till 23, but then I just got it done with a prostitute. However, I can't afford to visit prostitutes much, if at all. Once I got so desperate that I got drunk and hooked up with a gay man on Tinder, but I couldn't enjoy it at all. I feel a burning desire to hold a woman close to me but I can't have anyone. And this feeling of missing out on physical affection is making me extremely miserable, I can't focus on getting a new job. This is the gridlock - lack of affection doesn't let me work, lack of work(i.e. money) doesn't let me get affection. I have wasted a lot of my money on alcohol and cigarettes, I feel really guilty about that.

I do feel happy when I get drunk. That's why I can't stop drinking once I start. Just a few days ago, I drank 3 Four Lokos and fell down on the street, and called 911. But whenever I don't drink for a couple of days, the reality just comes crashing down. I forget about my balding when I get drunk, but when I get sober, I just break down realizing that I don't have much chances of getting a girlfriend. I can't take it and I drink again. My baldness is my own fault - I masturbated heavily over the past several years, knowing that it will harm me. I just find that my mind stops working whenever I do that.

I know that life is unfair and that I am not as good as the other men out there. I know that sex is a privilege and not a right. However, whenever this realization hits me, I feel a deep knot in my stomach. We get life only once, and I just can't get over the fact that I am going to be bald in this one life that I get. I also can't get over the fact that I missed out on the peak years of my libido. Sometimes, I get some dark thoughts - like buying a pet and killing it. I am afraid to accept the reality that I am not good enough because I feel that that might make me complacent, which might lead to me losing opportunities. I really don't know how to think about my life so as to live the best possible life that I can have. Please help me. I don't have anyone - I can't talk to my parents about this because they are ultra-conservative and they demonize sex.",TheRightSpot,2,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxwrli/i_feel_my_mind_is_in_a_gridlocked_state_i_cant/,24yo man balding also job heavily addicted drinking smoking never dated girl ever come ultra conservative family honestly never responsible well school get good job classmate could since counting dollar survival cannot afford go date even coffee wa virgin till 23 got done prostitute however afford visit prostitute much got desperate got drunk hooked gay man tinder enjoy feel burning desire hold woman close anyone feeling missing physical affection making extremely miserable focus getting new job gridlock lack affection let work lack work e money let get affection wasted lot money alcohol cigarette feel really guilty feel happy get drunk stop drinking start day ago drank 3 four lokos fell street called 911 whenever drink couple day reality come crashing forget balding get drunk get sober break realizing much chance getting girlfriend take drink baldness fault masturbated heavily past several year knowing harm find mind stop working whenever know life unfair good men know sex privilege right however whenever realization hit feel deep knot stomach get life get fact going bald one life get also get fact missed peak year libido sometimes get dark thought like buying pet killing afraid accept reality good enough feel might make complacent might lead losing opportunity really know think life live best possible life please help anyone talk parent ultra conservative demonize sex,feel mind gridlocked state exactly give name going need help,right spot,2559,114,right spot 24yo man balding also job heavily addicted drinking smoking never dated girl ever come ultra conservative family honestly never responsible well school get good job classmate could since counting dollar survival cannot afford go date even coffee wa virgin till 23 got done prostitute however afford visit prostitute much got desperate got drunk hooked gay man tinder enjoy feel burning desire hold woman close anyone feeling missing physical affection making extremely miserable focus getting new job gridlock lack affection let work lack work e money let get affection wasted lot money alcohol cigarette feel really guilty feel happy get drunk stop drinking start day ago drank 3 four lokos fell street called 911 whenever drink couple day reality come crashing forget balding get drunk get sober break realizing much chance getting girlfriend take drink baldness fault masturbated heavily past several year knowing harm find mind stop working whenever know life unfair good men know sex privilege right however whenever realization hit feel deep knot stomach get life get fact going bald one life get also get fact missed peak year libido sometimes get dark thought like buying pet killing afraid accept reality good enough feel might make complacent might lead losing opportunity really know think life live best possible life please help anyone talk parent ultra conservative demonize sex feel mind gridlocked state exactly give name going need help

just makes me more depressed,"I wonder sometimes, if loneliness itself can cause depression, I think im doing ok, besides the fact i havent been close to another human in years and my entire life has been spent alone. I.. really dont even know how conversations work, but i am trying to speak more which is good. 

relationships seem alien to me, and i can barely talk to people like a normal person would. No friends, no family, this really sucks man... 

smoking weed alone really makes me feel more depressed

same with drinking, just more sad.

Usually, between the stress and not having time to think for even a few minutes makes it so I usually feel okay when I’m at work, or getting ready for work.

Without the adrenaline and stress of work, I have a hard time finding any reason to get out of bed, I have no interest in doing anything, and I’m overall incredibly disinterested and dissatisfied with life in general.

It’s really starting to affect my relationship because my boyfriend feels helpless, and in trying to make me feel better and find things for us to do, he ends up also feeling crappy. I feel so guilty and I can’t keep going like this.

Been Thinking About Doing It,"Recently I dropped all contact online with people who were my friends. I've been planning it for months on end, but recently it came to a head and I just gave up and deleted everything I have, minus an email. It feels like there's no point in speaking with anyone. We don't share much of anything in common anymore, and I don't know who to trust. It feels like no one wants me around and they probably talk behind my back, just like everyone I have ever been friends with. I don't even know if they care I left, but I hope they don't so it will be easier to end it. They are better off without me anyway, since I just bring everyone down. They deserve someone who can be there for them and not just talk about how much they just want to die. I hope they hate me so it doesn't hurt them knowing I am planning on doing this. I just want to be forgotten since I don't matter.

Only thing stopping me from doing it is my parents. It would break their hearts if I did that to them, and every time I think about killing myself it hurts more knowing it would hurt them too. So I'm stuck in a never ending loop of self hatred and wanting to die, but not having the nerve to just go through with blowing my brains out with the gun we keep in the house. I don't even know if I want to die, but more just want to disappear. I'm not much use to anyone since I can't work, but I can't get disability, so when my parents die I am just done. I got maybe another ten to twenty years to wait unless something happens before that. I just want it all to stop, and nothing helps anymore. I just want to be alone so I can do it without it hurting someone else.

So im a hopeless in abandonment.,"So for the last three years i have been burying myself in books and movies and tv and video games and unfortunately drugs, its not bad drugs, its a herb in Thailand.
But this last year has put me on the gloomy train.
And its been hard and there is soooo much to this story of mine and so little space on here.
But long story short, i just lost my dad when i was 9.
When i was 5, i was molested by my older step sister and brother, but my sister was more forceful about it.
When i was 12 all the way until i was 15, i was put into a mental facility for my anger towards my past, i was violent, i was born into a lack of emotional family of drunk germans, so that means my mother was at the bar every night so i was neglected and abandoned even at the facility.
Anywuas, im a fricken mess and ots all flooding back to my from my subconscious and emotions are so wild and its hard to feel them so like i said, i started doing drugs and reading and poetry and running away into the videoverse.
I am a broken record because I've been trying to quit drugs for a year now and i dont have anyone to help me, when my dad died, al my brothers and sisters got adapted and taken away from my step mom, so now its just me and my. Mother, but shes not very helpful and She s a mess too, and i cant count on her to help me overcome my own addiction when she's drinking all the time.
Anyways, when i was a angry child, my grandmother disowned me to my face when i was 10, she told me when didn't want me and she always invited my other brothers and sisters to her house and never wanted me to come.
And then my grandmother and grandpa on my dads side put a restraining order on me because my older step sister and brother did drugs when my dad died and they thought a ten year old (me) was just as bad, so i havent spoke to them sense i was a wee las.
So i am well.....
I feel worthless and meaningless and i feel as good as a garbage can becuase thats how everyone treated me as a child and adult.
I wish i was born into a real family, i mean i think its cool that my ancestors were crazy kings of the 18th century germany, and my great aunt owns have of munic, but it doesnt make up for the shite my family did to me and what i did to them.

So i found one certainly and its traveling, just the thought of being on the open road and climbing  mountains and being in a new town and city everyday litterly cures my sadness and makes me feel so happy!
But my one way flight to Norway got canceled in April becuase of the coronavirus, so im crying about that too.
And it makes me want drugs even more because my life is so mundane and boring and i dislike a predictable routine.",arrriah,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxyc4n/so_im_a_hopeless_in_abandonment/,last three year burying book movie tv video game unfortunately drug bad drug herb thailand last year ha put gloomy train hard soooo much story mine little space long story short lost dad wa 9 wa 5 wa molested older step sister brother sister wa forceful wa 12 way wa 15 wa put mental facility anger towards past wa violent wa born lack emotional family drunk german mean mother wa bar every night wa neglected abandoned even facility anywuas im fricken mess ots flooding back subconscious emotion wild hard feel like said started drug reading poetry running away videoverse broken record trying quit drug year dont anyone help dad died al brother sister got adapted taken away step mom mother shes helpful mess cant count help overcome addiction drinking time anyways wa angry child grandmother disowned face wa 10 told want always invited brother sister house never wanted come grandmother grandpa dad side put restraining order older step sister brother drug dad died thought ten year old wa bad havent spoke sense wa wee la well feel worthless meaningless feel good garbage becuase thats everyone treated child adult wish wa born real family mean think cool ancestor crazy king 18th century germany great aunt owns munic doesnt make shite family found one certainly traveling thought open road climbing mountain new town city everyday litterly cure sadness make feel happy one way flight norway got canceled april becuase coronavirus im cry make want drug even life mundane boring dislike predictable routine,im hopeless abandonment,arr ria h,2660,32,arr ria h last three year burying book movie tv video game unfortunately drug bad drug herb thailand last year ha put gloomy train hard soooo much story mine little space long story short lost dad wa 9 wa 5 wa molested older step sister brother sister wa forceful wa 12 way wa 15 wa put mental facility anger towards past wa violent wa born lack emotional family drunk german mean mother wa bar every night wa neglected abandoned even facility anywuas im fricken mess ots flooding back subconscious emotion wild hard feel like said started drug reading poetry running away videoverse broken record trying quit drug year dont anyone help dad died al brother sister got adapted taken away step mom mother shes helpful mess cant count help overcome addiction drinking time anyways wa angry child grandmother disowned face wa 10 told want always invited brother sister house never wanted come grandmother grandpa dad side put restraining order older step sister brother drug dad died thought ten year old wa bad havent spoke sense wa wee la well feel worthless meaningless feel good garbage becuase thats everyone treated child adult wish wa born real family mean think cool ancestor crazy king 18th century germany great aunt owns munic doesnt make shite family found one certainly traveling thought open road climbing mountain new town city everyday litterly cure sadness make feel happy one way flight norway got canceled april becuase coronavirus im cry make want drug even life mundane boring dislike predictable routine im hopeless abandonment

Can you please tell me what the hell is this??!,"Alright, so I've noticed very small and slight patterns of OCD in my personality since I was quite young. I've never really done anything about it since I was aware of the fact that it mostly had to do and was related to low self confidence that over time as I grew older thankfully got a lot better. However today still, whenever I have to present myself to the world let's say through pictures or even worse videos, something terrible kicks in, and takes over me. I'm writing this post after I had to complete an online job interview by submitting a 40 sec presentation of myself. 

When I read video submission of myself I knew right away. I thought though, alright let's give it a try maybe it'll be better this time maybe I'll manage, and I'll do this stupid thing in one take. Yeah right, sweet dreams. It took me almost 2 hours, 2 hours to finally say okay I think, with emphasize on I think I have it. In the making of my video I've bumped into the following issues : not liking my voice in one, not liking my face in the other, not liking the tone I was using to say words in another one, not liking the way I blink, not liking my side eye, not liking how I open my mouth and so on. Yes, I know how this sounds, these are not metaphors, these were all real reasons why I stopped and redid it again and again and again. At one point I thought okay I have it, then something deep inside compelled me so strongly to give it another take, and another and another, because it's not good enough, it can be better. This is why I'm linking this issue to OCD I believe. Because of that strong feeling of not being able to stop. Please be so kind to tell me and let me know what do you think this is?? It's killing me sometimes and makes me hate myself. It's unacceptable to literally loose 2 hrs of my life and my time over something so stupid and insignificant. I know that from the outside it looks like I have huge confidence issues, but generally speaking with people, friends, going out, I'm not shy, awkward or unsure at all. I love socializing and I generally have a good opinion of myself in healthy way so I don't struggle with it externally only internally and just when it comes to things like this - pictures, videos, projects etc. Anything through which I have to prove myself. I'm make a too big deal of it even though literally no one cares that much. I'm sickly harsh with myself and have a dose of perfectionism in personality that rockets through the sky sometimes as presented above. Sadly, whenever we send videos back and forth with my friend who knows me deeply and closely, I'm the same. Not as bad, but do so many takes, that that's why I generally and normally refuse to partake in things like that completely. Is it anxiety, is it OCD what the hell is this?

I have decided to get sterilisation (F/22),"Im typing this cause it distracts myself from self harming.
.
.
I have a massive hatred towards my parents. I was born and raised by a hardcore Christian mother and an emotional absive father. 


Mom was clinically diagnosis as mostly sterile before my parents got married. My dad think it was a great idea to have no contraception during intercourse... which leads their marriage to a financially struggling situation from the get-go. 
 My mom is a overly optimistic person, she often express that I was God's gift. And that I should be happy to live my life. And for my dad, I see him regrets marrying this delusional woman and having kids. My dad never has the patient and compassion for children. For the pass 21 years, I was traumatize by all his screaming and scolding. I was able to move out with my boyfriend last year. I rarely see my dad currently, but for times I have to attend fanily gatherings, i am stressed out and want to leave immediately just by interacting with dad.


Recently I was hospitalized for my depression. During the stay, I was informed that my grandmothers from both sides of the family suffers from depression and anxiety as well. Which got me wondering if Im more prone to have mental illness deal to genetics.


Going back to my topic, I am planning to get sterilisation next year. I don't mind interacting with children. However I can't see myself raising a child of my own. I will not forgive myself if my child has to suffer with mental illness passed down from generations. 


To many people in my country, this idea is absurd. However I rather be membered as a no body, than a depressed mother who neglected their child when I die.

I think I have an illness and my mom thinks its normal.,"I've been having mental problems since 6th grade. At first I though that these were normal meltdowns until I realized that I was not normal. I had lots of social anxiety inherited from my family, who were all naturally anxious. My dad is the only calming force in my life. My mom has high-functioning ADD and she told me that she had a lot of experiences like mine, such as: bashing her head on a wall, shaving her head, throwing a printer at my uncle, tearing her homework apart- she obviously had very repressed and undiagnosed illnesses. My grandfather suffered from an abusive household when he was younger and has retained a whole lot of anxiety from it. He is a darling old dude and I love him dearly. I feel like my mom would rather have me ""deal with it"" instead of going to therapy or getting me diagnosed. She doesn't show her sad emotions a lot. Not since she got her heart broken four yeas ago. But for some reason, over the past few years she's been unempathetic and doesn't even react when I cry out. She only apologizes or shows emotions later on. I think she's toxic for me but at the same time she's not abusive.

I want to help as much as I can,"Hey everyone. My boyfriend and I have been doing long distance for about 2 years now. He opened up to me about a year ago about his depression and what he goes through, and i’ve been there for him through everything. It seems to mostly effect him in the mornings. Some days he is up/bright/bubbly, other days he can’t get out of bed/quick to anger/upset/crying. I’ve been researching and reading up as much as i can on depression since i have never experienced it hands on. 

When it comes to night time, he’s a completely different person from the morning, like he did a 180. I have been telling him how proud of him I am when he does the little things i know are hard. For example, getting out of bed and going outside to get fresh air, making a meal and eating it, taking a shower. When the morning rolls around, it seems to have all come back again. And i understand why. 

I was thinking it would benefit him to seek professional help through a therapist or a counselor? I don’t have too much understand about any of that, but i would like to know if therapy has benefited/worsened your depression and why? 

He has also made it clear to me that he doesn’t want to be on medication to change him, which of course i agree with, but maybe there’s something out there that won’t make him feel the way he does in the mornings &amp; help him get through the day temporarily. 

I told him i’m never leaving his side and i’m here through anything and everything. I really love him and i would love to do anything i can that would be a benefit to him. 

Side Note: The distance is the least problem here. We have been pushing through the distance for our end goal in the near future. Once you are doing long distance for a while, you really get the hang of it :)

Hi everyone ~ ! 
Im just posting because.. 
Well, so I can’t say I fully understand everyone’s situation. I know everyone is different. But I know what it’s like to feel like the loneliest person in entire earth. I know what it feels like to want to end everything and put a stop to you. 
Ive tried to end my life in the past, it’s a decision that would’ve changed everything. Even now, I still think to myself “what if I decided to just end it?” 
Either way this isn’t about me! 
I just want to let you all know that I (If you believe no one cares), I care about you. I like to say I have a big heart and care for everyone. I like to listen to people and talk to people. 
I know I sound cliche and it maybe stupid but I just don’t want anyone to feel as alone as they think they are. 
Im here for you. 
As a fellow sad person(I prefer sad over depressed), I am with you. 
For anyone who wants to talk/vent/advice, or just maybe start up a friendship, feel free to message me. I’m always on my phone so I’m always free.

"I’m facing a triple threat, and I’m about to loose","I need advice quick. I’m already on max dose of antidepressants but it’s not enough now. 

1) I’ve been extremely weak and bed ridden for the last 16 months with an illness that doctors can’t diagnose. I can only take 2,000 - 2,500 steps per day. Talking for more than 15 min exhausts me to the point I start slurring and going limp. My entire existence is doing 1 load of laundry and 1 load of dishes per day. That’s it. What sucks is my mind is still running at 100%. I feel like a Lamborghini trapped in a go cart with a busted wheel. Not to mention I’m a 7/10 level pain (at least), 24 hours a day 

2) COVID. I can’t even go to Target and scoot around on their electric buggies. I couldn’t fight off a cold right now, let alone COVID

3) My husband has stopped paying attention to me. He’s probably sick of dealing with a completely dependent wife. He doesn’t listen when I try to talk about it. 

Guys I need to find something to occupy my mind and entertain me or I’m going to wind up attempting suicide again. I have no purpose. I feel completely useless. And the boredom is crippling. After 16 months of this I’m sick of TV and the one hobby I can do (crochet).  I can’t afford a therapist. I have no friends left, they all disappeared the minute I got sick. I don’t know what to do. I feel so isolated and useless 

EDIT: please.....I appreciate the consideration but I’m not looking for medical advice about my mystery physical condition. That’s not why I’m here. Believe me when I tell you that every possible medical condition has been checked for by a team of doctors. In 16 months I’ve had 56 doctor, lab and imaging appointments. I’ve seen 6 different specialties of doctor, WITH second opinions on all of them. What I need help with is the crippling loneliness, boredom and depression. Again I appreciate any concern about my medical condition but that’s a whole different ball of wax. 

In short: YES I have been tested for that. YES I have tried that. NO it didn’t help. 

Again I know it’s well intended but I need mental help, not help with my physical affliction. If comments just becomes focused on the latter, I’m going to take this post down because I’ve heard it all.

 To stave off loneliness I was hoping to keep one partner (I'm poly and pan). 
I reached out to someone I really enjoy spending time with and they aren't sure if they'll keep me in their bubble. 
It is totally their choice, and I'm glad they're being cautious too. But I am sad they don't want me. 
Then after talking to my other partner, looks like they aren't able to be in my bubble either. 
 I thrive on physical touch and it looks like I won't be getting any. 
I know this isn't a super huge problem, this will pass, but it's hurting right now, and I wasn't sure who to talk to about this.

I’ve felt like this for the majority of the past 2 years. BUT seconds ago as I was getting out of the shower I realized for the last month or so I’ve been showering daily or every other day.

I want to disappear,"I quite frankly want to disappear. I don't want to talk to anybody - friends, family, professors, whoever. Just completely disappear. I put my heart into all the relationships I have, to truly care for the person and making sure they know that. I've always known that they don't have the same heart I do, that they don't outwardly show how they care for me. And I know they care for me - but I never really feel they do, maybe only superficially. This is with every relationship I have and I cannot keep going. I try to make sure everyone is ok, is it too much to desire that one person does the same for me.

"So... I need advise, please.","I have so many ideas in my head about clips that i want to make, or montage, or record, i have ideas for my videos, but i also have lazines that throw it all away and give me, not suicidal thoughts, yet thoughts about my helplessnesses and pointlessness. I saw some posts about it already and all comments says you need to workout or eat healthy food or simillar to this, however, when i try it - it give me literally 0 result, whenever i eat bag of chips or eat porridge, and when i walk outside or i sit at home. Also i have troubles with communication to people, like i can't interrupt or say something when someone talking in angry tone, or even chating online give me stress and wish to isolate myself, but on other side - i want to communicate

Funniest things in all my situation that (i know they can and ALREADY MAKE it worse):

1. I, myself, try to help everyone with they're mental health and giving advise that ACTUALLY work and helped them
2. After helping them, no one stays and continue to talk with me, and i think i know why, but some said that i am just ""not ready"" to be friend with them (how does it even work), other did not say anything, they just leave
3. Because of №2, i've never been hugged in my life (beside my mom, tho, i don't even let her anymore, because for me it feel somehow wrong or idk)
4. And because of №3, my longest, ahem, ""relationship"" were 1 hour. (Because so many people find in relationship they're hope and motivation)

Now i graduated from school after 9th grade, i am \~16 (You can say that's all because of hormones and instability in 13-19, and you be right, but i still think there is something more than that) try to make my ideas through it, and it cause more disgust and gives even more laziness.

Other information that could help you to help me:

1. I am in Russia.
2. I had 3 concussions.
3. Now I have tried to completely isolate myself, and this is not related to the COVID.

Just chatting,"Hello. I‘m new to this whole reddit thing but I thought thats the only way to talk about my problems without feeling ashamed. I’m trying my best to put it in words which is kinda hard. So first of I’m 27 years old and I deal with depression a long time back when the woman who raised me died in 2013 or maybe even earlier when my grandma died in 2005 both due to cancer. But 2013 hit me way harder or it’s my whole life in general. My mom got pregnant with me at 15 years old and got left by my dad we are from a small town in Germany so I was the number 1 talk around the village and because she didn’t had the time for me my aunt took care of me basically my whole life until she died in 2013. And when I first heard the news of her having cancer I kinda shutdown before I was an outgoing person had me friends and at the time I just turned 18 so I thought hell yeah now I can party my ass off and drive around my car and have the time of my life but after I received the news I completely self isolated. I didn’t answer messages from my friends or family and just dove into video games to get my mind off of it. I ordered stuff online which I couldn’t pay at the end. I kinda turned in this self destructive mode which I didn’t care about what’s happening with my relationships or myself. I didn’t even talk with my aunt that much because I couldn’t see her suffering which haunts me till this day. I was so selfish that I didn’t understand with me not talking to her that much she suffered even more. . So we are talking about a time
Period of about 2years so from early 2011 to late 2013. So in that time I had to undergo surgery myself which put me back even further and I isolated even more. The healing process took way longer than expected and I couldn’t do anything and even needed help getting to the toilet. It took until one family member told me my aunt only had a couple of weeks left to live that I kinda got out of the hole got a job and helped more at home. I found a really supportive company with a great boss and everything turned more to the bright side until my aunt died right before my apprenticeship started. I took some time off before to help more at home and my aunt ask me if I still have my job. After that I lost completely the ground under my feet and if I didn’t get back with my school sweetheart a few months earlier I’d probably try and kill myself. My boss told me I had all the support from the company that I need and I can take as much time of as I want. Which was a great help. So after I got kinda fit again I started working again did my apprenticeship with a great end score. But then I heard the news that my dad died I tried reaching out to him a few times as kid but he refused it all the time but there was always that little hope that I might could connect with him in the future and that this hope was gone too I lost it again. It kinda hit me as hard as when my aunt died. But now I was part of this company for a few years and they supported me the whole time and I didn’t want to disappoint either them or my girlfriend. So after I got back up again I moved out of the house away from my uncle. He made me the black sheep for everything happening after my aunt died and put me in such a bad mood that I couldn’t live there anymore so my boss helped me find an apartment and supported me with everything he is like the dad I’ve never had which sounds kinda corny but yeah. So I lived in the apartment with me girlfriend I was doing great. Everything worked and almost anything I tried worked. I was doing great at my job I live with my dream girl until I got the same condition again that I’ve had before and needed another surgery and this time the healing process wouldn’t stop so I got way less money from my health insurance I couldn’t afford rent anymore. The bills started coming in so I decided to start working again earlier than I should. And my condition got worse the scar I got from the surgery wouldn’t heal properly. To stop all this mess we moved back in in the house of my uncle who begged me all the time to come back again. So I agreed because my girlfriend and I could really need this relief from rent and everything. But my scar still wouldn’t heal. So I had to stop working and undergo surgery again and this time they had to remove skin from my butt and lift it over my scar so I had to spent 7 days in hospital and couldn’t go to toilet without help again. The surgery happened in February this year and it put me in such a funk because now my girlfriend had to wipe my butt had to shower me and I had such a remorse to put her through all of that this whole time. She went through everything with me. So basically now I am sick for nearly 2 years my mental and financial condition gets worse every month and I am in such a bad mood that I feel almost like the time again where my aunt got sick and died. I hope I didn’t jump through the time to much but I had to let go everything and tell someone.",qntze,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxuf8u/just_chatting/,hello new whole reddit

I’m really tired of feeling so alone.,"I’m really tired of how I’ve been feeling emotionally

I have been broken up with my ex-girlfriend for a year and 5 months after being together for 5 years. We got in a really bad argument when I was having a manic episode, that wasn’t even diagnosed at that point. I never got to say goodbye properly to her after the argument because I was put in a psyche ward for having  suicidal thoughts . We were best friends before being lovers and that’s what hurts the most. Everyday I struggle why it just seems like she’s vanished from my life. We had ups and downs in our relationship but I really wish things didn’t end up the way they did.

I have no way to contact her because I’m blocked ( I understand it’s creepy to harass an ex). I’ve had encounters with other women since then and no one matches up to her and how she made me feel as a person. The sense of exploration we had together was unmatched. Always thought she would be apart of my life forever. I have had zero contact with her and it makes me feel awful that I can’t see her smile again.

I was diagnosed with bi polar manic after the manic episode and the stay in the hospital. I was put on a bunch of different pills like mood stabilizers etc, to try and help me feel more normal but I felt like they made me have panic attacks and made me feel so off and angry so I flushed them and just continued to smoke weed to combat my anxiety that I have. I have friends that I love and family that I love but it just never seems like enough. 

I try my best everyday but the thoughts about what happened at the end of our relationship wreck me every single day because we were so close to each other for so long. It’s really been tearing me up.

My husband thinks I’m being over medicated. Advice needed.,"We have been married for a little over two years. I have had depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts since I was young however I kept it hidden until a year ago when I attempted suicide.

Before then everyone though of me as gregarious, funny, outgoing, someone going places, but really I was just good at copying behaviors I thought people appreciated and keeping the rest hidden. 

Since my attempt I have opened up to my family and husband about how I coped with alcohol and pot without him knowing. How I planned and and took steps to end my life, and that I just felt dull and out of place.

He has been such a rock and so supportive, I promised I would not have another attempt and would try everything. That I would seek therapy, be honest with my therapist and psychiatrist, and take any meds that I needed too in front of him everyday and above all be honest with him on how I was doing.

I was diagnosed with major depression with manic episodes (possibly bipolar type 1), major anxiety, and ADHD. After meeting with a therapist weekly for an hr and with a psychiatrist every 10 days for 8 weeks I have finally reached what I feel is suppose to be “normal” but my husband is now worried I’m over medicated. I feel level headed but not like a zombie, like my head is now organized and not cluttered, that I can actually prioritize things and achieve them without beating myself up if I do not get to everything. I’m working out and eating healthy, not drinking any alcohol or smoking any pot, journaling, and most of all no longer have suicidal thoughts or ideas. 

However my husband is concerned and is now wanting me to reduce my medication, not because of any unwanted behaviors but because of the number and frequency of medications. I realize this is a lot and not completely specific to depression but wanted to see if anyone has dealt with this before or this mix of medications and what has or has not worked for them. 

This is my current medication schedule:
8am- 40 mg of Prozac, .5 mg of Klonopin, and 10 mg of adderall

Noon- 10 mg of adderall

4pm- .5 mg of klonopin

5pm- 10 mg of adderall

An hour before bed- 2 mg of pracozin (for night terrors)

Recently diagnosed and just plain confused,"So, I've recently been diagnosed with depression and I'm still not sure how I feel about it. I've always thought I was depressed cause I haven't really felt ""genuine"" happiness since around 3rd, 4th, or 5th grade (I'm a junior in high school now and that time in my life kind of just seems like a blurred jumble now..), but my doctor doesn't know about that part. They just assumed it was all the pandemic's and the relationship I have with my mother's fault. I really didn't have the heart to tell him that I'd not been happy since I was a child or tell him that I had been contemplating self-harm and death since I was around that young age..especially not in front of my mother who now feels like a terrible parent for ""causing"" this even though it's not her fault. If anything, the depression caused the rift in our relationship, not the other way around. I feel so scared of checkups now because the first one we went to was just to see if I had ADHD (I did..) and it turned into a ""well you're depressed. You have a horrible relationship with your mother"" session. But the big thing was the invasion of privacy and I'm afraid it will happen again. He made me give him my phone to look through the music I listen to...is that normal? Because it made me feel sick to my stomach. But what worries me most is that in the last week or two I've been saying ""kill me"" and ""murder me"" without meaning to or wanting to.. I have tics that come with my ADHD and I'm worried this just became a new one. I don't really know what it means... and what really sucks is that I can't remember what actual true happiness feels like or when I actually last experienced it or if I ever really did...Is this normal?

I recognize my very real symptoms and I receive medical help for them but I’ve never received a diagnosis. Do I need a diagnosis?

I’m drowning.,"I wish I could say that post is an overreaction of some sort but I really am. I feel like I’m just being forced down deeper and deeper into the depths of this thing. I feel fucking lost, I feel broken.

I’m panicking everyday that this fucked up virus is going to somehow get into my system and possibly kill me, I’m getting scared of how scared I am at this point. I feel like there’s no kind of escape in this life. I just don’t want to do this anymore.

I’m just so fucked up. I don’t know what else to do in this life. I’m scared. What do I even do at this point in time? I’m terrified and filled with pure dread and anxiety every day from the very moment I wake up until the moment I finally sleep and that’s not easy for me due to my insomnia brought on by severe anxiety and stress.

I haven’t left my home since mid-February and ever since then, day by day, week by week, month by fucking month, I’ve been getting worse and worse. I’m basically alone for 24 hours a day as my housemate works a lot, which is even scarier due to COVID as I suspect somebody at their work has the virus, and even when they are around, it’s usually the dead of night.

What the fuck do I even do at this point? I’ve been thinking bad things again and I don’t know what to do about it. I’ve *tried* multiple times in the past and never succeeded and for years, I’ve managed to avoid this mindset completely but it’s come back this year and I’m scared.

I don’t really know why I’m typing all of this but I just don’t know what else to do. I’m afraid that I won’t be around to see next year and that’s a terrifying thought.",TheHypocondriac,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxqo42/im_drowning/,wish could say post overreaction sort really feel like forced deeper deeper depth thing feel fucking lost feel broken panicking everyday fucked virus going somehow get system possibly kill getting scared scared point feel like kind escape life want anymore fucked know else life scared even point time terrified filled pure dread anxiety every day moment wake moment finally sleep easy due insomnia brought severe anxiety stress left home since mid february ever since day day week week month fucking month getting worse worse basically alone 24 hour day housemate work lot even scarier due covid suspect somebody work ha virus even around usually dead night fuck even point thinking bad thing know tried multiple time past never succeeded year managed avoid mindset completely come back year scared really know typing know else afraid around see next year terrifying thought,drowning,hypo cond ria c,1609,13,hypo cond ria c wish could say post overreaction sort really feel like forced deeper deeper depth thing feel fucking lost feel broken panicking everyday fucked virus going somehow get system possibly kill getting scared scared point feel like kind escape life want anymore fucked know else life scared even point time terrified filled pure dread anxiety every day moment wake moment finally sleep easy due insomnia brought severe anxiety stress left home since mid february ever since day day week week month fucking month getting worse worse basically alone 24 hour day housemate work lot even scarier due covid suspect somebody work ha virus even around usually dead night fuck even point thinking bad thing know tried multiple time past never succeeded year managed avoid mindset completely come back year scared really know typing know else afraid around see next year terrifying thought drowning
"I felt one moment of peace this week, for the first time in a long while","I've been struggling with depression on-and-off for several years. The latest period had its roots pre-covid but since covid started, it got real bad. I know that for some people depression feels like emptiness and a loss of sensation, but for me it's often the opposite. I feel so overwhelmed by feelings and thoughts that I can't function anymore. It's like a constant storm in my mind, trying to figure out what the hell is going on with me and it's exhausting. In the past few weeks I've had my heart broken and felt lonelier than usual, and often I'd just lie in bed, crying and feeling like shit. Not gonna detail the stuff that happened in the couple of days leading up to this, cause it's a lot, but this Wednesday, I had a sudden urge to go out for a run. I don't normally do it, but I felt like I really needed to get out of the house for a bit and let out some energy. I'm a bad athlete, but somehow I managed to run for way longer than I usually do. I live by the beach, so naturally I took a route that overlooks the ocean, and I was just struck by how peaceful everything is. I sat on a bunch of rocks right by the sea, and it seemed weirdly different this time. It seemed solid, and it made me calm. I continued to sit there for like 30 minutes, just appreciating the moment of peace I was in. It felt like everything was going to be fine, and like I could do anything. There were even tears of joy in my eye. I'm not new to crying, but I almost never cry tears of joy. I knew it's not gonna last, and sure enough a couple hours later I was in bed again and barely functioning, but I think that one moment shows that maybe I have it in me to make it out of depression.",orko1995,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxo6j4/i_felt_one_moment_of_peace_this_week_for_the/,struggling depression several year latest period root pre covid since covid started got real bad know people depression feel like emptiness loss sensation often opposite feel overwhelmed feeling thought function anymore like constant storm mind trying figure hell going exhausting past week heart broken felt lonelier usual often lie bed cry feeling like shit gonna detail stuff happened couple day leading cause lot wednesday sudden urge go run normally felt like really needed get house bit let energy bad athlete somehow managed run way longer usually live beach naturally took route overlook ocean wa struck peaceful everything sat bunch rock right sea seemed weirdly different time seemed solid made calm continued sit like 30 minute appreciating moment peace wa felt like everything wa going fine like could anything even tear joy eye new cry almost never cry tear joy knew gonna last sure enough couple hour later wa bed barely functioning think one moment show maybe make depression,felt one moment peace week first time long,ko 1995,1683,72,ko 1995 struggling depression several year latest period root pre covid since covid started got real bad know people depression feel like emptiness loss sensation often opposite feel overwhelmed feeling thought function anymore like constant storm mind trying figure hell going exhausting past week heart broken felt lonelier usual often lie bed cry feeling like shit gonna detail stuff happened couple day leading cause lot wednesday sudden urge go run normally felt like really needed get house bit let energy bad athlete somehow managed run way longer usually live beach naturally took route overlook ocean wa struck peaceful everything sat bunch rock right sea seemed weirdly different time seemed solid made calm continued sit like 30 minute appreciating moment peace wa felt like everything wa going fine like could anything even tear joy eye new cry almost never cry tear joy knew gonna last sure enough couple hour later wa bed barely functioning think one moment show maybe make depression felt one moment peace week first time long

How could I ever find a point in living after reaching this point.,"I'm at a point where I see any sort of effort to change, as a waste of energy. There's no real reason to exist. Everyone's just trying to make their lives as pleasant as possible but I don't even have the energy and ability to do that anymore. As soon as I try to think positive I feel like I'm trying to go to war with my head. Even if I manage to find something I can focus on, it's never really lifting up my mood. All my emotions just feel dull in a way. There are so many things I would like to do but the amount of energy I have to spend on just trying to get started isn't worth it, so I just never do anything anymore.

And u would say those phrases. 

And it especially hit when through time over the years the water would wash away her delicate features until she was unrecognizable along with her memories of what drove her to be walking in the first place.

I’ve started to put my plan in motion,"I’ve been depressed for almost 2 years now. Been in a on and off relationship for the past 4 years. The woman I love left me and has since blocked me on everything and won’t respond to any of my messages. She finally broke things off completely because I admitted that I wanted to kill myself because of the pain I carry from us being apart. She told me that she couldn’t deal with my manipulation anymore. Playing her feelings. But I wasn’t trying too. I was being honest with my feelings. Now after 5 months of no contact I just can’t handle it anymore. I feel despair and like a failure for losing her. I’m 27, down to 90lbs, and can barely look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted with myself. Since the beginning of the year I lost her, my job, my car, my apartment and now I’m living with my parents again. I’ve tried medication, going to in patient facilities and talking to my parents but I just can’t see the light. So I finally decided to sell anything of value I have and put that money towards getting a gun. I’m currently in the process of selling things to get enough money. I’ve found sites like armslist and texasguntrader that have listings for guns where you can meet up with someone to buy kinda Craigslist style. Once I get the gun I plan on going somewhere peaceful outside and enjoy my last moments starring at the stars. My depression is so bad that my dad told me he’s going to buy me another car but I don’t even want it. I’m hoping I can carry out my plan before he wastes the money. I could win the lottery with the damn mega ball and cash option and still wouldn’t make me crack a smile or see a glimmer of hope. I’m old enough to realize that material things won’t give me happiness but rather the connections I have with others. But the only connection I care about having is with my ex. I wanted to marry her, buy us a house, and have children together. But I lost her and know she’s never coming back to me ever again. I just want the pain I have in my heart and mind to go away. I’ve tried before to get over her and I already know that I’m not able to. I hope she’s happy and has a life that she’s always dreamed of. She’s a great woman and so beautiful inside and out.

Why does it have to be so unfair...,"This is not a comparison post but a vent from a mind that's been suffering too much all its life.

I sometimes feel that if I was a successful person or if I earned my living consistently perhaps I would be able to voice my desires. I need not keep my life hidden even from my family.

I hate to admit that I feel a yearning when I see girls even younger than me do what they want without having to play hide and seek with their relationships. 

You earn respect only when you earn some money. If you have anxiety, stutter and due to circumstances are dependent on your family then it feels like you don't have any right to say that you're in a relationship. 

I wish I was accomplished enough and could enjoy my love life without having to hide it from my family.
Age doesn't matter when you're from an over protective family. 

I feel so miserable. I feel like I would just die living my life like this because I see no progress in my life and also in the way my family sees me.

The ones that were with me when I was a kid are now either married, working or are far more different than how they were at that time but here I am still the same dumb person with a burden of a personality, wondering that I am still the same and even my family sees me and treats me the same way.

I don't even know whether I would be any different 2 years or even 10 years from now on and I hate to even think about it.

I believe that I chose to be depressed,"many crucial decisions in my life I made recklessly with no consideration to the consequences. I believed that nothing bad can happen I can always get myself together, but how stupid and irresponsible is that. I didn’t take care of my body, constantly eating junk food and wasted my life on bed or over the couch surfing the internet. I never tried to find a hobby, or improve a skill that I have, I went with life as if it was a meaningless game as if there was no future ahead of me that I need to prepare for. So yes, I indirectly chose to be depressed, I sat myself up for failure and have no one else to blame but myself. 
now I’m stuck in a job that I suck at with colleagues that I hate and yet see myself inferior too. I cannot look myself in the mirror without hating what I’m seeing, I’m too self-conscious of my appearance and behaviour to a point where my existence in the outer world makes me cringe, a big disgusting and ugly man baby walking around a waste of oxygen. One thing worries me is the possibility of it to get worse and I become suicidal, that idea scare the shit out of me and apparently it’s where I’m headed to if I don’t make serious changes in how I lead my life.",throwawayBPDsa,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxvin1/i_believe_that_i_chose_to_be_depressed/,many crucial decision life made recklessly consideration consequence believed nothing bad happen always get together stupid irresponsible take care body constantly eating junk food wasted life bed couch surfing internet never tried find hobby improve skill went life wa meaningless game wa future ahead need prepare yes indirectly chose depressed sat failure one else blame stuck job suck colleague hate yet see inferior cannot look mirror without hating seeing self conscious appearance behaviour point existence outer world make cringe big disgusting ugly man baby walking around waste oxygen one thing worry possibility get worse become suicidal idea scare shit apparently headed make serious change lead life,believe chose depressed,throwaway bpd,1194,38,throwaway bpd many crucial decision life made recklessly consideration consequence believed nothing bad happen always get together stupid irresponsible take care body constantly eating junk food wasted life bed couch surfing internet never tried find hobby improve skill went life wa meaningless game wa future ahead need prepare yes indirectly chose depressed sat failure one else blame stuck job suck colleague hate yet see inferior cannot look mirror without hating seeing self conscious appearance behaviour point existence outer world make cringe big disgusting ugly man baby walking around waste oxygen one thing worry possibility get worse become suicidal idea scare shit apparently headed make serious change lead life believe chose depressed

My mental health is taking over my life,"I live alone 4 hours away from my family attending college for biology and microbiology. I’m going into my senior year and my classes are harder than they’ve ever been. On top of that I’m suicidal. I’ve dealt with suicide attempts as a teen but haven’t had ideations in over 6 years so I’m terrified. I’m up here alone, going through a breakup, my parents are going through a rough patch in their marriage and my best friends mom just got diagnosed with cancer and my therapist just went on a two month leave so I literally have nobody I am comfortable reaching out for help at this time. I can’t get any school done because my entire day consists of bawling and anxiety attacks, i am in such a bad place and i honestly just want to die. I’ve been considering going to an impatient treatment center as i have done that about 5 times as a teen when things got so bad i couldn’t handle it on my own anymore but i know if i do it will cause me to fail every class i’m in and i will be stuck in this situation another semester and out thousands of dollars. I feel so incredibly stuck. I am so isolated because of covid, i don’t get to see my friends much, classes are cut to about an hour a day if that in person and i’m barely working. I get almost no social interaction and it’s really getting to me. This time of year is always hard but the isolation and stress of school and a breakup and this goddamn year in general is just pushing me further than I can handle. I feel like my mental health is getting out of my control, i want control of my life again and i feel like it is controlling every aspect. I really want to live but i’m scared i will get to the point where the intrusive suicidal thoughts turn into more. I’m scared, i’m alone and i am stuck. I’m really doing my best to just get through the semester but I don’t know how to, i just don’t have the motivation and just existing is exhausting, my responsibilities make me feel like i’m drowning. I’m just terrified and i feel so fucking alone. I don’t know how to stop things from getting worse and I promise you i’m doing my best but i am in a constant war with myself right now. I just want my life back, i don’t want to feel like this anymore. It just feels so unfair, i thought i was doing so well up until this year. I stopped self harming years ago and haven’t seriously thought about suicide is years, i’ve been in therapy and going to a great school for something so hard, i was so proud of where i was but now i hate myself for being back here.

I am so exhausted with life.,"I am a 22 year old dude and I have had a rough life, and it somehow manages to just get worse and worse. I am so incredibly lonely. I wake up in tears every single day, and I just dread everything. I have been depressed for 6 years, but it just hurts so much nowadays. I have severe anxiety so talking to people is a struggle. I moved to a new town to live with my brother, hoping that it would solve some of my issues and maybe I would feel like life would be worth living. Well me and him do not talk at all anymore because there's really no point. We see each other maybe a minute or two every day and that's it. We do not talk anymore so I basically moved to a new town and lost a friend. I have one friend who lives an hour away from me but we barely talk nowadays. I have no family. I have nobody to talk to at all and it just hurts so much. I have a kitchen job but nobody talks to me at all because I'm just incapable of holding a conversation and I'm not an interesting person. My life has revolved around being depressed for so long now and I don't know how much longer I can go. I've had a few suicide attempts in the past which lead me to being hospitalized, but it solved nothing. I've been on multiple medications, and they just made me want to die even more. I got diagnosed with bipolar disorder earlier this year, and just left it at that and didn't try to get treatment for it. I have tried my whole teenage and adult life to make my life better, but nothing works. I am so incredibly unhappy all the time, I cry because I'm so lonely. I lost interest in any hobby I've ever had. I graduated high school and never pursued any education after that. I have nothing going for me and it just hurts to think about it at all. I just want it to end already. I wish things would change and I felt like I had a purpose in life, but there's just no way that's going to happen. I have suffered for so long and have nothing to show for it. It has taken me two weeks to make a post about this hoping for some life changing advice or something, I don't know. I just wish it would all just go away somehow, but that's being unrealistic.

Desperation,"I feel like I’m drowning, flailing wildly as I sink deeper and deeper into apathy, wondering what happened to make me so detached. I’m reaching out, but I can’t find a hand to guide me back to reality. Everything i do is a fight against myself, my thoughts switching rapidly between memories and plans, but never being quite sure which is which until it’s already moved on.
This isn’t a way to live, it’s not something I would wish on the worst person on the planet. The melancholy biting at me, but even it doesn’t get through the lack of emotion, the lack of care, the lack of attachment.
All I want is to feel something, is that so much to ask? Why can’t I feel anything? Why am I content with sitting in my home, not acknowledging anything that’s going on around me, only looking forward to the end? It’s not like I’m sick, I’m not dying so the end is a ways away, right? Maybe I’ve accepted the inevitable, maybe the futility of life has changed me.
What’s my reason for living if there is no meaning or order to my life? I’m just a collection of tiny little cells, endlessly dividing without my input, always interacting with the single directional flow of time. The pain never heals, though. The cells only continue to die in increasingly alarming numbers.
Chronic pain is all I feel. Even after surgery 3 years back that was meant to fix the pain, was meant to make it go away, I still feel it. My arm feels like it’s on fire constantly. Maybe I’ll be happier if it’s gone I think. Maybe I’ll actually be able to sleep again if it’s gone.
I’m too young to be dealing with chronic pain, so why am I? Why won’t my body heal? Why aren’t we at a place where we can replace limbs with robotics that function just as well so that those of us cursed with unending pain can have an escape without giving up functionality?

Has anyone been in a relationship with someone as depressed as them?,"I've had depression for 10 years. My boyfriend has had it for just as long. We're both in our twenties now, and in a really healthy and loving relationship. He's a little older and better at expressing himself. I have learned to trust one person (my best friend). I'm open, but it's really hard for me to speak up about my problems. I'm working on it. 

It sort of feels like whenever he's on the verge of a breakdown, or having a bad day, I am putting my own problems aside to care for him. It's all on my own accord, and I hide it really well so I don't think he knows what's going on. 

I was on medication for a year at the highest dosage and all it did was make me feel physically sick so I stopped taking it all together. I want to start therapy again. To be honest, I saw a therapist at age 12 and he ended up dying a year later. I never wanted to go to another one. 

I brought up couples therapy once when I couldn't put my mental aside, and couldn't adequately take care of him because of it. He's not fond on that idea. I think it would be a good way for us to help each other, especially since both of us are no longer on medication.

Has anyone ever had a partner with the same mental health issues? Any advice for us? 

We love each other very much, it's just a little difficult when we both are having an episode.",serpentine01,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxp5h3/has_anyone_been_in_a_relationship_with_someone_as/,depression 10 year boyfriend ha long twenty really healthy loving relationship little older better expressing learned trust one person best friend open really hard speak problem working sort feel like whenever verge breakdown bad day putting problem aside care accord hide really well think know going wa medication year highest dosage wa make feel physically sick stopped taking together want start therapy honest saw therapist age 12 ended dying year later never wanted go another one brought couple therapy put mental aside adequately take care fond idea think would good way u help especially since u longer medication ha anyone ever partner mental health issue advice u love much little difficult episode,ha anyone relationship someone depressed,serpentine 01,1328,68,serpentine 01 depression 10 year boyfriend ha long twenty really healthy loving relationship little older better expressing learned trust one person best friend open really hard speak problem working sort feel like whenever verge breakdown bad day putting problem aside care accord hide really well think know going wa medication year highest dosage wa make feel physically sick stopped taking together want start therapy honest saw therapist age 12 ended dying year later never wanted go another one brought couple therapy put mental aside adequately take care fond idea think would good way u help especially since u longer medication ha anyone ever partner mental health issue advice u love much little difficult episode ha anyone relationship someone depressed

Idk if I should seek help and idk what I feel,"Hello,  rn I have alot of problems in my life (I guess that that is relative maybe, but there is/ are big problem(s) ). I thought about going to seek help, but then I also think, ohh you are just overexegerating. Though there are some problems I will have to fix myself, actually all of them because change starts with myself. I have periods where I feel ok-ish I think, like right before switching universities for example, because it was needed and I was outside alot then and being ok I guess.

I'm kinda scared to go seek help and they just say; you're just overexegerating or smth, idk why I think that. Because idk if I really have it bad, idk when I have it that bad, that I need to search help I guess?

I struggle alot with university rn, I have exams, but I am not doing anything (not studying). I don't feel like I wanna do this anymore even though I have switched  2 times already, I got one thing I wanna do tho, but that still needs work and I can't start with doing that fulltime atm. (but I will achieve my goal one day)

I also got bad medical news about a family member...

I overthink every aspect of life almost, I tend to lose interest in things by doing that too, because I think what is even the point in this?

I don't go outside very much, but some periods I do.

I feel easily irritable and kinda unstable sometimes maybe. (like I hop around to different feelings maybe idk)

Most of my day is spent in my bedroom.

I also feel like I am super sensitive.

And I have no real life friends anymore atm, also because I need to find people on the same wavelength.

And it looks like when alot of stress is around I search an escape in things that aren't that good (not drugs tho).

All in all: Idk what I really feel... and it feels like it goes on for a long period, then it goes off for a little and then it comes back (I'm not sure tho, cuz it could be cause I had to choose a new uni and that could have just felt like it was ok)

And as you can see I can't say things for sure, because I overthink it... and idk what I feel

I imagine a fake woman.,"At night in my bed, when I feel extremely depressed or have suicidal thoughts.

I sometimes think of and imagine a woman

Taller than me,

Stronger than me,

Long hair,

Emotionally mature,

I imagine her cuddling me in her arms, sometimes basically spooning me.

I feel cozy under the sheets.

I imagine her talking to me,

Comforting me,

Telling me that everything will be okay,

Slipping away all my worries.

Telling me reasons as to why I'm suicidal and depressed.

Telling me that its okay if I feel crazy.

Telling me that its okay that I can no longer remember anything from my past.

Because it doesn't matter when she's here.

Because she loves me...

And she will never let me be harmed again..



I sometimes turn around to try and hug her back.


I want to make her feel like I care.

Then I feel nothing.

My arms whiff and hit the pillow.

Back to being alone.

And realizing the existential dread of my fate.

What im fated to always be and what ill end up being.


Alone and Insane, until I commit suicide in an alleyway.. or die from shooting myself..

An existence that was pointless,

And a personality just as worthless...


Because why do I exist just to suffer...",Purple_Jr,9,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxiu0l/i_imagine_a_fake_woman/,night bed feel extremely depressed suicidal thought sometimes think imagine woman taller stronger long hair emotionally mature imagine cuddling arm sometimes basically spooning feel cozy sheet imagine talking comforting telling everything okay slipping away worry telling reason suicidal depressed telling okay feel crazy telling okay longer remember anything past matter love never let harmed sometimes turn around try hug back want make feel like care feel nothing arm whiff hit pillow back alone realizing existential dread fate im fated always ill end alone insane commit suicide alleyway die shooting existence wa pointless personality worthless exist suffer,imagine fake woman,purple jr,1187,23,purple jr night bed feel extremely depressed suicidal thought sometimes think imagine woman taller stronger long hair emotionally mature imagine cuddling arm sometimes basically spooning feel cozy sheet imagine talking comforting telling everything okay slipping away worry telling reason suicidal depressed telling okay feel crazy telling okay longer remember anything past matter love never let harmed sometimes turn around try hug back want make feel like care feel nothing arm whiff hit pillow back alone realizing existential dread fate im fated always ill end alone insane commit suicide alleyway die shooting existence wa pointless personality worthless exist suffer imagine fake woman
I am a failure.,"I think this time I’m just going to give the complete unabridged version, in detail, even the things I’ve done wrong. If you hate me, hate me. I’m no saint, I’ve done my fair share of hurting and toxicity. I deserve my place in hell, I won’t deny it. If you’re easily offended, disturbed, or want to criticize me, save it and scroll.

When I was a kid (7?) my dad dipped out for cigarettes and that was that, there’s probably damage there but fuck him, I’ve dragged myself into homeownership at 25 on my own. When I was 15 my mom passed away of cancer. I know that fucked my head up, I know I’m not normal, I know my heart doesn’t operate like everyone else’s. In the words of Papa Roach, I’ve got a jet black heart, it’s all fucked up and it’s falling apart. 

When I finally got through the bullying and harassment that comes with growing up and graduating in Yee-Yee country I tried to go to College, god damn that was a terrible choice cause I didn’t try, I was forced into it. I wanted to take my inheritance and buy a house my “family” talked me out of it. I met this girl we’ll call her L. She was the first nail in my coffin. L told me how much she liked me, we slept together, skipped classes and smoked pot, let it be known, I did this so much I don’t remember what I went to college for. One day, a truth came out, I was the side piece, there was hell to pay, not from her but from my liver, famous words of mine “Jack straight, no chaser, none of that pussy shit.” This wasn’t shots, this was straight from the bottle, lean back and chug all weekend till you don’t feel shit but your body collapse to the ground. 

Weed, acid, alcohol became my life until late 2016, I had lost my license cause weed is “bad” but I met a girl, we’ll call her N. Fuck where do I begin? She was amazing at the time, I loved N, but she didn’t like weed, and even though it helps my depression, she wouldn’t have it eventually we broke up, I then proceeded to save money to buy a house, I drank, fucked, snorted, and tripped my way through 2018-2019. In the words of Oli Sykes, This shit ain’t heavy metal. Do you even love me anymore? 

It’s 2019, and god damn these cracks are starting to show, I started seeing a girl at work, her name was A. Fuck A. I hope she suffers a fate worse than death. A went through some stuff before us, she gave up a baby. but she felt the closest I had felt to home in so long. I trusted her, Alligator Tears, there is no soul inside that wretch. She lied, manipulated, and stabbed me in the back. Told me she thought she was pregnant knowing damn well she wasn’t, fucked another dude, and ran off with him, all while telling me how great I was. She drove me to the bathtub with a knife, a camera, and a bottle of vodka. I recorded the whole thing, she did this, she was going to watch the consequences for her choices. I’m no saint, I’m the god damn villain. 

A couple months after that, another girl came along, things were great until one day, she broke up with me and all she had to say for herself was “ I’m the asshole, you didn’t do anything wrong.” I swore from that moment, in 2020 I was going to find my person, I was going to get my happy ending cause at this point I don’t feel like I can be loved.

It’s 2020, N came back and you know what she had to say for herself after I drove an hour out of the way to go see her and cheer her up with a blowing up engine after she got left, We talk off and on and one day she tells me, “I’m sorry the spark isn’t there anymore, I’m dating a drug dealer now, isn’t that funny.” I was so enraged. I burnt everything she ever gave me that I held onto. Burnt it all to the ground. Fuck you. 

My birthday is in two days and what do I have to show for my goal, my New Years resolution to move on and start my next chapter, to let go and do all the shit I miss like cuddling and going on adventures? I’m not shit too anyone, no one puts in time to get to know me, I know I don’t operate the same way, I know I shoot straight and will tell you day one, we aren’t friends, I’m only here to date. I know what I want but it doesn’t matter, no fucks are given, my feelings don’t matter, if I get hurt, good do it, the thing that she really wants is right around the corner, Stab me in the back and slit my throat, let the blood run down my neck, according to the universe I deserve this hell. I don’t want to hurt people, I just want my person cause A got hers and she left me to die. Karma didn’t rip everything from her.

Hate me, I know I’m fucked In the head. there’s no advice to give, Wait my turn, be patient, it’s just not my time. I’ve heard it all before. Fuck that, if it’s not my time A better be losing everything soon.",JesustheSpaceCowboy,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxy9py/i_am_a_failure/,think time going give complete

I've spent so much of my life hating myself," I have suffered from a severe duality for a huge part of my life. One part of myself really loves life and finds beauty in the simple things, while the other side just wants to see me suffer. It's been torture, and exhausting. It finally came to a pretty severe crossroads for me and has led me to a new journey for myself. I wanted to share my story, and this journey so I laid it out in a 4 part podcast which can be found below. I appreciate everyone on here sharing their stories. It takes so much strength to ask for help.

Broken Day,"I'm exhausted, been dealing with my depression ""white knuckled"" for a bit finally got on meds again and back in therapy. Today Im so close to just breaking down. I can't seem to focus on any positive and it really sucks I just opened up to my wife about feeling like I have to compete for her attention and I thought airing it out would make it easier but it hasn't I'm not mad about it I'm just super fucking down now that it's been said out loud. We had plans to see friends tonight (people we are already in close contact daily). I can't focus on anything other than how miserable I feel and just want to bail because I'm sure I'm gonna be a bundle of joy. However I know that if I start cancelling plans and shutting people out things spiral very quickly. The thought of seeing friends in a relaxed setting should make me feel better but meh I could take it or leave it. My wife really doesn't understand how I'm feeling. She understands the diagnosis and the treatment. However she doesn't know the gut wrenching sadness for no other reason than the sake of it being present, or that on good days it has no effect but on days like today it makes the task of taking a shower seem like trying to push a boulder uphill. I feel like the boulder might actually take less energy at this point. I know we all deal with this and the way I'm feeling isn't new to anyone here.

Workaholic family,"I just wanted to share as I don't know anyone to talk to. I have been recently in home all-time due to covid and I never interacted with my family before and always was in the hostel during school and college as I had an abusive childhood. Now that I slowly started talking to the family I realize that my mom is so concentrated on her work and doesn't care for me. I fall sick often. I asked her to take me to the hospital, but she doesn't seem to care and concentrates on her work. I just suffer from the pain and don't show it outside.  Even my dad used to be a workaholic and never came home, I don't even have any memories of him. The second time I saw him was a week before he passed away. So I never really felt any comfort from family. My mom did another marriage, but my stepfather is also an alcoholic who drinks all the time and doesn't speak much. I don't have any friends to share even. They feel so much like strangers to me that I can't even talk about anything to my family about anything. I have been diagnosed with OCD for which I haven't been able to get treatment as no one is ready to help me in my family. I just don't know what to do and I'm afraid that I would turn out to be similar to them. I'm feeling so depressed. There are always fights in my home and I can't concentrate on my studies which is really the one thing I can do and keeps me going.  I just feel like running away from home as I can't any motivation to do anything further in my life and sometimes I feel that it's better to die than suffer every day. I feel like I am stuck in my past. It would be helpful if you can share any similar experience with a workaholic and how you overcame it.

My bf doesnt understand Im struggling (venting but wouldnt mind advice),"I go to his house every weekend and I can never get my school work done before I go over. I feel bad because it is supposed to be our time together but every time I try to start doing my work, no matter how good of a mood I am in, I just can't. I just sit there and stare at the screen and feel overwhelmed and lost.

He always comments about having none of my work done and how I don't work so I have so much free time when I really don't. Just like anyone else parents, they ask you to help around the house and everything else. I want to do stuff for myself like play games or do little projects.

I've tried to explain that I have a hard time starting my work and focusing on it but he kind of just dismisses it because his mom did college online and he did high school online so it shouldn't be hard because it wasn't hard for him. Except I'm not him or his mom, his mom has the drive to do work, she was taking those online classes to keep her job.

How to solve problems with relationships?,"  

Hi everyone,

I am an 18-year-old boy graduating from high school this year. To make it easier for you to understand my problem, I will summarize my story.

I managed to get into the best secondary school in the whole province. I met new people quickly and I got assimilated. I really like science subjects, such as mathematics or computer science. I don't like the humanities, so I don't put too much effort into it, but the teachers like me because I often help them with the Office software.

However, I do not like how the school affects the atmosphere at home. I remember that since I crossed the threshold of elementary school, I was rewarded for bringing a good grade, but for any failures in education my parents responded with distance, they often told me I was stupid and I would not achieve anything in my life. They often ridiculed me at family gatherings and scored the smallest of offenses with a precision worthy of Sherlock Holmes. It was embarrassing but, in such case, I used to go out with my cousins and play with them. It still hurt, but the joy of meeting them overshadowed the feeling of rejection.

In secondary school, I learned to draw with colorful drawing inks. Since I can remember, I've liked people, but I feel the best spending time at my desk equipped with ink, pencils, and terrible amounts of paper :) I remember that one of my first successful drawings was a portrait of Steve Clark, guitarist of Def Leppard. I showed this drawing to my dad, he reacted: ""You would learn English better instead of drawing crap"". It hurt me. Evaluation of the drawing is a subjective thing, and this one was technically OK because I have already mastered the proportions. He might not have liked it anyway but I was saddened because he didn't even look at it and he got pissed off because I boasted about something unrelated to the school.

Before the secondary school final exams, I was scared by my parents that I wouldn't pass them and it would be a miracle if they accepted me to a vocational school. I was happy and angry with my parents when it turned out that I had one of the best results in the province.

In turn, I have often heard from my mother that I should be grateful for her dedication. I always thanked her for preparing meals - it costs nothing and is very nice. However, she sometimes blamed me for not guessing that I was supposed to vacuum the room or something like that. I never knew what to answer, so I offered her to give me a vacuum cleaner, and then I could do it for her. Usually, then I heard that I was hopeless and I could not be counted on.

And here is the first problem: I can't deal with problems that are connected with emotions. I can solve a purely technical problem, write a program, whatsoever, but I will ignore the feelings of others because they tire me out, suck the energy I need to find a solution. How to deal with such a situation? I will be grateful for advice or links to helpful articles.

Let’s go for the blow. The first crisis happened shortly after high school has begun. Despite keeping in touch with classmates, I felt incredibly lonely and unwanted by anyone (my parents…?). Then I started to hear from them every day that if I don't pass the final exams, they will kick me out and I won't go to any studies. I felt so damn anxious this time! I lost interest in everything else then, and after getting ready for school, I spent the rest of my time lying in bed or watching anime on my laptop.

And I think this is where I made a mistake because I spent a month plunging into a negative internal dialogue. I don't want to blame any of my parents, but it was probably influenced by my mother who is very neurotic and start “solving” any problem by weaving black scenarios instead of facing up the difficulties.

I came back to drawing and playing the guitar. I threw away books, movies, and games because not only did they not give me joy but also had negative associations as a tool to escape from the world. Instead, I prefer walking in the woods, drawing more, and playing guitar instead of just soaking up the content.

I am very hurt by my parents' lack of support. I know a lot of people who love to discuss with me about drawing, math, modeling in Blender, or writing code. I meet passionate and warm people on my way.

But none of these people are members of my family!

I feel rejected by my parents. I often recall the words of my mother who said that I was a planned child but still regrets that she gave birth to me. How can I accept rejection? How to build a happy relationship with my parents despite being hurt?

The parents' behaviors for sure is due to the fact that my mother is the child of an alcoholic and was beaten by her mother. Also, my dad grew up practically alone because my grandparents took care of my uncle who was hit by a car. What can I advise them to help themselves?

I know that I am not responsible for two adults, but so far no one has taken the step to build a healthy family relationship. When I go to visit my friends, I always have the opportunity to spend some time with their parents and most of them are really cool people who treat me... like a human being. I probably have an incomplete picture of the situation - after all, I do not live there. However, I have never encountered such a cold as at my family home.

In early September I met a girl. She caught my eye so I asked her culturally... Well, I was supposed to have a lesson but we talked to each other for a good half hour. X is a very empathic person who shares interests and worldview with me. I see her not only as a partner but also as a best friend. She says that she likes staying with me. She says that she wants to meet me and that I am important to her. She is 4 years younger but still very emotionally mature. Officially, we are not a couple, but X lets me touch her and hold her hand, also she takes me into account in her plans.

I think this relationship has a chance of success. The question is what to do to build a happy relationship with her? How to work through destructive schemes and not build your own relationships based on them?

I will raise an important issue that was omitted at the beginning: why am I writing in a thread about depression? Just a month ago I didn't want to get out of bed but I felt remorse having a lot of things to do. And school. I was forced to take care of myself and to exercise. Everything that had previously given me joy became a filler between the time I spent in bed. Sometimes I felt terrible fear, I had nightmares.

I am not going to play self-diagnosis. Unfortunately, because of the lockdown, so far, I have no way to go to a psychologist, I can start thinking about it next year. Lithium orotate helped me to return to normal activities, thanks to it I can sleep and I do not have panic attacks. Earlier I took Xanax, which I accidentally found in the first aid kit, for my sleep and anxiety problems. It was irresponsible and unethical (after all, one of the family members needed this medicine and I used it up... I don’t know who) but I felt so crushed by the fear that I took those pills in my darkest moments.

I never wanted or tried to kill myself but I can't handle my emotions. I know that they are needed but it is painful for me to experience them. I want to cry, but I can't. As soon as a tear comes out of my eyes I can hear my father's voice in my head ""Don't cry like a woman"".

But pills are not the solution. I know where the problem lies. In my sick family relationships. The question is, what can I do until I go to the psychologist? How can I cope when exercise, keeping a diary, diet and walks do not improve my mood? How do I deal with the feeling of rejection?

If you have survived to this moment, I am incredibly grateful to you. These are not empty words; I really feel what I am writing. Thank you all for your help, I hope that your advice will prove helpful. Take care of yourself.

Wired to be hard on myself,"Everyone that loves me tells me I need to not be so hard on myself and just enjoy the things I like to do at the level of skill that I'm currently at.

But I wish to be better at what I love to do so in order to keep from becoming laxidazical I get extreamly hard on myself and argue with people why I dont even deserve to ever get good at what im trying to get good at. But the being hard on myself may also be what's been holding me back from achieving what I'm trying to achieve.

I need some advice guys,"Hey everyone, so as my name suggests I'm a hungarian guy struggling with some dark things lately. It might not seem a big deal at first, and I'm sure there are people, who goes through tougher times, but this shit makes me lose my mind almost. Disclaimer: sorry, if my english is broken here and there, hungarian is my first language

So I have a friend, who happens to be a girl, and I caught deep feelings for her. When we first started talking, I didn't make anything of it, because I was interested in someone else, and I looked at her as someone way above my category (yeah I struggle with self esteem badly).  
A solid half a year went by and we estabilished a great friendship. I got turned off by this other girl and she helped me cope with this, she was really helpful. As we talked, I wouldn't say I developed feelings for a while, I sometimes thought about her, but nothing much.  
There was a turning point around april of 2019. We have a same circle of friends, because we study in the same university, and after a night of drinking she made out (only kissing) with another guy, and it turned out, she caught feelings for the guy. Now that wasn't the turning point itself, but when we talked about it after. She mentioned that the main reason, she fell in love with him, is that he cared about her so much during the exam period. Now that very sentence flipped the tables as I felt that I was the one who cared about her the most.

I had the reason to think this. You must know that she is a very interesting character, and because she is the first person of this kind that I ever encountered I learned a lot because of her. Since we first started talking, she always presented a heartbreakingly low self esteem (like she always said she is fat, nobody likes her, she is not enough) and I always wrote like long texts explaining why she isn't right, she really valuable and looks amazing. I was SIMPing really hard haha (and as I said, because she was the first person of this kind that I've ever met, I thought this is the way to handle stuff like this, to compliment her). I didn't know at the time, that too much SIMPing is a huge turnoff for like more than half of girls. So I got frustrated, when she said she fell in love with the other guy because of his caring, because I felt like I was the one who was always there for her, why can't she love.

And this is where it started to go downhill for me personally. I started to develop deeper and deeper feelings for her, while she was complaining about the other guy not wanting her. She made out with another guy during this, which made suffer increasingly. At that period I still didn't know how to really conquer her heart so I kept just being as nice and caring as I can be.

Now it's time to mention her attitude towards me. She was really really kind and caring for like the first year, always asking me about stuff, and as I'm a huge motorsports fan, and I told her that I watch x race and She asked like questions, She seemed to be interested. We talked about all kinds of stuff and we talked like all day long. When I had a thougher depressed episode, and for example I wasn't online for half a day, She asked in the chat like really anxiously If I'm doing ok. While I fell in love in her increasingly She made it even deeper with that kind of caring. I was really happy when I talked with her. Along the way though, I made some mistakes, which made her lost a bit of interest and caring. Like when she was excited about some celebrity gala, I hadn't show that kind of interest that she showed for my motorsport stuff. The other example was that, when I go home from a drinking night out, she always texted me that ""Text me, when you got home safe"" and I texted this a couple of times to her too, but there were one occasion when I forgot to do it, and it felt really bad for her, I hurt her with that. There were some other smaller ones too. Since these incidents she hasn't show this kind of caring, and I miss it soooo terribly much I can't even explain.

So back to the main part, and this is where it gets ""exciting"". She did a thing that is absolutely unacceptable to me. The main story is that she got to know a guy twice her age, who is a married family man, with two kids. The guy is a frickin bad person, he told her that yea he cheats on her wife, but his wife knows about it and she is okay with that. Yeah, give me a break, who believes this kind of bullshit. Well, my friend did, and this guy lied his way into her, and they've been having sex regularly ever since. Now when before it all happened, and I tried to warn her, that it is really not good to do something like this, because if you take part in cheating, is really immoral I think (I know what I'm talking about, my last relationship ended because I got cheated on). When I tried to warn her, that this guy is not honest, I was attacked brutally, and we can say very toxically. She said that I'm judging her, I'm complaining about her happiness and shit. I said this is not the case, I just think she got misled, and taking part in cheating is really bad. But she kept on saying that Its not about that, this is perfectly fine, why I call out her when other do the same and shit. I was extremely disappointed in her, and I was also unsuprisingly  frustrated that she chooses this fuckin cheater instead of me. She eventually caught feelings for this freakin fella, and although there were some red flags, she wouldn't let him go.

So at this point I started to feel like I might lose interest, which I thought is good. She had some arguments about her f-ed up relationship but eventually we didn't really talked about it after a while. I felt I have the chance that I could let her go, and my feelings for her. But guess what, after all of this shit, I just caught feelings for her again, and even more deeply. I absolutely can not figure out how and why, because she wasn't that caring anymore what I loved about her and she was still in this situation with the married guy. In this summer my feelings were the deepest, and dont laugh at me, but I started to watch like how to get out of friendzone videos and stuff. We joke a lot, so I sometimes threw in like a flirty joke and it didn't really work out well. She seemed like she started to move away from me, and we talked about whats wrong, and she said I made her uncomfortable at times, and of course, she said the flirty joke examples. From this particular argument although I got out better, because she handled the whole conflict in a really childish way, like when I said we should talk she gave excuses because like how i framed a sentence and shit, and I eventually lost interest talking it through. After a couple of days tho, she texted me, and we talked ever since.

But the problem just cant go away, I have really really deep feelings for her. And along the way I got really depressed because of this. I realized that in the beginning I should have gave it a shot, and we might have started dating at the time. I should have given her more excitment and interest in those incidents back in the day. I shouldn't have SIMPed that much. And as I realized my mistakes, I'm really mad at myself. I'm a person who is full of anxiety, so it takes an extra toll on me. I just love her so much man, I cant even describe. I know, that the caring and loving person is not lost, but she only shows it to the person, who she is in love with, and this frustrates me so much. I know I made some mistakes, I know i was the so called nice guy, who nobody wants, and I know that I should just look for another woman, but I just cant right now, I dont really find anyone attractive anymore other than her. So i have some questions, in which I need advice for badly, because I feel like I'm starting to lose my mind, these feelings eats away me.

1. What should I do to get out of the friendzone with her (if there is a tactic, which can give me hope, just please tell me)
2. If there is no hope whatsoever, then please tell me how to cope with it.
3. How can i get back her caring and interest, if its possible?
4. What should I change, that this shit never happens to me again?
5. Please give me feedback on the whole story, and tell me where I fucked up, or the thing I didn't noticed on the way, or that I was wrong somewhere.

Sorry for the long story, but I thought there might be some people that can help me, and give me hope. I really love her.

My Current Situation (Vent),"I could go through my entire life story, but that'd be ridiculous so I'll just explain what's been going on recently.

I recently got into a pretty bad argument with my mother. It was a whole lot of bullshit and she was just being an asswipe and overreacting as usual. And I'm not just saying that. But anyway, after that I went and locked myself in my bedroom for the rest of the day. 1 day turned into 2. 2 turned into 3, and here I am, typing away on my keyboard in my bedroom. I've only left my bedroom for minimal food and water to keep me alive, dinner (after everyone finishes so I can eat alone), and to piss and shit. Food isn't even appealing to me anymore. I don't even care to eat and I just see feces when I look in my fridge. I'm used to a grumbling stomach at this point. Haven't seen daylight in 3 days. Just been jerking off, sleeping, listening to music, browsing Reddit and YouTube, and watching livestreams, wasting my life away. I'm on my fall break in college right now so I don't have to worry about homework right now. But well, what 'inspired' me to write this is that I was in my bedroom and somehow managed to grasp the energy to workout slightly just to keep my body from withering away, and I overheard my dickhead mother talking to my fuckface brother about how I've been locked away in my room all day and that I keep doing this. You know what they said? They said all of these rough quotes:

""He keeps waking up at 6 PM and I can never get the bedroom to myself, it's so annoying"" (I share a bedroom with my brother). - brother

""I'm so sick of his shitty sleep schedule"" - mother

And they a couple other douchy things but im forgetting unfortunately. But either way, what really got my attention was that neither one of them seemed concerned whatsoever about my condition. None of them wondered why I was waking up late and locking myself in my bedroom, none of them wondered why I haven't been saying a word at dinner, and none of them have checked on me ONCE. I was just about to grasp the courage to leave my bedroom and grab some food, but I think I'm gonna sit here and starve now. Fuck these people. I can't believe I'm gonna be stuck with these people for several more years.

Distracting myself barely even helps. I was on voicechat with friends laughing my ass off yesterday, and the moment I got off I immediately felt empty and depressed again. Even my dreams lately have been shit, and they're usually alright. My dreams all consisted of the events that went down recently. Music has been keeping me sane, I have songs infinitely playing so that I don't have dark thoughts to make me want to die even more than I already do.

My family knows full well that im depressed and they dont even give a fucking shit. Oh and my mom told me 3 days ago that I'm an asshole and that I disgust her, so there's that. Thanks mom, you really make me feel loved. Maybe you'll regret what you said when I finally get pushed over the fucking edge one day and tie a noose.

I genuinely don't care anymore at all.,"I'm not happy or sad. Whatever happens happens. I'm neutral most of the times. It's all whatever to me. It gets irritating having to put on an act in front of others just so I seem like a normal person others would want to be around with.

I'm saving up money so I can move from my family and not have to do it anywhere besides work and college where I have to for survival. Whether my friendships work out, if someone is interested its all the same. I'll go out or I won't, the outcome is always the same.

A lifetime of bullying and emotional abuse has caused me to be an asshole. I didn't even acknowledge it until someone pointed it out to me today.

I fell into depression because of a wrong decision,"Simply speaking, I don't like what I'm doing right now. I know it's wrong to do something that we don't like, but I don't have other choice.

Too much in my life,"In the past 72 hours, far too much has gone on in my life.

I was used as a literal punching bag by my (now) ex-fiancee for the 2nd time in our relationship, I moved out immediately and went back to live with my family, I am now in the process of getting a protection order against her, and I changed my phone number.

Every waking moment since what happened on Tuesday evening/Wednesday morning, I feel like I'm always looking over my shoulder, and I have the sinking feeling in my stomach that the moment she gets served, something bad is going to happen to me.

With all of this going on, I feel like a monster for having to take these precautionary steps and I don't understand why, even knowing I never once laid a hand on her since we've been together.

I just feel broken, and like a punching bag, and a doormat.

I feel like i've wasted a year and some change on someone who I thought was ""the one"" and I don't know if I will ever be able to find my someone...

I’ve been to great lengths trying to run from my depression...,"I’ve been depressed since 15. I grew up in an absolutely broken and abusive home in the middle of no where. I’ve been punched in the face for crying by my mom, and well also by myself. I’m a runner. I ran to college, then I ran even further, overseas. I’ve traveled all around the world. I’ve lived in 4 countries. I worked so so hard to get where I am now, a small island in SE Asia because I fell in love with it 5 years ago, but sometimes when you get to your biggest dreams, you realize it’s not at all what you want. I live with my boyfriend, who is a native of the island. He’s just an asshole. We rarely even talk. He’s unemployed and I really think I’m being used for money. I spend at least 98% of my week alone inside my home as I also work from home. There aren’t many expats here and the depression spell I’ve been in the past few years is so much different than anything I’ve had before. I’m completely numb and sometimes I even miss waking up and feeling the heaviness on my chest as at least then I felt alive. I have 2 friends here, but neither are close enough to even know I’m so depressed. I feel so lost. I’m only 27, but see no future for my life as I feel so stuck here. I’m responsible for so many people (financially) that I shouldn’t even hold responsibility for, yet no one takes care of me. So many people from my little town are so proud of me. They think I’m so brave and adventurous, but really I’m just running. It doesn’t matter where in the world I am, the darkness never leaves, of course by what people see they would never ever know the state I’ve been in for so long. I want to leave here all of the time, but when I realize i don’t have a home anywhere else in the world to return to, I panic. I recieve loads of “wow I’m so jealous of your life” messages all of the time and all I ever want to say back is, “I visualize hanging myself from the wood beams of my ceiling every. single. day”. 

I know I sound like such a spoiled privileged brat. I wish I was, but I’ve brought myself to every place I’ve ever been by hard work and my fucking brain will never even let me feel proud or content, let alone happy. I’ve just settled on the conclusion that I’m certainly the problem and no one will ever be able to love me through my depression.

Am I depressed?,"I don’t know too much about depression and what it’s like. I always thought that it meant that you are sad all the time. But lately, somehow my habits have changed and I don’t feel like myself. Things like showering, getting dressed, going out, making phone calls seem really overwhelming. I just don’t feel like doing it. I go a week without showering and it makes me feel ashamed and gross. It’s affecting my sex life with my fiancé because I don’t feel sexy anymore. I’ve gained weight, stopping eating healthy and working out. I never want to do anything. The hardest part is I don’t know where or how it all went wrong. There’s nothing that made me sad or feel like life means nothing. Generally I am very happy with my life. I like my job and my relationship was great, so how did I get like this? Now that I have all these hygiene and motivation issues I am starting to feel depressed I think. I don’t feel good about myself, I’m really insecure with my appearance.

It's exhausting,"When I was young I had friends. People I cared about and people I loved. Getting old sucks because looking back you realize how many people you once had in your life. Now most of them are gone.Some dead, some you just lost connection. I don't know whose at fault. Was it me ? was it them? who stopped reaching out ??? and that's another thing. I swear some people are hypocrites it's saddening. And I know people are not mind readers and I don't expect them to be. But some people will say stuff like, 'let's do this again' 'don't be a stranger' oh and this one's my favorite 'please reach out' They tell you to reach out and they pretend like they're actually genuinely interested in connecting with you but when you do it's like you're nothing to them, Like you're intruding or somethin. Like a stranger. would've been a lot better if I didn't reach out at all. it feels so shitty like you're unwanted. that's why all this suicide prevention talk is bullshit to me. They tell you to speak up, reach out, there are people that care yada yada yada. it's all for show. Once there is someone who actually needs help everybody's gone.

Does anyone feel like they’re just putting a mask on ?,"I don’t know where to post that but...

Whenever i come home or go to bed (especially when going to bed), brief moments of the day come back to my memory but it feels like it was all fake because how I behave during the day contrasts so much with how I really feel inside.

It’s when being faced with myself that looking back it all looks like a lie, like I’ve just been putting a mask on without realising it.

I feel guilty to be so self-centered, unable to do even the simplest things, unable to just simply live life like everybody else.

I show this bubbly quirky fun personnality but it’s just the only way I can hide how insecure and unhappy I am inside.
I found someone who loves me, they want to be with me and they accept me whole but still. If I was truly authentic I’d be unhappy 100% of the time and all I’d want to do is hide and then say goodbye at night so I can go back and hide in my little world. At this stage despite the seemingly happy moments, I’m crying most of the time, unable to sleep, eat, unable to feel comfortable in anything or anywhere. How can I offer them happiness when really all I feel and all that exists within me is just pure sadness and despair ?

They ask me to keep going, to do it for them and the future we’re going to build together. They tell me there will be better days and I should hang on here but really I don’t see the point. I never have. I live life because I have to but the only thing I wish for is death. The only thing I want is to be gone. I have nothing to offer to this world or to anyone. I can’t sleep I can’t eat I can’t talk I can’t share or exchange can’t even handle a small breeze of air. All I can do is pretend hide pretend hide pretend and hide again.

I’m feeling really depressed,"My day was shit and I feeling really sad

I have a crush on this girl and I have social anxiety so it’s kinda hard for me to talk to people in person. So I dm her on Instagram about her stories and stuff and she always took a long time to reply and sometimes no reply at all. Everyone said that she isn’t interested (everyone is people from the internet) and I accepted that but I have no friends so I said to myself I’ll try to become her friend. Their was a few days she was out of school and she hates science so she dmed me first asking for the homework and I was really happy (this was last week and this week) so I was thinking that hey maybe we could be friends she went to me for help right? Well I don’t think so, we had a science test today 7th period and 6th period we both have study skills or something like that so I made the plan to ask her if she wanted to study with me. And I actually asked her which I didn’t think I would do. She then said something like I need to read for English class (we also have the same English so I know what homework we have and we had very little) so I was fine with it because she was doing other work. So I gave science a little look and moved on I then look behind me waiting to ask a teacher a question and I look at her iPad and see her writing but for English we didn’t have to write so I had a feeling something was up. I then look again and I see her talking to her friend I think asking for help about protein synthesis (that’s what out test was on) now that got me sad because she really didn’t want to study with me and I had no idea why and her friend doesn’t even take biology so why we she get help from her right? But basically that’s it I’m really sad that she really doesn’t want to talk to me and avoids me. and that’s not the only time she avoided me (I guess you can say avoid) a few other small things happened. Like does she dislike me? I already think people don’t really like me but I always thought that it’s just me saying that to myself and I’m not as bad as I think but now I do think I’m as bad as I think and it makes me really sad.

I do get out and go to work and I socialize there ( I have no problem socializing or making friends) but after that I go home and I do nothing. I've gained a lot of weight so i have been working out and trying to fix my diet but none of this is satisfying my sadness. Right before my 17th birthday I was super super sad because I felt lonely and nobody I really wanted to go party with on my bday. Most people just say go and try out a sport do something but the problem with that is I need the money from my job and balancing school, work, and sports would be tough for me. Maybe I should do it not sure. I just have no purpose in my life... I wake up do my classes then I do my homework then go to work if I have it that day and then I go to sleep.

Feeling really off- is this normal?,"For the past year or so, I have been feeling increasingly disconnected from people around me. 

Friends who I used to love, I can no longer stand to be around for long periods of time. I feel like I can’t form relationships with anyone and would always rather just be alone. 

When I look at others’ friendships and relationships they have with other people, it seems so foreign and uncomfortable to me. 

I still hang out with people, but it all feels like I’m acting to keep up appearances of normality the whole time. 

I’m really struggling to identify this feeling- I don’t even know if it’s a part of depression. I just feel so different from everyone.

Hell horn,"I've wrote

&amp;#x200B;

Blows the hell horn, red and furious

Making the bloodthirst frenzy

Unforgivable for making such bloodthirst turn to my own blood

Running now red and furious also

Hurting myself in a haze of mortal fluids, incorporating those around

Making them sick with blue but the red is all mine

It's a phantom pain and it blows everyday

When it doesn't, I hear the preparations

Anointed ghosts, come to view, and ghastly silence

Today is not the day, even though the atmosphere undeniably cries it is

Every day survived, just a marked day on the calendar

Not even one good memory since this infernal horn started blowing

It brings hell closer and won't let go

Medication question,"So, I finally hit rock bottom, going from a highly functonial depression to a crippling one in a matter of weeks. 

I finally made an appointment with my doctor, because this has to end one way or another and 'waking up dead' isn't an option apparently. 

She referred me to a psychologist, but I haven't made an appointment yet because I don't feel up to talking just now. 
She also subscribed me Venlafaxine (Efexor), starting at 37,5mg. 

I've been taking them for three days now, and I can't stop yawning. I've also read up about them and it seems really hard to quit them after you're 'better' with high chances of relapse. 

Has anyone experience with this medication? Should I ask for something else? I do need this boost, because I can't continue like this, but I don't like pills in general and these ones just scare me.

Cycles of hopelessness and guilt,"A lot has happened in 2020, as we all know too well. It's been a shit year.

To add to this: My grandmother is dying and its heartbreaking to watch my family be so distressed. I have friends who need some time away from me due to me taking my anxieties out on them when we lived together. I feel terrible and very guilty for hurting my friends when I did not realise I was doing this. I got into a relationship that I was so happy in, only to be broken up with later in the year. All solidify the thoughts in my mind that I'm a horrible mess of a person that nobody wants to be around.

My friends are all kinda growing up &amp; apart - we don't see eachother much anymore, even out of lockdown &amp; pandemic - relationships getting more serious, friends moving abroad, spending more time with their partners and on their own careers and lives. I understand it, but it doesn't make things easier. Even when it comes to my most amazing couple of friends - I can tell that they are tired of hearing my problems. I feel alone, unwanted and like people are sick of my shit. I apologise to people for even saying a sentence sometimes.

Anxiety &amp; depression have been on and off in my life like a high school couple for the last nine years, but never as strong as this. I am 28 now. I feel like I've achieved nothing. I went back to university at 23, graduated a year ago and am now doing a masters on top of my job. I can't do it. I can't even motivate myself to sit and do research.  I lie on my bed with a blanket over me watching crap shows on my days off when I knew I should be working and researching for college work, then I feel intense guilt for not being able to do it. Sometimes I feel ok and sometimes my friends want to see me. Other times I won't see anyone for a week. People are too busy for me., then I feel like I'm annoying them by asking them to meet. I've been to talk therapy, cbt and on meds over and over. I always think they work at the time, but then realise that I never really learnt much as I struggle with myself over and over. I've tried the meditation, the journaling.

I'm waking up each day since the break-up with a knot in my stomach and a beating chest. It was really the straw that broke the camel's back. I realise that i's not him I miss or I crave, but that it really just compounded all of my feelings of worthlessness. I cry too much. I can't stop eating, then sometimes my stomach growls at me but I can't bring myself to get up and cook. I am not interested in anything anymore. I have motivation for life and I hate this. I am struggling to see any positives in my life. I am experiencing psychomatic symptoms from anxiety - I have a hernia. Even simple tasks like washing clothes or showering require a lot of mental energy and a pep talk. I just want to be normal again.

I am in the middle of over-the-phone counselling, but it's not working. What type of therapy worked for people here who have experienced these type of feelings?

When you don't want to slip back into a habit.,"I'm a student. 

So, come after first 10 weeks of school,I on average take a massive dive for the worse. It's...proven itself to be a massive cycle at this point. Phrasing this is really awkward. I've had instances where I've been told it's seasonal, but it's honestly just probably tied to how my yearly schedule plays out (schooling being the typical american September to June schedule).

I'm a senior this year. I've been fighting this for a while. 10th grade (I was 15), middle school up until that point (2 1/2 years or so),my boyfriend took his life.
Right as I was getting back into my feet so to say.
I got on decent meds. Stopped being as actively anxious.

Now I'm... I'm really just apathetic. I have big weeby dreams and goals, yet I can't motivate myself to do anything. Whether it's school work or hobby based or whatever. The bar has been set so low, yet I can't bring myself to step over it. I don't want to have a breakdown or anything because then it'd feel like I'll be back in my hospitalization cycle. I don't want to act on my impluses,for I know first hand the fallout to those things.

I have an easy and good life. A good girlfriend/best friend. I'm not academically slow. Loving family. Decent financial situation.

I feel so ungrateful, Because everything is being basically handed to me.

I feel like the majority of our destinies in life are determined by our genes and I don't have any of the good ones.,"I read quick snippets of how genes influence your traits such as motivation, academics, romantic relationships, etc. I feel like this is true which really bums me out because I definitely don't have any of the good ones needed to live a successful and enjoyable life. Certain inherited genes can influence Psychological illnesses like depression too. I am 23 and have never dated, live with my mom, and I am unemployed. There is no reason for this though. I was raised in a rich family and cared for. I feel like this is Darwin's natural selection at work. Favoring certain traits over others. Taking out the weak ones like me. 

Each year I get older the percentage that I will have kids gets lower. It looks like there will be nothing carried on after me. It ends here. millions of years my ancestors carried on their legacy successfully only to have this sore loser with his fucked head from fucked genes fuck everything up.  I don't even want to kill myself anymore. I'm just going to ride this out until the better people eat me up and shoot me out of here.

I’m also pretty annoyed because I’ve lost interest in a lot of things I used to enjoy and just don’t get happy anymore really unless I’m out drinking with friends but that’s impossible at the moment with COVID-19 
I’ve done some research online and I think most of my “symptoms” point to dysthymia, now unlike some here tragically I don’t want to die or to harm myself but I have thought about it in the past yes. I also struggle with self image a lotttt I find it extremely difficult seeing all my friends with a significant other and have had 0 such relationships in my 19 years of living. I’m thinking I need to reach out to a therapist to help me or some medication or something but I’m quite scared of doing it tbh.

How do I help my boyfriend with hygiene when he’s in a depressive episode?,"So a few things for background: My boyfriend and I have been together for a year and a half and we live together. He’s had issues with depression since childhood and has been diagnosed with major depression. He IS getting help. 

A few times a year he has very serious depressive episodes, during which he can barely function. These can last from a week to a month. This is made harder by the fact that he works 60-hour weeks doing manual labor at a factory. When he gets home from work during one of these episodes he either goes to sleep immediately or will watch the same movie over and over. If I cook something and put it on a plate and bring it to him he’ll eat it, but if I don’t literally put food in front of him he won’t eat. 

I genuinely don’t mind helping him when he’s having an episode. From my perspective he is sick, and you take care of your loved ones when they’re sick. 

But one thing I haven’t been able to find a way to help him with is basic hygiene. He’ll rarely shower, or brush his teeth during his depressive spells. And these are things that I can’t take on for him while he’s struggling. Have any of you guys had success with maintaining basic hygiene while in an episode?

When I can remember about the times that I felt anything, even my greatest pain in a torture-like form, I can think something good about it: it never existed.

It is not because we think and are intelligent that we are important, this may have helped us to reach the top of the food chain but it just brought disaster like depression into our lives.

I've been on all the SSRI's that the doctors offer. I feel like either I have a weird tolerance, or all of these medications are placebos. Nothing seems to work on me and I'm not sure what to do.

I've had some trauma the last few years that I don't want to talk about now if that's ok. 
I genuinely can't see any way out other than to end my life. I haven't been happy for a long time, I've been waiting and hoping for something to change.
I know I probably sound like a self entitled horrible person but I've been trying for so long and I feel quite desperate. I am in debt but because I live with my partner I'm not entitled to any help, government wise.
I don't know what to do.

I'm sorry that this post is depressing but again I feel desperate and I don't really know what I want or am expecting by typing this all out.

"I almost killed myself over the summer, but one phone call changed everything.","
TW: SELF HARM, SUICIDE ATTEMPT
So let’s start off like this:
Hello, my name is Dora (nickname). Starting in 7th grade I started to struggle with depression, not exactly sure how it came on but it happened fast. Suddenly I went from the sweet girl who cared about everyone to being self conscious, beating myself up for not getting 100%, and just blaming myself for things I couldn’t even control. This triggered severe anxiety, which is something a 13 year old should never have to deal with. I started self harm in the 7th grade as well, I guess it was kind of a trend as weird as that sounds; in my mind it was nothing serious because everyone else was doing it so I couldn’t be that bad right? Wrong. I have so many scars and they destroyed my body image, I have to live with them forever now. Let’s skip forward to 8th grade, my depression kind of went away but my anxiety was still high. I got through the year easy, no drama, I made a ton of new friends, and was having fun until everything hit me like a train. I was suspended and I lost every last friend, my entire grade hated me. That’s when everything fell apart rapidly, my depression came back only this time it was even worse, my anxiety skyrocketed, I went from being able to bottle my emotions to being an emotional wreck and crying over the simplest of things, well I mean what else was I supposed to do? I was hated by everyone. I started self harm again, hardcore. I started planning my suicide, the day, how I would do it, and I was always perfecting it to make sure nothing goes wrong and that I won’t survive and be miserable. I decided to wait until the summer so nobody would pretend to care about me, and the only one I’d be hurting is myself. That was until I met him, (I’m going to call him Mateo for privacy), I had known Mateo since 5th grade and we were friends but when school let out our friendship sky rocketed, he was the only friend I had, and I fell in love with him. But I shouldn’t I told myself, I tried pushing him away but I didn’t back down, I tried my best to ignore him but he always caught my eye. He was helping but I didn’t know it yet, so I figured out how to push him a little so I wouldn’t worry about him being hurt over my suicide. Skip forward to June, maybe July. I was still hated by everyone and I loved Mateo but I couldn’t hold onto him, so once my family went to bed I grabbed the right pill amount and a knife. I picked up my knife and slit my wrist, then I just as I was able to down the pills Mateo called me. Something that night told me to answer besides I suppose I owed him a final goodbye, but that phone call didn’t go the way I expected. When I picked up he was really happy and went on talking about stuff, asking how I was, and bringing up fun we had during school a couple months ago. I didn’t tell him what I was doing but I threw the pills away, cleaned up my bloody wrist and layed in bed as he talked to me for the next 6 hours. In the following months I got a lot better and in fact for the first time in three years I want to live and I’m excited for the future... my future with him. That’s right, I’m still in love with him and actually he likes me too but we are taking things very slowly. Oh and btw I did tell him about that night a couple months later and he was so upset, not at me but by the fact that he could have lost me.",doragamergorl,4,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxgaq1/i_almost_killed_myself_over_the_summer_but_one/,tw self harm suicide attempt let start like hello name dora nickname starting 7th grade started struggle depression exactly sure came happened fast suddenly went sweet girl cared everyone self conscious beating getting 100 blaming thing even control triggered severe anxiety something 13 year old never deal started self harm 7th grade well guess wa kind trend weird sound mind wa nothing serious everyone else wa bad right wrong many scar destroyed body image live forever let skip forward 8th grade depression kind went away anxiety wa still high got year easy drama made ton new friend wa fun everything hit like train wa suspended lost every last friend entire grade hated everything fell apart rapidly depression came back time wa even worse anxiety skyrocketed went able bottle emotion emotional wreck cry simplest thing well mean else wa supposed wa hated everyone started self harm hardcore started planning suicide day would wa always perfecting make sure nothing go wrong survive miserable decided wait summer nobody would pretend care one hurting wa met going call mateo privacy known mateo since 5th grade friend school let friendship sky rocketed wa friend fell love told tried pushing away back tried best ignore always caught eye wa helping know yet figured push little worry hurt suicide skip forward june maybe july wa still hated everyone loved mateo hold onto family went bed grabbed right pill amount knife picked knife slit wrist wa able pill mateo called something night told answer besides suppose owed final goodbye phone call go way expected picked wa really happy went talking stuff asking wa bringing fun school couple month ago tell wa threw pill away cleaned bloody wrist layed bed talked next 6 hour following month got lot better fact first time three year want live excited future future right still love actually like taking thing slowly oh btw tell night couple month later wa upset fact could lost,almost killed summer one phone call changed everything,dora game rg orl,3361,78,dora game rg orl tw self harm suicide attempt let start like hello name dora nickname starting 7th grade started struggle depression exactly sure came happened fast suddenly went sweet girl cared everyone self conscious beating getting 100 blaming thing even control triggered severe anxiety something 13 year old never deal started self harm 7th grade well guess wa kind trend weird sound mind wa nothing serious everyone else wa bad right wrong many scar destroyed body image live forever let skip forward 8th grade depression kind went away anxiety wa still high got year easy drama made ton new friend wa fun everything hit like train wa suspended lost every last friend entire grade hated everything fell apart rapidly depression came back time wa even worse anxiety skyrocketed went able bottle emotion emotional wreck cry simplest thing well mean else wa supposed wa hated everyone started self harm hardcore started planning suicide day would wa always perfecting make sure nothing go wrong survive miserable decided wait summer nobody would pretend care one hurting wa met going call mateo privacy known mateo since 5th grade friend school let friendship sky rocketed wa friend fell love told tried pushing away back tried best ignore always caught eye wa helping know yet figured push little worry hurt suicide skip forward june maybe july wa still hated everyone loved mateo hold onto family went bed grabbed right pill amount knife picked knife slit wrist wa able pill mateo called something night told answer besides suppose owed final goodbye phone call go way expected picked wa really happy went talking stuff asking wa bringing fun school couple month ago tell wa threw pill away cleaned bloody wrist layed bed talked next 6 hour following month got lot better fact first time three year want live excited future future right still love actually like taking thing slowly oh btw tell night couple month later wa upset fact could lost almost killed summer one phone call changed everything
I am having a depressive feeling..,"I (18M) have been having a depressive feeling since 3 years. Actually it has worsened during this year. I no longer have the will to do anything which I have interest in such as playing guitar. I stopped listening to music (not kidding). I literally feel that I have hit my lowest at times. I don't feel confident anymore. I also don't feel like attending college lectures as well. In other words, I have lost interest almost everything. I have become very hopeless.

Plus I also don't have a girlfriend and I am a failure in love life as I have been rejected many times. Any girl who I start liking is already taken.

I also don't get proper sleep at night these days.

In simpler words, I don't feel like fighting anymore. I am very weary. Plus I cannot visit a therapist as I don't have money nor do I want to alert my parents

Trying to help my brother,"My brother has had anxiety and depression for the last 10 years. I also believe he has avoidant personality disorder. I would like to know how best to connect with him.

I don’t want to overwhelm my brother with messages. My parents do this and I believe it’s a reason for his avoidant personality. 

Recently he has lost his job and been going through an unusually rough patch. He’s posting “cries for help” on social media so I reached out to him. I asked if he needs anything and mentioned that I used to have similar problems and have a few suggestions that worked for me if he wants me to share them. He did not respond. Later I messaged him with a possible job connection I had but he is still not responding to my texts.

Can anyone with relevant experience give me advice on what the best course of action would be for me to take? We have never talked about his depression together because he is very closed off and I felt like I did not understand his problem.

why am i not enough? why am i never emough?,"i posted this on r/lonely but i guess it fits here too

i feel like everyone hates me, and even if i try my best to be liked, they still do

i just want someone to like me, someone that looks at me and feels happy, and someone to look so i can feel happy too

im just...im not enough, no matter how much i try and try...i dont know what to do, i never know

im not perfect like everyone else, not as smart or as charming or as talented as everyone else either, i...i dont know what to do

i dont wanna be alone anymore...everyone has someone, or at least, everyone had someone at some point...i couldnt even do that

i couldnt even keep someone for a week...im pathetic

but i still remember that feeling, like a light inside my chest, making me feel like i could do anything i wanted and be the best at it...it made me feel like i could take on the world and more

i felt, like i found something i've been looking for for years

i felt like my life was finally going in the direction i wanted it, like it was finally right and...i had something to look for in the future

and of course i ruined everything, because i always ruin everything...then everyone started going away...and now im alone again

i had everything i wanted and i lost it all again

i just wanted someone so i wouldnt be alone anymore...someone to make happy, someone to plan a future with and to have fun and do many amazing things together...and i tried my best...and it still wasnt enough

I don't know what I'm doing or why,"I don't know where to start with this, but today I broke up with my girlfriend and I didn't feel anything.

She was crying to me on the phone for hours, all I could think of was eating dinner.

Last month was officially one year since I graduated from university. I barely remember being there.

I don't have a job, I have no motivation, I have nothing and nobody, I feel nothing.

I have a lot of unhealed scars from my childhood, I was physically and mentally abused by my stepdad. Neglected and rejected by my real mother before being placed for adoption. My adoptive mother died, my foster brother took his own life and left a note blaming me because he thought his mum loved me more than him.

My new dad didn't want anything to do with me and said I was cursed, to him, I killed his wife and son. I ran away and was homeless for most of my 20's. I've never had real friends, I've never let anyone close to me. Are these excuses? Probably. These things were so long ago that I barely remember anymore.

I push anybody that tries to get close to me away. I don't want anything, I just want to be left alone, or do I? I spend all day playing video games because when I don't, I have to face reality and it hurts.

I'm 32 now. It's pathetic. I live in a small home on my own, it's very cheap but very quiet and lonely.

I can't snap out of this spiral of misery on misery. I don't know what I'm doing or why, so I do nothing. Then I feel guilt or shame, the thought of seeing anybody I used to know and it gets worse.

The world is just grey to me, I see people smile and laugh, I laugh back but I have no idea what they're saying or laughing at. I don't care, I just want to feel the way they do.

I remember I went to therapy once and he asked me how I feel, I've never felt much of anything.

The sun goes up, the sun goes down and I'm just watching the world go by.

I avoid talking to anybody or being known by anybody. I don't feel angry. I just feel nothing.

From time to time, I go slightly below or above 0, feeling a little something bad or good.

I want to be happy but where do I even start? I am useless, my experience and education are a joke.

For the first time a few weeks ago I thought about ending it all, that's never happened before and not happened since, I would never do that. Am I writing this for attention, that's what they say? I don't think so. I want advice, what am I doing and why? What's wrong with me? Why am I so pathetic? I hate who I am. Why am I writing this? Am I depressed? I don't think so.

Should I Leave My Job with Good Terms Because of Anxiety and Stress?,"Hello. I'm in my early twenties and I am a beginner programmer. About a month ago I received a job offer to join a new startup company as a junior programmer.

They said that I'll start there as a temp for a probationary period and based on my work they'll decide if I'll be signing for a permanent position with them. The job is a remote job, and the offered payment is okay. The managers are nice and thoughtful. Overall it's a job with good terms.

But, the issue here is not on the company side, it is me. I am diagnosed with Schizophrenia and Social Anxiety Disorder. That affects my work in multiple levels.

For example, I am getting stressful in meetings and I often try to avoid them in the first place. When I do attend meetings, I don't talk. Or, when I get tasked to do something, and there's a very tight deadline, I start to get panicked and stressed about not being able to make it.

So I'm thinking about leaving this job. When I talked to my family about this, they said that because of the good terms, I should keep it, suck it up and adapt. They say that it is a good starting point for my career. And I agree with them, and I know that if I leave this job, I probably won't be able to find something with as good terms as this. And that I won't be able to save money for later in my life. But on the other hand, as I said, I don't feel good with myself. I get stressed and anxious.

I do love the line of job that I chose, when I work on my own projects in my own terms, I am more calm and relaxed.

So this is where I am stuck now. On one hand, I'm scared of staying, because this condition might get worse, and it may be too late to leave, and it may come to a point where I'm sick of this job I won't want to do anything related to it anymore, but on the other hand, I don't know if there's anything better for me right now.

I'd appreciate some advice on this please.

"I'm think I'm depressed, but I don't have insurance to get diagnosed.","Throw away account because I'm not really comfortable sharing this on my main, I've only really spoken openly about this to my mom. Basically I can tell that my mental health has plummeted during the past two years, and I think it might be depression. I'm not entirely sure though and I'm a college student who comes from a unstable financial background, meaning I have no money for insurance. I relied on medicaid until I was too old, and haven't been able to get stable insurance yet. It really sucks because I think I might have it, but I also don't want to self diagnose because I know it might be harmful in the long run. I figured it wouldn't hurt posting about my symptoms here, just in case someone might be able to help me out. I know it's not wise to turn to the internet for help with your mental health, but I don't really know what else to do. I'm really bad at explaining my feelings, but here are a few reasons why I think I might be depressed:

1.) I'm extremely unmotivated. Not only in a lazy way (like not wanting to clean or exercise), but also emotionally. I don't have fun doing anything I used to enjoy. For example; I love video games, they have always been helpful in cheering me up. Here lately I just don't even feel like reaching for the controller anymore, which is weird because I know that I miss the feeling of playing them. The same goes for other forms of entertainment. I can think of very few anime, TV shows, or Youtube videos I've actually enjoyed watching in the past few months.

2.) This one is still on the topic of being unmotivated, but in a different sense. I don't want to leave my room for anything. I simply haven't had the energy to go anywhere, or to converse with my family. I am an introvert, so at first I thought I was just a bit socially drained, but it has been months of this.

3.) This parts a little gross, but honestly my personal hygiene has really gone down hill. I used to be a fairly well taken care of person, but lately I have not been feeling like taking care of myself. Won't go into detail, but it's honestly really embarrassing. Same goes for keeping my room clean.

4.) I often feel random waves of sadness wash over me. It happens a lot, and sometimes in inconvenient times where I just have to swallow it until I get home. Honestly crying really helps with this part, it's good stress relief.

5.) I have negative thoughts about myself a lot, and I'm scared that everyone secretly hates me. I've also had thoughts about being better off dead, however I don't think about committing suicide or self harming. These thoughts are more like ""my family would be better off if _____"".

6.) I get full nights of sleep and somehow still manage to feel tired. I also find myself dazing off quite often, and unable to concentrate. 

Now I'm not saying I haven't been happy in the past two years, but more like I'm sad way too much. I wouldn't say my symptoms are severe- I definitely know my mental health could be worse, but I still dont like feeling this way.

I'm not asking y'all to diagnose me in the replies, but please if you have any ideas of what could be wrong with me or things that can help I'd really appreciate it.

Friend dumped me after I told her I'm suicidal,"I've been struggling a lot this year (so has everyone I know). My favorite cat passed suddenly at the very beginning of the year and it hasn't been that great since. I had a super rough patch a couple months ago and admitted to her I felt like killing myself sometimes because I needed someone to vent to and today out of the blue she texted me and said we don't vibe so she blocked me on everything. We've been friends for almost 8 years with a small patch of us not talking because of some differences. I havent been friends with anyone that long so this one kinda hurt. Oh well back to no friends because I'd rather be alone than be hurt like that again.

I wish dying wasn’t so scary.,"Honestly, I’m so over life. I wish I could fall asleep forever and never wake up. I hate myself, and I hate almost everyone around me. Death scares me shitless, so I’m not at risk for suicide. I definitely feel a lot of suicidal ideation though. I have friends but no matter how hard I try, I don’t feel close to anyone. I love my boyfriend with all my heart, but I can’t help but feel like he would be better off without me. I told him this once before, and he argued with me about how his life would be ruined if I died.... I tell myself that people would get over it, even though I know for a fact that they wouldn’t. Life sucks and I think I have had these feelings for a long time. I see a therapist once a month and while it helps, it’s not a cure. I don’t want meds because side effects suck and I don’t like meds in general. I’m so sick of depression, but I also feel like I’m not worth getting better. I distract myself with video games, tv, and books. I work two jobs and I’m applying for college... but looking back I have always hid myself from these feelings. I distract myself from them.

Good energy hours,"Few times a year, at completely random times, I get these what I call good/happy energy hours. When I feel I could do everything - conquer the whole world even -  and there is nothing to stop me. Seriously, at such times there is almost nothing that would stop it and make it go away, but unfortunately after a while it goes away by itself and my mood switches back to - what I already consider normal after all those years - mix of neutral and depressed state, nihilistic even.


I was trying to figure out what triggered these ""good hours"", from going back to what I did, ate (I'm tracking my food), how much hours I slept, what happened and so on, to replicate it somehow, but I was not able to trigger or force it anyhow. It just comes itself from time to time and goes away after few hours (I guess due tiredness eventually).
I thought it has a lot to do with diet and being rested after good nights sleep, but nope. No matter what I ate or how much I slept that day or before, it always came out of the blue, which is really strange, interesting and rather frustrating at the same time.


I wish I could trigger this every day for at least few hours (preferably outside of work, hah), because I'm tired of feeling tired and depressed most of the time. I get that everybody feels tired from time to time and have those ""lazy days"", feeling like not doing anything, and that nobody is happy 24/7 - even though some celebrities are portayed that way and some people seem like they are. It's just that for me this is how I feel most of the time and those days or hours of not feeling tired and nihilistic about everything are almost non existent. They come and go randomly and for short amount of time. Almost like my brain is playing a rock'n'roll concert for itself few times a year.


Brain chemicals (and brains in general) are really weird and complicated. I wish we could already understand more about them and somehow make people more happy overall, but we still know so little.. :-(

I'm not sure if this is even allowed or the right place to ask this dumb question of mine..,"I don't know if I actually have depression but I've always felt this really big wave of sadness that always turns South after 2 minutes it happens as well as having that swelling throat sensation. My chest always gets 10x's heavier (I also have asthma but I don't mean my asthma acts up like this) and whenever I try talking to myself (sometimes I have to put myself down and call myself the same insults and names my mother calls me to stop ugly crying). I know me deliberately insulting myself is bad but I can't help it honestly. What my mother says to me doesn't make me cry because that is someone I hate passionately. I feel empty and more often than not, I feel like I'm not worth anything. A lot of times, I always find myself thinking and asking myself ""What would happen if I just disappeared?"" With how my family is, I'm sure they wouldn't miss me. If anything, they'd more than likely be so glad and perhaps even happy that I'm no longer around them. Believe it or not but my family hates me more than they hate politics and I won't ever know why. I always do everything they want, give then what they want, say what they want to hear and the likes but yet, they hate me. My mother made it clear that being admitted into a crisis center is the same as being admitted into an asylum which I'd like to believe very wrong. I'm 99% sure that they are 2 completely different things but the reason I was admitted into one of the centers was because of my past failed attempts. 

I have yet to talk to a doctor but I dont want to because I cant drive yet and if my parents find out about my reason for going to the doctor, they'll be pissed off even more. 

I haven't googled what having depression means but some of my college friends have it and they suspect me of having it too.

"I hear it's never too late to get help, but that depends on the condition of the world.","I can't remember being stable or feeling unprovoked happiness, but for most of my childhood I had hobbies and passions to keep me occupied, until senior year of high school. I remember a swift change happening in my personality over the course of just a couple weeks. I kinda lost all my fight and barely graduated.

I spent a couple years at a community college a few miles down the road, working on a music degree and generally just doing the bare minimum to survive. It was shortly before I dropped out in 2018 that I finally told my doctor something felt wrong psychologically.

2 years, 4 therapists, and countless med switches later, I've found that depression is the least of my worries. I spent the longest time thinking it was normal to need some time to cry every day. After all of this treatment my breakdowns are no less common and I've pushed several friends and loved ones to their limits... and honestly, I'm surprised that I'm still here after a quarter-century of either struggling to live every day, or wishing I didn't have to.

In 2020 I've faced the horror of the only employer I've stayed with for any long term teetering on the brink of collapse since they can't operate during the pandemic. I've come to terms with the prospect of there not even being peace where I live by the time business as usual can resume. It's been since New Year's Day that I've even had a fuckin hug, man. I've resisted the urge to cope in any dangerous or unlawful ways, but I feel just as far gone as the people in my community that have OD'd in the last few years. I try to take some of the edge off with some hard cider, but I can't bring myself to get drunk enough to feel happy; alcohol took someone important from me and I don't want to go out that way.

Truth be told, I don't know what convinced me to type this all out. I suppose it's a damn pity party, at least in part. I suppose what I'm trying to say with all of this is... sometimes, it really is too late for someone to save themselves, and some tunnels don't come out the other side. But even if I'm miserable every single day for another 40 or 50 years, I'm gonna face it, because part of my horrible mental health comes from the trauma of losing someone because they drowned in their struggles. I don't want to fuck up anybody else that way.",a2lsbCBtZQ,1,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jxnhrl/i_hear_its_never_too_late_to_get_help_but_that/,remember stable feeling unprovoked happiness childhood hobby passion keep occupied senior year high school remember swift change happening personality course couple week kinda lost fight barely graduated spent couple year community college mile road working music degree generally bare minimum survive wa shortly dropped 2018 finally told doctor something felt wrong psychologically 2 year 4 therapist countless med switch later found depression least worry spent longest time thinking wa normal need time cry every day treatment breakdown le common pushed several friend loved one limit honestly surprised still quarter century either struggling live every day wishing 2020 faced horror employer stayed long term teetering brink collapse since operate pandemic come term prospect even peace live time business usual resume since new year day even fuckin hug man resisted urge cope dangerous unlawful way feel far gone people community od last year try take edge hard cider bring get drunk enough feel happy alcohol took someone important want go way truth told know convinced type suppose damn pity party least part suppose trying say sometimes really late someone save tunnel come side even miserable every single day another 40 50 year gonna face part horrible mental health come trauma losing someone drowned struggle want fuck anybody else way,hear never late get help depends condition world,2 l bc b tz q,2310,87,2 l bc b tz q remember stable feeling unprovoked happiness childhood hobby passion keep occupied senior year high school remember swift change happening personality course couple week kinda lost fight barely graduated spent couple year community college mile road working music degree generally bare minimum survive wa shortly dropped 2018 finally told doctor something felt wrong psychologically 2 year 4 therapist countless med switch later found depression least worry spent longest time thinking wa normal need time cry every day treatment breakdown le common pushed several friend loved one limit honestly surprised still quarter century either struggling live every day wishing 2020 faced horror employer stayed long term teetering brink collapse since operate pandemic come term prospect even peace live time business usual resume since new year day even fuckin hug man resisted urge cope dangerous unlawful way feel far gone people community od last year try take edge hard cider bring get drunk enough feel happy alcohol took someone important want go way truth told know convinced type suppose damn pity party least part suppose trying say sometimes really late someone save tunnel come side even miserable every single day another 40 50 year gonna face part horrible mental health come trauma losing someone drowned struggle want fuck anybody else way hear never late get help depends condition world

Every day that im alive is living hell aside from the 45 minute buzzes I get.  I’ve quit so many times just to come back. I also mix with other prescription drugs. I genuinely think I’m going to die soon. I’ve been to the hospital 3 times this year.

Biggest discovery that has made me happier.,"Other people's attitude isn't always my fault.

For a long time if someone gave me attitude or was upset I always blamed my self. Someone would say something with an annoyed or mad tone I would take it personally. I would blame my self, it was my fault that they were mad. Same thing when someone was upset or feeling down. I felt I was letting them down and that I was failing them.

Except it's not my fault. I don't control others, I can only control my self. If they want to be mad about something out of my control then so be them. But I don't need to put my self down because of how they feel.

Another thing I realized is it's okay to be angry at people. I would not allow my self to feel anger at others. I felt that I was responsible for their feelings and so being angry at them for something that was my fault was unjust. But now I realize that I'm not in control of them, and if someone is going to take their anger out on me unjustly then I'm allowed to feel anger back at them.

Now I would like to add that this doesn't give myself or anyone a license to be a dick. If you actively or even passively due to your own negligence, wrong someone then you are at fault for their anger or sadness. And being angry at someone for their emotions caused by you wronging them, then you are a dick.

The biggest thing is to take a step back and look at the situation as a whole. Is it really your fault they feel that way.

NOW MY MOM KNOWS I'M SUICIDAL AND DEPRESSED AND I REGRET TELLING HER...,My mom was suspicious of me and thought something was going on with me coz she saw scars on my arm. Last night I got a little too drunk at a family gathering and ended up telling my mom that I attempted suicide various times and I have self harmed. Now I can't even look at her face without feeling guilty. I don't want her to worry about me. I feel very guilty and I just wish I shouldn't have told her about this. I feared what would she think if she realises that her son no longer wishes to live. And like all my other fears this also came true.

This shit hurts,"There is something soul crushing about needing someone to be there for you. And the one person you want to be there for you, isn’t

It makes the already hardness of struggling worst knowing they aren’t around because of your mental health

It messes with my mind. I just want someone to love me for me.

I didn’t ask for ptsd. I didn’t ask for depression. I didn’t ask for anxiety

All I’ve ever wanted to love and support but I’ve found when I’m acting “happy” and look “successful” everyone is interested 

But when I actually face my demons, when I’m real. I’m too much for people, I’m alone

It just furthers the narrative.

It’s amazing if someone would just see me for me, validate my experiences, tell me they are sorry people hurt me and didn’t apologize and just were a basic nice loving person how much it would help. Doesn’t need to be crazy love

Just consistent, non toxic

Fell peacefully into a world of nothing.,"It’s my first time posting here. I just turned 25, and have dealt with depression all my life. Other than my boyfriend, I have no support system &amp; my family hates me. They take all of their frustrations out on me and blame me for the way their lives have turned out. Today was a particularly bad day. I was very upset and just isolated myself. I changed clothes &amp; got into bed. I drifted off to sleep and for the first time in ages, it was amazing. I escaped. I couldn’t hear the constant criticism. The endless thoughts of me wanting to die. The disgusted looks of family members. I slept so peacefully. Why can’t it be that way forever? Why do I have to live in such a hateful environment, surrounded by people who think I’m a piece of shit anyway? I look forward to death way more than I do another day in this hellhole called life.

Therapy,Hello everyone! I’m a M17 and have been struggling for a while now due to self hate and events in my life haven’t helped with my mental health either. It got so bad to were I planned to kill myself under a secluded bridge so no one could find my body. Fortunately I never went through with the plan because I talked about with my therapist. I am so fortunate that my parents recognized that I needed someone to talk to. It does work and helped me a lot during the times were I had my worst days. I recommend if you feel like you need to be in therapy you 100% should go. I know that a lot of people say they don’t need it or say it won’t work and that it won’t help them. Going to therapy is the best decision I’ve ever done in my life because I feel if I never went there I would probably be dead right now.

My shoulders aren’t broad enough,"Just started a new job and I hate it. I’ve been at home with my toddler through covid and this job fell from the sky this week, I didn’t want to seem ungrateful so I took it. I know the money will help us so my SO isn’t stretched so thin. I haven’t been myself for months though even before this job opportunity.

My libido is non existent and I can feel that affecting my relationship, just can’t muster up the energy to be sexual.

I know I shouldn’t  fantasize about suicide because I have a family but it just feels so relieving to imagine. I won’t act on it of course.

I feel so useless. I don’t know how working mother cope I’m drowning.

The work has eaten away my patience too so I get irritable over her normal toddler things. I feel like a shit mom.

I keep thinking of reasons to not meet up with my friend for yoga in the evening even though it’s just 30 mins over video chat.

I honestly don’t know how people cope. No one can give me advice because there is never a right answer.

My partner is upset with me because we keep bickering.

I want to run away. Again, I won’t act on these impulses but I just really don’t know how to keep facing life.

I want to not be so useless and miserable.

Help healing from absent/abusive father+thoughts on coping mechanism.,"As the title says, my dad was pretty absent and became downright abusive once I was 15/16 (I’m a 20 year old male). Around the time he became abusive, I started to become close to an older male high school teacher who I wished could be my dad. We were cool throughout high school but unfortunately don’t talk anymore. 

Once I graduated high school I became close with a family friend (late 40s guy) who seriously took on the role of a father in my life. He’s genuinely one of the most inspiring incredible people I’ve ever met and we’re really really close. I’m not sure what typical father son relationships are like because I didn’t have one with my bio dad, but my family friend and I say I love you to each other and hug each other all the time, so I think we’re closer than most fathers and sons (at least with sons my age). 

I’ve realized that the way I cope with my shitty relationship with my bio dad is by becoming exceptionally close to other older men in my life and hoping they become a father figure. I don’t think there is anything inherently destructive about that coping mechanism in itself, but I have a tendency to get really attached (probably overly so) to these “father figures” to my own detriment.  

Lately with my family friend I’ve been feeling like I’m excessively emotionally invested in the relationship and really needy as a result. Even though my relationship with this family friend is probably the best part of my life, I feel this profound sadness about it too because I don’t get to spend as much time with him because he works more. If I could, I’d spend every single day with him, but I only get to see him a few times a month now. I wish I could be okay with that but it really weighs down on me, especially because this is the last year we’ll be living in the same city. I want to maintain this relationship and be close to him but also feel okay when we’re apart. Any advice regarding the situation with my family friend and this coping mechanism more generally would be greatly appreciated!

Why am I taking meds?,"Dual posting but the topic is completely different so...

I went through four or five different treatments already, every time the doctor determined it was not right for me. I'm tired of trying to look for a proper one.

"My life is worth nothing, I wish I was aborted","I’m a 22, nearly 23 year old male. I’m a physically healthy and well-educated man. I live under a great roof, I have food, clothes and entertainment but there truly is a huge void in my life and I want to end it. I am suicidal but I do not want to end my life. I wouldn’t have a problem ending it if I had to. I’m okay with dying. 

I live with my mother and two grandparents. My grandmother is the only person in this world who is nice to me and I really don’t know why. My mother despises me, we have spent 10 weeks of the last 3 months not talking. My father took his own life when I was 8, apparently he was an emotionally abusive bully. Last week, my mother told me that I’m a bully just like my father. I don’t know what I have done. I just want to be cared for, I want to feel safe, loved and protected. I just want my only parent to be nice to me. I have no siblings. My grandfather doesn’t like me either, he hasn’t spoken to me in weeks. I don’t know what I’ve done wrong because the rest of my family is completely normal with me. 

Since I can remember, I’ve been severely depressed. I have anxiety and I’m sure I’m bipolar to some extent. I’ve never actually gotten any help for this because I don’t have the motivation and I can’t do it on my own. I’ve tried to hint that I’m not feeling well to some family members hoping for some support or push but nothing, just get told to go out and exercise. I’ve been told by multiple family members that I seem like someone who is really depressed. I fantasise constantly about killing myself and the urge is great, I’ve made several attempts and plans to before but I just can’t do it to my family. I self harm instead, just for now. I constantly obsess about hoping to get a severe illness that would kill me or being seriously injured in an accident. I’m not sure why. I guess I just want something else to kill me rather than it be me who takes my own life. 

I dread waking up in the morning, I waste my day sitting down in front of the tv. There’s not much more I can do right now. I barely get out of the house, I don’t see anyone and I don’t get any healthy socialising. My country is in another lockdown right now. I’ve worked many good jobs. I’m in my third out of four years of studies in University because I’ve been held back two years. I’m taking whatever qualifications I can from this year and that will be it. I can’t waste any more time. I’ve been held back in so many ways due to my mental issues and I can’t explain it. I don’t want to be like this. I feel like a failure in every way imaginable. 

I operate on routine - it is the most important thing in my life because it keeps me going. That has been completely taken from me and I haven’t been able to have any since the start of this year. I can’t deal with the thoughts of going into another year of this bullshit. I never feel good. I’m never happy, my mind is always full of bad thoughts and feelings. I feel like I’ll never escape this. I had high hopes of leaving the country next year to start fresh somewhere else but it seems like that’s not going to happen now with the world we live in today. 

I’ve been considering getting a flight to another country to become homeless and stay there. This way I can run from this hell, responsibilities and hopefully cut my life short by a significant amount of years. I have no sense of direction. I’ve always wanted to be a pilot but that’s another thing that’s been taken - I don’t have that much money to train to be a pilot and in today’s world, pilots are not in demand like they used to be. 

5 years ago, I had thought that by now I would be on my feet and living life. But here I am. A dead man walking. I have been sucked of everything I have inside of me. I hate this world. 

Please, someone help me. I’m really stuck, this is a genuine cry for help. I don’t know how long more I can handle this. This life is too much for me.

How others see me dictates my worth," M 17. I base my self-worth on how others see me. If I say something to a crowd that can be seen as offensive without realizing it, for example, or flirt with a girl that I THOUGHT was flirting with me but wasn't, I will absolutely break, the thought won't leave my head for weeks, and there's a big chance I might panic for days, unable to live with my disgusting self. I have generalized anxiety disorder, and even though I hardly feel anxious on the day to day basis, in this situations my anxiety takes over me.

This is very hard to admit, but I am a very clueless person who doesn't know when it's appropriate to do something or not. Even then, instead of simply learn with my mistakes, I completely base my self-worth on the negative reaction I receive the few times something like this happens.

"Help on ""wasting time in bed"" and feeling pessimistic","I know you guys are bored reading similar rants and questions from me.

Preface:

I have chronic fatigue due to chronic stress. I often have  random small wounds on my hands probably due to hypo symptoms (my doc doesn't want to do anything more) It's been 1 month  since starting HRT (MtF) but still nothing obviously.

My depression is intertwined with dysphoria and the only way it comes out is random bursts of rage and tearing up but not crying.

One of my main issues as I see it is ""wasting"" too much time lying in bed during the weekends. I usually do it when I feel crushing sadness and dysphoria. 

I have so much work to do on the PC PhD wise but I'm so exhausted I just want to get under the blankets. I do work alot during the weekdays though.

When I lie down I sometimes think about various things but usually end up sleeping. That doesn't stop me from sleeping during the night.

I ""feel"" I should be working (although technically it's my free time). I can't exercise because I crash (adrenal crash?) . I will feel way worse if I do. Even a brisk hike is often too much.

I try to go for a walk every day but that's about it.  I don't even game because I hate it now. 

Doing something for my dysphoria (wearing women's clothes or painting my nails doesn't do anything). It's like ""yeah so what"".

I am taking a antidepressant and going to a therapist. So far it's too early for the drug to work.

My main question is: should I feel so bad ""wasting"" my time and sleeping? (I actually feel tired).

Another is how to think in a positive way. 

My therapist tells me I need to stop the ""what ifs"" and ""I wish I had tried that"" and give myself credit for what I've done (started laser, HRT...).

I try to do that but when my mind goes to how much my health sucks now. 

Plus that it keeps getting worse.

It's like I can feel I'm slowly dying. I mean we all are but that's not what I mean.

 Then I'm like ""what's the point? I just want to rest. I don't care anymore"".

How to improve in these two aspects?

 Ideally I would lie down until my HRT starts to work and I start to feel a little bit physically better. 

That's not going to happen though obviously.",kelly_1979,0,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/jywy47/help_on_wasting_time_in_bed_and_feeling/,know guy bored reading similar rant question preface chronic fatigue due chronic stress often random small wound hand probably due hypo symptom doc want anything 1 month since starting hrt mtf still nothing obviously depression intertwined dysphoria way come random burst rage tearing cry one main issue see wasting much time lying bed weekend usually feel crushing sadness dysphoria much work pc phd wise exhausted want get blanket work alot weekday though lie sometimes think various thing usually end sleeping stop sleeping night feel working although technically free time exercise crash adrenal crash feel way worse even brisk hike often much try go walk every day even game hate something dysphoria wearing woman clothes painting nail anything like yeah taking antidepressant going therapist far early drug work main question feel bad wasting time sleeping actually feel tired another think positive way therapist tell need stop ifs wish tried give credit done started laser hrt try mind go much health suck plus keep getting worse like feel slowly dying mean mean like point want rest care anymore improve two aspect ideally would lie hrt start work start feel little bit physically better going happen though obviously,help wasting time bed feeling pessimistic,kelly 1979,2172,53,kelly 1979 know guy bored reading similar rant question preface chronic fatigue due chronic stress often random small wound hand probably due hypo symptom doc want anything 1 month since starting hrt mtf still nothing obviously depression intertwined dysphoria way come random burst rage tearing cry one main issue see wasting much time lying bed weekend usually feel crushing sadness dysphoria much work pc phd wise exhausted want get blanket work alot weekday though lie sometimes think various thing usually end sleeping stop sleeping night feel working although technically free time exercise crash adrenal crash feel way worse even brisk hike often much try go walk every day even game hate something dysphoria wearing woman clothes painting nail anything like yeah taking antidepressant going therapist far early drug work main question feel bad wasting time sleeping actually feel tired another think positive way therapist tell need stop ifs wish tried give credit done started laser hrt try mind go much health suck plus keep getting worse like feel slowly dying mean mean like point want rest care anymore improve two aspect ideally would lie hrt start work start feel little bit physically better going happen though obviously help wasting time bed feeling pessimistic
"New wiki on how to avoid accidentally encouraging suicide, and how to spot covert incitement","We've been seeing a worrying increase in pro-suicide content showing up here and, and also going unreported. This undermines our purpose here, so we wanted to highlight and clarify our guidelines about both direct and indirect incitement of suicide.  

We've created a wiki that covers these issues.  We hope this will be helpful to anyone who's wondering whether something's okay here and which responses to report.  It explains in detail why *any* validation of suicidal intent, even an ""innocent"" message like ""if you're 100% committed, I'll just wish you peace"" is likely to increase people's pain, and why it's important to report even subtle pro-suicide comments. The full text of the wiki's current version is below, and it is maintained at [/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement). 

We deeply appreciate everyone who gives responsive, empathetic, non-judgemental support to our OPs, and we particularly thank everyone who's already been reporting incitement in all forms.  

Please report any post or comment that encourages suicide (or that breaks any of the other guidelines in the sidebar) to the moderators, either by clicking the ""report"" button or by [sending us a modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2FSuicideWatch) with a link. We deal with all guideline violations that are reported to us as soon as we can, but we can't read everything so community reports are essential. If you get a PM that breaks the guidelines, please report it both [to the reddit sitewide admins](http://www.reddit.com/report) and to us in modmail. 

Thanks to all the great citizens of the community who help flag problem content and behaviour for us.

***[/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement](http://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/wiki/incitement)***  
*******

###Summary###

**It's important to respect and understand people's experiences and emotions. It's never necessary, helpful, or kind to support suicidal intent. There are some common misconceptions (discussed below) about suicidal people and how to help them that can cause well-meaning people to inadvertently incite suicide. There are also people online who incite suicide on purpose, often while pretending to be sympathetic and helpful.** 

###Validate Feelings and Experiences, Not Self-Destructive Intentions###

We're here to offer support, not judgement.  That means accepting, with the best understanding we can offer, whatever emotions people express.  Suicidal people are suffering, and we're here to try to ease that by providing support and caring.  The most reliable way we know to de-escalate someone at risk is to give them the experience of feeling understood. That means not judging whether they should be feeling the way they are, or telling them what to do or not do.  

But there's an important line to draw here.  There's a crucial difference between empathizing with feelings and responding non-judgmentally to suicidal thoughts, and in any way endorsing, encouraging, or validating suicidal intentions or hopeless beliefs. **It's both possible and important to convey understanding and compassion for someone's suicidal thoughts without putting your finger on the scale of their decision.**

Anything that condones suicide, even passively, *encourages* suicide. It isn't supportive and does not help. It also violates reddit's sitewide rules as well as our guidelines. Explicitly inciting suicide online is a criminal offense in most jurisdictions. 

Do not treat any OP's post as meaning that will definitely die by suicide and can't change their minds or be helped. Anyone who's able to read the comments here still has a chance to choose whether or not to try to keep living, even if they've also been experiencing intense thoughts of suicide, made a suicide plan, or started carrying it out.  

In [the most useful empirical model we have](https://www.apa.org/science/about/psa/2009/06/sci-brief), the desire to die by suicide primarily comes from two interpersonal factors; alienation and a sense of being a burden or having nothing to offer. These factors usually lead to a profound feeling of being unwelcome in the world. 

**So, any acceptance or reinforcement of suicidal intent, even something ""innocent"" like ""I hope you find peace"", is actually a form of covert shunning that validates a person's sense that they're unwelcome in the world. It will usually add to their pain even if kindly meant and gently worded.**  

###How to Avoid Validating Suicidal Intent###

Keep the following in mind when offering support to anyone at risk for suicide.  

* **People who say they don't want help usually can feel better if they get support that doesn't invalidate their emotions.** Unfortunately, [many popular ""good"" responses are actually counterproductive](https://www.speakingofsuicide.com/2015/03/03/what-not-to-say/). In particular, many friends and family tend to rely exclusively on trying to convince the suicidal person that ""it's not so bad"", and this is usually experienced as ""I don't understand what you're going through and I'm not going to try"".  People who've had ""help"" that made them feel worse don't want any more of the same.  It doesn't mean that someone who actually knows how to be supportive can't give them any comfort.   

*  **Most people who are suicidal want to end their** ***pain,*** **not their lives.**  It's almost never true that death is the only way to end these people's suffering. Of course there are exceptional situations, and we certainly acknowledge that, for some people, the right help can be difficult to find. But preventing someone's suicide doesn't mean prolonging their suffering if we do it by giving them real comfort and understanding. 

* ***An unfixable problem doesn't mean that a good life will never be possible***.  We don't have to fix or change anything to help someone feel better. It's important to keep in mind that the correlation between our outer circumstances and our inner experience is weaker and less direct than commonly assumed.  For every kind of difficult life situation, you will find some people who lapse into suicidal despair, and others who cope amazingly well, and a whole spectrum in between. A key difference is how much inner resilience the person has at the time. This can depend on many personal and situational factors. But when there's not enough, interpersonal support can both compensate for its absence and help rebuild it.  We go into more depth on the ""it gets better"" issue in [this PSA Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/25igd7/whats_wrong_with_it_gets_better_what_if_it_doesnt/) which is always linked from our sidebar (community info on mobile) guidelines. 

* **There are** ***always*** **more choices than brutally forcing someone to stay alive or passively letting them end their lives**.

To avoid accidentally breaking the anti-incitement rule, don't say or try to imply that acting on suicidal thoughts is a good idea, or that someone can't turn back or is already dead.  Do whatever you can to help them feel cared for and welcome, at least in this little corner of the world.  [Our talking tips](http://redd.it/igh87) offer more detailed guidance.

###Look Out for Deliberate Incitement.  It May Come in Disguise.###

Often comments that subtly encourage suicidal intent actually come from suicide fetishists and voyeurs ([unfortunately this is a real and disturbing phenomenon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Francis_Melchert-Dinkel)). People like this *are* out there and the anonymous nature of reddit makes us particularly attractive to them.  

They will typically try to scratch their psychological ""itch"" by saying things that push people closer to the edge.  They often do this by exploiting the myths that we debunked in the bullet points above.  Specifically you might see people doing the following:

* Encouraging the false belief that the only way suicidal people can end their pain is by dying.  **There are** ***always*** **more and better choices than ""brutally forcing someone to stay alive"" or helping (actively or passively) them to end their lives**.

* Creating an artificial and toxic sense of ""solidarity"" by linking their encouragement of suicide to empathy.  They will represent themselves as the only one who really understand the suicidal person, while either directly or indirectly encouraging their self-loathing emotions and self-destructive impulses.  **Since most people in suicidal crisis are in desperate need to empathy and understanding, this is a particularly dangerous form of manipulation.**  

Many suicide inciters are adept at putting a benevolent spin on their activities while actually luring people away from sources of real help.  A couple of key points to keep in mind: 

* **Skilled suicide intervention -- peer or professional -- is based on empathic responsiveness to the person's feelings that reduces their suffering in the moment.**  Contrary to pop-culture myths, it does **not** involve persuasion (""Don't do it!""), cheerleading (""You've got this!"") or meaningless false promises (""Trust me, it gets better!""), or invalidation (""Let me show you how things aren't as bad as you think!"").  Anyone who leads others to expect these kinds of toxic responses, or any other response that prolongs their pain, from expert help may be covertly pro-suicide. (Of course, people sometimes do have bad experience when seeking mental-health treatment, and it's fine to vent about those, but processing our own disappointment and frustration is entirely different from trying to destroy someone else's hope of getting help.)

* **Choices made by competent responders are always informed by the understanding that breaching someone's trust is traumatic and must be avoided if possible.**  Any kind of involuntary intervention is an **extremely unlikely** outcome when someone consults a clinician or calls a hotline. (Confidentiality is addressed in more detail in [our Hotlines FAQ post](http://redd.it/1c7ntr)). The goal is always to provide all help with the client's full knowledge and informed consent. We know that no individual or system is perfect.  Mistakes that lead to bad experiences do sometimes happen to vulnerable people, and we have enormous sympathy for them. But anyone who suggests that this is the norm might be trying to scare people away from the help they need.

Please remember that NO ACTIVISM of any kind is allowed here. Not today or any day.,"Activism, i.e. advocating or fundraising for social change or raising awareness of social issues (and suicide *is*, inescapably, a social issue) is absolutely against the rules here at all times.  

Please understand that we're all for well-informed, strategically-savvy activism.  It's essential in the fight against stigma, misinformation, and discrimination, and the fight for research, treatment, accommodation, acceptance, and understanding.  Most of us, one way or another, are mental-health activists IRL.  

But activism just doesn't work in a dedicated support space that serves a vulnerable population.  We used to allow it, until the evidence that it was undermining our primary purpose became overwhelming, and, not without regret, we made this rule.

I'm going to kill myself on my birthday,"my fucked up logic is that they'll only have to mourn one day of the year i guess. though i know it'll crush them in so many ways. it's so fucked up. my family was talking about birthday plans today as it's coming up soon and i just replied like a fucking robot saying all the things i should say and I'm a LIAR i was lying to their fucking faces. my birthday is always the most depressing time of year. i hate that i was even born so.. so much. I've been depressed and suicidal since i was so little and i honestly have no good reason. nothing ever really happened to me i guess it's just my brain and i feel so shitty that some people here don't even have someone to mourn them. i think about the people that have no one to care about them and i feel so bad and i wish i could give up my life for them or donate my organs and blood for people who needed it just so i could feel good when i commit ""the most selfish act""... it also just lines up with a lot right now  ..it just feels right. it's been a long grueling couple of years since my last attempt and nothing has felt right since then. i am in so much pain and i just want freedom i just a release from all this physicial and mental pain. i guess... a lot of you will tell me not to do it for a lot of reasons. and I don't want to ""argue against"" you i really don't because you have good intentions. but I can't help but feel they're blind replies and you don't really know me so I don't know what to say. should i convince you i am someone who needs to die? thats sounds awful and ultimately negative. but I'm just so alone and scared and tired and posting and replying to posts here because people in the same train of thought feel familiar to me and i only feel a connection in this fucked up way to others that feel the same. but I don't want anyone to die. suicide is so ugly and i wish there was anothet way to just end it and not have all the mess and shit that follows but it's like we can't have that. its always going to be a shitstorm that sucks sooo.. so bad... but come on.. I don't know... i can't begin to explain to you why i feel it's the right decision and i dont WANT TO explain or have you believe or agree with me  .. but I'm just soo fucking alone and want someone to hear me before i go otherwise i wouldn't post this. i know I'll be completely forgotten soon anyway. just some fucking nobody

*as an additional extremely fucked up train of thought that i think i've posted here before... i'm going to be an uncle soon and ... i can't be alive... i know i'm going to kill myself some day and i don't .. i'd rather not exist in this poor kid's life than be the uncle that killed himself.. i never thought i'd live to this age that i am anyway.. every day has been some fucked up joke i've dragged myself crippled from day to day just barely.. and idk why this birth is pushing me more to do it in a way but PLEASE try and hear my logic.... i just don't .. i think my family will live for this kid. i know my mom will find new life in.. literally this new life after i go. she'll be a grandmother and i hope i'm forgotten as soon as possible. i know i'll leave scars that will never heal. but i can't stay and i can't think of a better time, god i know it's so fucked up and believe me i hate myself so much for these thoughts, i really truly do. nobody hates me more than me, i tried to KILL me! i just hate this. it's on top of everything else. i've slowly cut myself off from every friend/relationship i've ever had, i hope they've all given up. over the last two years i've slowly cut myself off more and from my family and painstakingly have been trying to make it so my absence won't be noticed as much.. as much..

** i'm not even sitting here typing this. i swear to god it's gotten so bad the unresolved untreated trauma from my last suicide attempt where i broke myself and tried to drag myself on the ground pulling grass. which is why i chose this username. i know it sounds corny or dramatic but i swear to you. i swear to fucking god i am still there on that day. i haven't MOVED A MUSCLE since that day .. i'm still there pulling grass with my leg and spine broken. i can recount every little fucking detail of the events leading up to that day and i play it in my head CONSTANTLY like a fucking background computer process. part of my brain is constantly devoted to just replaying every moment photographically from that day and i wish i wasn't devoting so much of my time and energy to this. i'm never there where people see me. at any moment i can fully place myself on the ground screaming and crying and trying to get away from my house. i wanted to run away and i was completely immobilized and i was just a fucking kid. 10 years of this shit. 10 fucking years of replaying this in my head and every detail. the sky was so bright and blue and i'm repeating myself from comments in this thread but i just want everyone to understand why i need peace and to not judge me and just know what's going on... yes even you the stranger reading this because you don't know how incredibly alone i am. and i'm just now vomiting all these thoughts here because i have nothing else. no outlet anymore. i'll never forget. i can't forget. i can feel the grass in my hands. i can feel my limp body being dragged along. i can feel and smell the grass being pulled from their roots. i hope destroying my brain will end the consciousness and erase these moments and thoughts from existence.


***i know how ridiculous i sound.. and maybe some people/mods will recognize this story because i keep saying it when people ask more and i guess i just want to feel special with my dumb sob story about my own issues because it's the only thing that makes me feel any kind of fucked up special.. and then delete my account.. it's so lame. i know... i know.. but i don't even matter and i'm so sooo insanely insignificant so why not just let me spew my word pus..?!. but just please imagine. i was. trying. to ..get awayyy.. i was trying to run away that day because i couldn't take being in that house anymore!!. i thought i would be free if even for a moment and by some sick twisted joke i was crippled at that very moment. and had to live with an untreated triple fractured leg and spine for 3 whole fucking weeks in a wheelchair.. my leg was turning green and purple and every color in between in front of m fucking eyes!! immediately after wanting to GET AWAY!! that's what broke me. that period of time waiting for surgery.. shitty surgery at that.. it's all felt like a nightmare i can't wake up from since that moment when i hit the ground and the shock wearing off. it's all felt like an untrue .. not real .. made up torture for me since then and i want the the nightmare to end.. i want to wake up.. i want to die . i want

My sister tried to kill herself two days ago.,"So. 

So. Friday night, my sister took a whole bottle, 60 pills worth, of her antidepressants. Beforehand, she had called around and apologized to a few people about things that I'm not privy to. This set off alarm bells, and somebody called emergency responders to the scene. 

When they arrived, they found her with a note, and... well, she survived. They took her to the hospital, but now she is in a behavioral health clinic. A state away. And we can't go see her. 

I am at a loss. I. Don't even know if this is the right place to come with my story. Or even what I want by telling said story. I just. 

I almost lost my sister. I was *this* close and had no idea. None. I hate this feeling. And I can't even go to her. I don't know. I don't know where to go, or what to think. 

Mainly I'm just talking I guess. Then you for reading.

I’ve found myself at peace with my death and that scares me sometimes.,"Like tonight, I’m just chilling in bed and listening to music. I’m staring at the ceiling and I feel at peace with the fact that I’m probably going to kill myself one day. I’ve never expected myself to live a long life, and I don’t particularly want to. Anytime I’ve thought about my death, it’s always been suicide. I don’t care to live a long life, but I would’ve at least liked to live a happy one. That doesn’t seem to be in the cards for me. I feel like I ended up on Earth by some kind of mistake. I feel like everyone and everything is just telling me to leave. It’d be cool if reincarnation was a thing. I’d like to have another go at this, but I think I’m just shit out of luck. I got my life and I blew it. 

I’m turning 22 in a few weeks. I don’t know why these feelings always intensify around my birthday, but they do. I don’t know how long I’m holding on for.

"I regret everything, and I want to die.","I've had suicidal thoughts for the last 11 years or so. Back in 2010, I had decided that I'd kill myself using aspirin the day after my HS graduation. Like an idiot, I kept going because I wanted to see what I could do in the world. I bought into the lie of college, got myself into a near 40k student loan debt going for my degree in computer science. On graduation, I couldn't find a job and my credit suffered. I see that as my first clue that I should have killed myself. 

But I kept going. I enlisted in the military (my grades from college were subpar, not enough for officer) so I joined the USAF. Worked in weather. Met some cool people. Got deployed. Saw straight up pieces of a guy on the ground. I took that as my 2nd clue. It was awful. But I kept going. I was stationed in Japan and I met my wife. Our son was born a year later. I worked hard and got pretty damn good at Japanese. I was even promoted to staff sergeant. Life was good. I was beginning to think life was worth living. 

We came back to the states in 2018 and things just fell apart from there. A series of lies and false accusations led to a lack of faith in me by leadership. A mistake in a forecast I did cemented that. Weeks of 12 hour shifts drove me crazy. This was my 3rd clue, but again I was persistent. I was straight up told by my commander that he wouldn't sign for my re-enlistment. I was told by both legal and everyone I talked to, to just take the honorable discharge and go.

I tried to find jobs before I was discharged. But NOTHING came up in the area. So I had to swallow my pride and return home to my folk's place with my wife and son. Mind you, my parents don't like my wife; she's Asian, and my folks aren't very big on my siblings and I being with with anyone who isn't black. Sure, they accepted us. But they're cold to me and ignore my wife, but expect to play with my son. Then fucking covid happened. There was no quality work with my skillset to be found ANYWHERE. The only place to give me a job so far is goddamn Walmart. I make less than 1k a month and my folks demand HALF my pay for living in the house I was raised in. We have nowhere else to go with Japan on lockdown and no cash for an apartment. Had no choice but to accept. They know we need to save money, especially with my wife not having her green cars yet. I'm the only one working. Do they care? Fuck no. That was my 4th clue. 

It's funny; I've worked with some of the craziest 
weather systems in the military, saw mangled corpses overseas, damn near mastered one of the more difficult languages, and here I am; back in my hometown with my wife feeling miserable around my racist family, I get paid peanuts, I put out at least 20 job applications a week yet I get no replies or answers. I cry every night because everything feels so goddamn hopeless. I cuss every time I wake up. I look at my son and get angry at myself for being a failure of a father. I can't stand those innocent eyes looking up at the piece of shit I am. 

Yet I still persist. I want to die, but in my mind I cant. My wife tells me over and over again that she loves me. I'm afraid what my son will think of his dad choosing to abandon his mother because he couldn't stand tall in dark times. I get screamed at every day at Walmart by psychos trying to steal TVs and karens looking for lysol. I've become a walking corpse that can only live for others and I feel like I'm starting to crack. 

I don't have opinions anymore. I try not to think. If I think too much I start crying. I look at the aspirin in the cabinet and it just looks more preferable every goddamn day. The house I'm in feels like I'm walking around landmines. I don't know how to make this misery stop and just one thought echoes through my mind every day;

'You fucking idiot. You should have ended it all after graduation. '

I don't know how long I'll be able to hold this up. I regret continuing beyond graduation. Nothing good came of it. I regret joining the military; I still see bodies in my dreams. I regret marrying my wife; she could have a much better life right now if not for me. I regret my son being born to a failure of a dad. I regret everything, and I want to die. I can't stand this shit and I want to fucking die.",WeissCrowley,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jyvyxm/i_regret_everything_and_i_want_to_die/,suicidal thought last 11 year back

I want to die but I’m too scared,"Came to rant since I have absolutely no one to talk to. I just want to tell someone about my situation and just my story, not sure why really. If you don’t want to read this essay then it’s fine, it’s long and boring anyway 

Today I had a really bad fight with my mother, she got offended by my tone when I was talking about my own problems, yelling at me that I’m pissing her off, I told her to chill and got a “shove that down your throat and shut the f*ck up!!” and after that the argument started. 

She was always a bit unstable, whenever I told her something was her fault she yelled “Yes yes it’s all my f*cking fault! All of you are saints, absolute saints and then there’s me, this b*tch that’s ruining all your lives, go on and stab me!!” and then there was no stopping her for hours, then when she asks for advice and I give it to her she ignores me or lectures me about how wrong I am, but when anyone besides me tells her the same thing she is like an obedient puppy, listing to every word and even tell me about how they are right, if I mention that I was the first one to say it she yells again. She claims to hate it when people even talk loudly and will ignore anyone with a loud voice but she herself yells a lot and when she is saying something important she starts muttering inaudibly and will refuse to repeat herself. 

Because of the current situation I can’t exactly leave to go study, and finding a place to rent in my country is extremely difficult as everything is really expensive (or super cheap but is in an extremely shady area where you are most likely going to get robbed) so I have to keep living with that woman. She’s been that way my entire life, when I was little I was blamed for everything because I was labelled as the “problem child”. I was diagnosed with autism when I was little but my family doesn’t believe in mental illnesses. 

I don’t have any other family besides her, dad walked out years ago. My older sister even attempted to kill me by suffocating me, her boyfriend had to step in and pull her away or else I would have ended up really injured. My brother has his own family so for him I’m just a pest, he openly complained about me being embarrassing because I’m “inadequate” because I’m not a social butterfly like him.

Along with all that there’s also the bullying I got at school. When I was little I didn’t have the same new toys as other kids so I was bullied for being boring and lame, then it changed to being bullied because I wasn’t allowed to watch the same shows as others so I didn’t have anything interesting to say, and then it just kept on going until everyone just mocked everything about me. Then it got to the point where they were betting money on how long it would take to make me angry, their parents told my parents and my teachers but none did anything. Then once when a teacher told me off in front of the class for “don’t be rude to other people!” I started crying and the next day I find out that apparently my classmates were spamming “OP was crying! OP was crying!” because I always held it in but then I finally snapped.

When I changed school I went to another country for that (mother came along as I wasn’t old enough yet) and there I was mostly left alone but there were people who bullied me because of my nationality (they didn’t like outsiders at that school, especially the teachers) so I decided to just hang in there, I passed my exams, got decent grades and returned home. 

Then the pandemic hit so I can’t travel anywhere and since what I’m studying requires you to actually be there physically so online doesn’t work for my subject.

So now I’m just stuck, I have no one and my mother is slowly driving me insane and with today’s fight I’m feeling even worse, I’ve been contemplating suicide a lot, I tried cutting but got scared so instead I cut up my leg, I tried hanging but got scared so stopped last minute, and now I actually got a pack of sleeping pills and was thinking of ending it that way, no pain and no worries. Though one thing is stopping me and that is my dog, I got him when I returned home, just a little bit before the pandemic, he’s the reason I’m still alive since I doubt my family would care for him once I’m gone, but now I don’t think even my boi will be enough to stop me. I trained my dog to be very well behaved so most likely it will be easy to find him a good home, maybe even my brother would take him in since he has a kid who likes dogs. 

I don’t really know what’s the point of this post but I just want to make it anyway, maybe someone here will tell me something that can keep me going hopefully, I’m scared of dying but at the same time I don’t want to endure this anymore. I think I’d be doing everyone a favour by dying, my family won’t be hurt at all, and I have no one else who worries about me, so logically this is the best option for me. I’m kinda hoping someone here will be able to change my mind even a tiny bit.

Painless ways to end it? Failing final year of high school,"I have played the scenario thousands of times over in my mind and my death would improve the lives of just about everyone I could think of, if they even notice I’m gone.

I’m failing high school in senior year and have never had a job, I’m impressively unintelligent and not even “street smart”. Every time my friends invite me to hangout I am a constant drag and I feel like they feel obligated to invite me along but really don’t want to.

no one really cares,"i don’t think anyone actually cares about what i’m going through. to have my entire world crushed in the palm of my hand, watching everything i held close to my heart turn to ashes. my memories becoming clouded by an evil darkness and fading with each passing day. i’ve lost sight of the path through this void, which was once well defined. to lose all aspirations and goals, what left is there for me in this world. 

having my so called “friends and family” practically erased from my memory, i have no where else to turn. all because of one naive mistake. causing everything i knew of this reality to break. my head feels foggy and ridden with guilt, with peace only coming once under the quilt. i don’t know why i’m turning this into a poem. just feels right when nothing else matters. anyway, i want to overdose to ease this pain i’m faced with every waking moment of my life. everyone thinks i’m over reacting and treating a paper cut like a lethal wound, only if they could see inside my mind would they realize what horrors i’ve been condemned to endure. 

i know ive said some similar stuff on here in the past but i’m falling deeper into the depths of depression, i might actually go through with it this time.

My parents destroyed my social life,"From when I was born my parents would never let me go outside, have friends, do some kind of sport , NOTHING 
and this lead-up to me being 18 having little to no social skills. I can't talk good, extremely hard for me to make friends.

I see 16 yr in the Internet who have already built up their life and me here struggling to get a taxi me here struggling to ride a bike me here struggling to talk to anyone.
I will never forgive my parents ever and if it weren't for my Islamic religion I would have killed my self age ago

27 years of abuse,"I have been abused sexually, physically, and psychologically for almost my entire life, starting at birth and stopping at 20. For the past 7 years I’ve just abused myself. I am haunted by the trauma every day. All of it just replays in my head over and over again. For years I shut it out with alcohol, but I haven’t drank in a year. I’ve just stewed with my own thoughts day after day and it’s only been worse since this fucking pandemic. Due to all the abuse I now have borderline pd, CPTSD, anxiety, and treatment resistant major depression. My mom severely abused me and my father for my entire childhood and adolescence. I also watched my parents kick, scream at, and even try to kill my pets as a small child. I hate myself so much for it but I ended up killing two of the pets so they wouldn’t have to suffer anymore. At 18 within a span of 6 months my grandpa who was like a second father to me died, my mom killed our other dog, tried to kill herself, I was raped for a second time, and I lost my childhood home. I have been raped 3 times, twice by “boyfriends” and once by an older man who groomed me at 16. I also suspect I was molested by an uncle as a child who would say weird sexual shit to me to scare me. 

So now I’m a 27 year old sober junkie, alcoholic, unable to function on any significant level. I wish I just killed myself by drinking bleach when I was 12 like I wanted to. I have spent my whole life wanting to die. I can’t fucking take it anymore.

I don't want to be gay anymore.,"I'm so tired all of the time. Everyday I struggle with feeling worthless.

After coming out of the closet, I was excited to build connections with other gay men... They just aren't interested in me. 

I'm lonely all of the time even though I live in a big city and in a ""gayborhood"". I'm constantly ignored... rejected... or ghosted by the very men who promoted ""acceptance and equality"".

I've started doing research for conversion therapy, but it's all stems from religion. And I don't want to be Christian again just to be non-gay.

I hate this community. I hate the people in it. I hate the fakeness. The racism in this community. I hate the body shaming, ableism, and ageism in this community. I don't want to be a part of it anymore.

I don't even really want to live anymore. I'm so tired of trying. In a weird way, I find death kind of comforting.

Stress is making me want to kill my self,"I have always dealt with suicidal ideation and I thought that if I got a puppy I’d be so much happier. Although the opposite has occurred. The endless amounts of attention and needs of the puppy has caused my anxiety to hit an all time high, and i am even having a hard time taking care of my own needs now. (Basic self care necessities.) every night I wake up thinking how am I going to train this dog if I’ve never had one or just constantly worrying about the future. I am worrying to the point where my head is hurting.
I cry every day now and I am just completely miserable at the moment.
And not to mention I am a senior in high school and have no idea what I want to do now, I was going to get into the military or at least try to; but after seeing videos of boot camp I feel like I cannot do it. Especially since I do have OCD... 
and now I’m not sure what to do with my future.. 

I’ve had suicidal thoughts but never to this extent, where my family tells me they will be very devastated if I take my life, yet I don’t feel much guilt. And that absolutely kills me too.
Every time I think of suicide it gives me relief.
Call me weak or what you will, I’ve already accepted myself to be weak.. I can’t even deal with a small responsibility such as a puppy how am I going to deal with real life?!

ending it all in less than 2 months,"sorry in advance for the long post and the giant block of text idk how to make it look pretty and easier to read, here's the story of my life and it's missing a lot of stuff but those are traumas I can't get myself to share.

basically ever since I was a kid i've always been really depressed and always isolated myself. I lost my dad when I was 3 and around the age of 7 I started thinking about suicide a lot. I would put myself at risk hoping that something would happen and I would die because I was always too much of a pussy to actually take things in my own hands, I would just be running in the middle of the road whenever I saw a car speeding and coming my way or a bus etc. I just wanted them to hit me and kill me but somehow they've always managed to avoid me, one time a guy even crashed while going over the speed limit because he tried to not run me over (no serious injury he was fine). after that i've always had a reckless behavior because I thought well maybe if i keep putting myself at risk like that surely something is gonna happen eventually and i'll finally be free ? so I kept doing that while growing up, I also kept isolating myself and eventually dropped out and was sent to a psych ward after a failed suicide attempt. I took random pills i found in my moms stash and hoped it would be enough but she caught me while I was almost done swallowing the last few pills. I spent a few months in the psych ward but it felt like an eternity and while I was in there they put me on a lot of different medications, one of them was xanax. after I managed to lie and convince the therapists that I was doing ok now they finally set me free and I was sent back home but by that time i had already dropped out of school and I was doing worse mentally than I was before the psych ward. so I started abusing the medications that were prescribed to me especially xanax, I would knock myself out and blackout for days and then go see my psychiatrist and tell him yeah I don't know I must have lost my meds somehow or I lost the prescription just so he would make me another one and I could go ahead and abuse them even more. I would take the amount I was prescribed for a month in maybe one to three days depending on how I felt, eventually he started getting suspicious and called my mom and she told him than I've been abusing my meds and not taking the ones that were supposed to be beneficial for me at all. so they sent me back to the psych ward once again, they didn't give me any xanax this time but just the meds that were supposed to turn me into a ""normal"" human being, none of them worked and if anything some of them gave me strength i never had to actually go thru with things and kill myself. so they cut out all those medications again and tried once again new pills, this time I figured if I wanted to get out of this place once again I would have to cheat and lie, so I did. I would not swallow my pills and throw them out and I would pretend they were working and I was feeling better, it worked and they let me out once again. I'll also mention while i'm at it that I spent new years eve and my birthday at the psych ward with no family that ever came to visit me. I was always allowed 1 hour of hanging out with my family if someone came to visit me but no one ever came. all those events happened from when I was 15 years old for the dropout of school and I just turned 20 when I got out of the psych ward the second time. I was home most of the time it was just a few months in those 5 years that I actually spent at the ward but when I wasn't there I was still suicidal and thinking about dying all the time. I never had many friends and I lost most of them, I'm not even sad about that but i'm actually more sad that the few friends that I have left that were there with me thru everything are still strangers to me and just people I can't relate to or be myself around. my ""best friend"" that i've known for 10 years actually never let me down and was always there for me no matter how down bad I was but despite everything I've never been able to truly open up to him or anyone about how I feel and who I really am. He think he knows me but in reality he has no idea of the person I am and how I feel, sometimes he tries to take me out so we can hang out with some people and I actually force myself to go but every time I just sit here surrounded by ""friends"" and despite that I still feel alone? I've always felt alone no matter who i've talked to or ""bonded"" with. around this time last year I met someone and for whatever reason I instantly actually enjoyed talking to that person it was the first time ever I actually felt not alone, and when I was talking to her it felt like everything was going to be fine and all my problems were suddenly something that didn't bother me or overwhelm me as much as it always does. we bonded really fast with each other and we were so alike it felt like all the stuff I went thru was some kind of challenge I had to endure just to have the chance to meet that person as some kind of reward for those 23 years of pain. she's the only person I was ever able to truly open up to and it was the first time I actually opened up to someone, she liked me for me and she's the only person I was ever able to be my real self around.we ended up falling in love and dating and I remember at first I thought this is too good to be true, it's a rollercoaster at one point it's gonna crash and it will be the death of me, I even told a ""friend"" that cares about me a lot(despite me not being able to care about that person or anyone else either) about it and she could see it herself that this was something really unique and some kind of bonding that didn't even seem real because of how unique it was and she told me ""if she leaves you, you'll be dead"" because my ""friend"" really understood how unique this was. but that thought went away really early on in our relationship when she also opened up to me and cried to me while saying how she genuinely felt about me and out of respect I won't say the stuff she told me but it wasn't just words that you tell someone when u get into a relationship it was deep and truly something that came from the bottom of her heart and i'm sure that she has never felt this way or said anything like that to anyone she has ever dated before me. after everything that was said I started trying my best to become someone better because for the first time in my life I actually wanted to grow old with that person and having a shitty boring life didn't mean much to me as long as I had her with me. we both felt the same way about everything it was really genuine but eventually she had a phase where she was stressed and wanted to be left alone, she didn't want to talk to me and for 2 weeks she would barely reply to me saying she just wanted to be alone for now because she felt down and stressed. I remember getting mad at her because she would ignore me and not want to talk to me but at the same time she would go out and hang out with her friends and talk to them all the time while not giving me any attention at all, she told me that she just felt empty and going out was just a way to change her mind and keep herself occupied so she wouldn't be stuck with her thoughts and that she was not talking to me and prefered hanging out with them because she felt empty and being with them was different since she doesn't have feelings for them. after those 2 weeks she broke up with me because she said in those 2 weeks where she wanted to be alone she lost all her feelings for me and everyone else, but considering the people she used to hang out with all day during that time are now really close to her it's easy to figure out it's just me she lost feelings for. after that she tried to reach up to me and tried to make us stay friends but most of the time it would end up in us arguing because I had too many questions about everything and she either gave answers that made no sense to me or said ""not everything in life makes sense"". I told her I hoped one day her feelings would come back and everything would be fine again but I doubt it, to which she replied something like ""I don't know that and neither do you"" or ""you can't predict the future"". and every time I mentioned I would wait for her forever because she was and she still is the only person that could ever make me feel whole, things got worse and all of a sudden things went from maybe my feelings will come back maybe they wont to ""I don't think they ever will"" ""move on because I will"" ""don't wait for me you'll be disappointed and it stresses me out even more"". but what hurts the most out of all the stuff that was said is that she said multiple times that i'm the right person for her it was just and still is the wrong time, and that's when I started getting really mean to her and everytime she would try to text me to be friends I would just get really angry and I would be mean to her. I even told her multiple times how can you say i'm the right person for you and then tell me literally in the next sentence ""but you should move on because i will"" you don't believe i'm the right person if that's how you see things, but no she kept telling me that i'm the right person again and again, it didn't matter how many times I screamed at her or flamed her for it she kept insisting. she also said I was the best person she ever met even after the breakup she kept saying that, one night after she tried once again to reach out to me to be friends and on good terms despite me screaming at her and being really mean as always she said those exact words ""you're the best person I know and i'll always care about you"". when we were together she used to say it all the time as well and even before we caught feelings for each other, she always told me I was the best person she had ever met, eventually after weeks or months of her trying to be my friend and me pushing her away each time she said ""will things always be like this between us"" and said it made her feel sad and angry so i eventually gave in and said sure let's try to be friends I guess I don't really have the will power or energy left to scream at you if that makes you feel any better. ever since then it's been terrible because we don't talk much even tho she says she wants us to be really close friends like we were at first before any feelings were involved, she doesn't open up, if i try to make a convo and ask what she's doing today she refuses to tell me, she pretty much just refuses to tell me anything about her life because that's none of my business anymore. a lot of the stuff she says and she promise me she means it just sounds so fake because her actions are literally the opposite. not too long ago when I was pushing her away she kept saying I was the best person she knows but after having a talk about her so i could maybe get some insight on how she feels because like I said most of the stuff she says doesn't align with her actions she now said ""you're one of the best, but not the best person i know"". it's funny how things change so fast and how as soon as I gave in and literally tried my best to hurt in silence and not show her how i felt inside so i wouldn't make her feel sad or bad i now mean less than I did when I was just pushing her away and screaming at her. when she broke up with me she also mentioned she doesn't like being in a relationship because of those phases where she feels empty and just wants to be alone and she said she doesn't want a relationship or anything in her life for now, but after getting mad at her she eventually told me she's been talking to someone lately and she's right it's none of my business but it sounds really wrong and fucked up when she said she didn't want any relationship in her life for now when breaking up with me and considering every promises she has ever made me and everything she has ever told me in the past. I remember being really insecure about someone in her life, just a coworker that she met one day while we were still dating and they became somewhat friends just at work but one night a few weeks after that maybe she told me he tried to flirt with her and that she thinks he likes her and she said ""doesn't know I have a bf i guess i'll let him know"", i got mad about that guy and she said ""chill i didn't go along with it"", and I know she would have never cheated on me but I couldn't help being jealous. eventually they started hanging out together as friends more and more and I would get insecure about it and I would tell her and also remind her of that one time he tried to flirt, and now she kept telling me he wasn't trying to flirt it's not like that it was just a misunderstanding he's not interested in me and neither am I, but to me what that guy told her literally was flirting and i'm not sure how she convinced herself it wasn't when she's the one that told me about it and called it flirting in the first place. they kept getting closer to the point where nowadays he's her best friend and they're really close, that's something I got mad at her for and screamed at her for one night because I told myself yeah she dumped me and now she's going out with the one guy I was literally insecure about. but no she told me they're really close friends but it's not like that and that's how she told me she's been talking to someone she said i've been talking to someone but no him so stop assuming things. but does it even matter, I used to be her best friend before we caught feelings for each other and then I was also her boyfriend, those 2 spots were mine and now none of them is. I got replaced, and i'll slowly become a memory that she will eventually erase from her brain. I've always hated myself so how can I blame her for wanting to be with someone else? I never understood why she loved me, especially with everything she said it wasn't just the type of love from some random relationship, it was love in it's purest form. it's hard to explain without context on everything she promised and used to say back then and I know it sounds like just any breakup but it's really not and I know saying this also sounds like what every person would say as soon as they get out of a relationship but once again trust me it's really not. she's the only person I've ever cared about and I still care about her to this day more than anything, that's something that will never change. It was her or nobody until the end and i'll stand by that no matter what. I wasn't abusing drugs when I met her I would sometimes take something just to have fun but rarely and that's how she used drugs as well, and when we were together we would sometimes take something together but in a responsible way and not often. after the breakup and everything tho I started abusing drugs daily and in stupid dosages, I wanted to be numb and not feel anything because when I was sober the pain I was feeling was so much worse than I thought it could ever be. I can't describe how much it hurts and even tho I was depressed and suicidal my whole life and had a really low point where I lost a family member and was in the worst pain i could have ever imagined, I never thought it could get worse and when I look at myself today and how I hurt daily and what my thoughts are constantly during the day i'm genuinely amazed at how bad everything is. but yeah I abused drugs a lot, ended up in the hospital around 3 times in a month because I was od'ing, my heart from a medical point of view is in a really shitty condition due to the drug abuse and apparently it will take a really long time to heal from what i've been told, but even if it does heal that won't heal my sorrows and everything else so I couldn't care less. when she heard about it tho she asked me to stop taking drugs and even tho my life is literally hell right now because I lost her I still promised her I would stop taking drugs because at the end of the day she's the only person I care about and I can't get myself to say no to her, so I did and i've been sober for around 2 weeks now. without the drugs tho, things are worse because I have to actually face everything daily without any interruption. i've never wanted to kill myself more than I do nowadays and there's not a single day that goes by where I don't prepare everything and get ready to do it and then I just sit here looking at all the pills from my drug stash with all the deadly combinations and insane dosages i could take and mix to make sure I die for good this time and it takes all the strength I have in me to not go for it. I sit for hours watching all the pills, counting the dosages, making sure mixing those and those are lethal and even if some of those don't interact with each other I know that a mix of so many drugs and in such a retarded dosage is for sure going to kill me. and I want to do it, more than ever and I'm always so close to doing it but then I tell myself if I die would she even care? would she even notice? and the thing that has been stopping me so far is the fact that if I do go thru with it and she somehow finds out about it, there's a possibility she'll be sad and there's a possibility she'll blame herself and I don't want to hurt her despite the fact that she hurt me more than anyone or anything has ever did. I don't want her to live her life thinking this was her fault but then again maybe it wouldn't phase her at all and if it did maybe she would get over it really fast just like she did with me. but I can't anymore, it just gets worse and worse every day and it's getting harder and harder to stop myself from doing it, so i'll finally go thru with but I'll do my best to try and survive for the next 2 months. I want to do it at a special date and in 2 months there's 2 events in particular that sound to me like it will be the right time to do it, there's my birthday and a few days after that there's the date where she first admitted to me she loved me, so i'll pick one of these two to end it all if I can even manage to hold on for that long. don't get me wrong i've always been suicidal and i've attempted suicide a few times before I even met her, this isn't her fault, it's just a mix of everything that has ever happened, I was abused as a kid, I've seen 2 out of the 3 people that ever mattered to me die and the third one just made empty promises and hurt me more than anything ever did and now that she's gone it's time to put an end to everything. I managed to survive for 23 almost 24 years somehow but now I just can't keep going anymore. I'm not sure why I wrote all of this I didn't even want this to be a long essay at first but I needed to get this off my chest. it doesn't really matter if anyone takes the time to read this or not and if someone does, please don't come at me with stuff like ""hang in there"" ""it gets better"" ""you'll find someone else"" ""you can focus on making ur future better"" ""you're just heartbroken it will go away eventually"" ""time heals wounds"" blablabla I really don't care and like I said i know this looks and sounds like just another heartbreak and eventually i'll move on but I can assure you that everything before her already made me want to end my life and that now it's a billion times worse than it has ever been because she was truly the one and only and the bond we had was something I had never seen anyone else experience before and it would be impossible to properly describe it. I've tried to kill myself multiple times when I was happier than this, nowadays everything is much worse than I could have ever imagined. so yeah that's it I guess, I hope no one ever has to experience the way I feel and if you made it to the end thank you for taking the time out of your life to read the tragedy that is my life, there's a lot of stuff that wasn't said and traumas that I don't want to get into but I can't be bothered anymore.",crescnt,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jywp4r/ending_it_all_in_less_than_2_months/,sorry advance long post giant block text

And thoughts like “I can’t go on another day” or “I’m a burden on ...”  , “I’ve tried EVERYTHING and nothing seems to be working” it takes A LOT of thought to actually come to that decision to check out, it’s not for fun.

I'm tired and I don't want to feel like this anymore.,"This is a throwaway account but I have posted on this sub several times before. I'm so fed up, I'm tired. I've had deppression and anxiety since I was a child and I'm 28 now. Although my anxiety and panic attacks have improved my deppression never has. I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder last year, was put on meds and then that was it. My next appointment with the therapist was cancelled twice and I missed the rescheduled one so now I'm not a patient anymore. I feel like no one really gives a shit. Everytime I go to the doctors they just add more meds or up my dose, I've done so much counseling and therapy im tired of it all. 

This year has been hard. Someone I knew killed themselves earlier this year and even though we weren't very close (dated them briefly) I still think about it everyday. 

People always say that of you end it now you'll miss out on all the good things life has to offer in the future. But I've been suicidal since I was a teenager and I honestly kinda wish I had just ended it then. I've got a lot of meds and I think if I took them all that might be enough, but I don't want my house mates to find me. There is a woods near my house I could go to.

The only reason I’m still here is my crippling incapability of overcoming stagnation.,"I can’t change anything in my life. I’ve lived the same life for years now. Nothing ever changes. Nothing ever progresses. I feel like I’m actively, yet somehow unknowingly, restricting myself from overcoming this crippling stagnation.

It’s almost like I don’t dare to make a change, even though I so passionately long for it? I want a divorce. I want to move states. I want a complete and entire personality make-over. I want to go to therapy. I want to be my own person. But I can’t.

The last four years have been a nightmare. I got married pretty young, I moved to a place I never wanted to move to. I did a lot of things to please others and I pretty much lost my own will during the process.

Since then, life has been dull. I haven’t left the house alone in over four years. I have lost all of my friends. I’ve been isolated and my anxieties have skyrocketed. I can’t do anything on my own anymore. It’s not that my husband wouldn’t let me - at all. It’s more like I lost the capability to. I’m scared of everything.

I want to change so many things in my life but I cannot do it. I cannot change. I feel like I am trapped within myself. I can’t even take my own life because I feel like that would be too much responsibility. Because I cannot make big decisions for my own life - or death for that matter. I’m not scared of death. But I can’t escape the stagnation.",deafkittenpoetry,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jyvqg5/the_only_reason_im_still_here_is_my_crippling/,change anything life lived life year nothing ever change nothing ever progress feel like actively yet somehow unknowingly restricting overcoming crippling stagnation almost like dare make change even though passionately long want divorce want move state want complete entire personality make want go therapy want person last four year nightmare got married pretty young moved place never wanted move lot thing please others pretty much lost process since life ha dull left house alone four year lost friend isolated anxiety skyrocketed anything anymore husband let like lost capability scared everything want change many thing life cannot cannot change feel like trapped within even take life feel like would much responsibility cannot make big decision life death matter scared death escape stagnation,reason still crippling incapability overcoming stagnation,deaf kitten poetry,1374,85,deaf kitten poetry change anything life lived life year nothing ever change nothing ever progress feel like actively yet somehow unknowingly restricting overcoming crippling stagnation almost like dare make change even though passionately long want divorce want move state want complete entire personality make want go therapy want person last four year nightmare got married pretty young moved place never wanted move lot thing please others pretty much lost process since life ha dull left house alone four year lost friend isolated anxiety skyrocketed anything anymore husband let like lost capability scared everything want change many thing life cannot cannot change feel like trapped within even take life feel like would much responsibility cannot make big decision life death matter scared death escape stagnation reason still crippling incapability overcoming stagnation
I've never posted here before... But I need some support,"And I'll most likely take it down... But I'm feeling suicidal urges I haven't felt in years. Around five years ago, I was really, really ready to go. I didn't want to keep being here any longer.

Since then, I've gotten treatment and I'm on an antidepressant and meds for my panic attacks. But recently with the pandemic and pressure at work and being treated poorly by the people around me has just... zapped my motivation to stay here. This isn't sustainable. I don't know how I'm supposed to live out the next 50-60 years of my life like this.

The only things keeping me here are the reactions of others... Especially my parents. Even though they are some of the people who treat me the worst, I know losing me would break them. And fear. That's a big one. I don't know what's on the other side.

I know this is vague, but I don't want to give away too much about my identity just in case. But right now work is impossible, the pressure is too much and I have no social life because of it, and my parents are my closest support system and they are so often unkind and unsupportive and unwilling to deal with my mental illnesses. They actively get mad when I show symptoms, even when I try to explain to them that I am irrational and coping the best I can. I'm an adult (28), but they still act like they know my brain better than I do. 

I don't know why I'm writing this. I don't have any plans or anything. But I know I can't tell my family, friends or therapist that I'm feeling like this lest I get baker acted... So here I am.

I’m afraid of life after death,"My boyfriend passed away in June suddenly and tragically. My family is poor. I don’t have any ambitions or aspirations in life because I don’t dream of working for the rest of my life. I smoke pretty often but it doesn’t smooth the loneliness I feel 24/7. I want to make it and become successful as a way to rub it into my peers faces. But at the same time, I just can’t take living anymore.

I just know that some people will be happy especially because a lot of people blame me for my bf’s death. The thing is, I’m extremely afraid of death. I’m afraid what happens after. I have a few theories but no one actually knows. 

I’ve had about 3 suicide attempts, one of them put me in a coma and I was expected to die and I wish I had then and there so I wouldn’t know. I know a drug dealer that can hook my up w some tabs and xans. And then I can get alcohol.

I come from a culture that doesn't really recognise mental illnesses and especially not the thoughts of suicide, except well 2 uncles of mine died from suicide but still, my dad does not seem he wants to open the topic yet denies it. Maybe it runs in the family, idk. and I usually have these thoughts around the exam periods and tmr I've got a maths exam and I can't seem to focus one bit when revising and the stress is really getting to me. also, my older sister, a cousin and 3 friends know about my situation but I feel like my friends think I'm doing it for attention or something??? I literally only told them because I cried in front of them and I had to tell someone. when I told my sister she told me if I wanted to speak to a counsellor at school or a therapist and I really want to but around where I live apparently suicide is not something to speak of as often and it would be too embarrassing for me to tell another person especially my parents because my mum would lose it like she always does like she'd faint on the spot and well my dad...idk.

I can't bid farewell to my loved ones since they'd try to stop me and a letter isn't enough to tell them how much I love them and explain how much this pain is killing me on the inside how many nights and days I've spent crying.

Thank you for letting me have a platform where I can express myself anonymously without being judged too much.

"I'm so tired, but I've got the perfect plan.","Nitrogen is a great gas, with a couple of backups to make sure I follow through. I'm exhausted. This shit has absolutely made me go insane. I can't sleep. I thought the cat would let me find some sort of reason to stay and provide for something, but she didn't. Day after day I fuck up and find myself absolutely ready to kill myself but every time I get right up to it, I don't fucking do it. I always skip out and decide that I should wait. Why can't I do it? Why am I such a pussy? Why can't God just fucking end me? What I wouldn't do to run off of the bridge on the drive home, or to be shot in some freak accident. Why do I have to suffer through this bullshit, simply because others would be sad? Did they give enough fucks while I was here for it to warrant that claim? They say they care but they flake out. They never check up on me. Four years I dedicated to fostering these fucking friends and they never talk to me. They talked shit behind my back and I did my absolute best to be good to them. I drove them everywhere. I payed for their meals when they couldn't, and never asked for them to pay it back. I fucking put grass in his yard, pulled stumps, put up a fence, all free of charge. I talked him down from his depressive episodes, and hyped him up when he decided to give up, I picked up their shifts, I drove his sister to school on my last couple of dollars because no one else could. I never asked for a fucking cent, and I was disposable to him. Why? I did everything right, didn't I? He said he wanted more independence, but fuck, he just left without anything. I have no one to talk to but my gf, but it hurts her. She gets upset and angry, for good reason, but still. I can't fucking take this shit anymore. I can take any of it anymore. I hate it here. I hate being alive. I hate having to deal with school and work, and family, and my mental health. If God won't kill me, I fucking will. I saved up to pay all my debt, and my fucking funeral bill. I'm done. Please God, give me the strength to follow through. I doubt anyone who cares will see this, but if they do: I only hope you go to sleep fucking sick thinking about how you care only when I'm fucking gone, like I'm some sort of fucking painter. Fuck this, and fuck this fucking world. I hate to be so negative, but Christ, I would like some semblance of mental safety. I've lost interest in everything. She blames herself for my shortcomings, and thinks that she's not enough. Stupid. I can't believe she burdened herself with that. I can't believe she said she wished she never got involved.

We put him in a box and kept him in the other room for now. I have the urge to just go there and check if somehow he's magically alive. I know it won't happen but I wanna check, just in case.

I'm so sad. I miss him more than anything, but at least I know he's not suffering anymore. He was basically screaming while we were giving him his medicine right before he passed. I really hope there's a special place for pets where they can be happy forever.

I think I figured out why I've been chronically suicidal for the past 7 years or so,"I'm currently waiting on VA disability so I have all the time in the world to sit around and think rn.

I was looking at old pictures of myself and friends that I used to have, and I'm pretty sure I mentally died or lost my soul or something in my early 20s. Idk how to explain it (I'm 28 rn). I think my body wants to make it right and follow suit.

Looking at them should bring me happiness from those great memories but they only make me inexplicably and deeply sad.

I thought I had this under control a few years ago, but its all come crashing down. Realizing I'm useless without being able to work. I have no real friends today, and all but one of my past friends have anything to do with me. I reach out but I can tell they don't want to talk to me.

March 10th, 2017. 26y/o My brother overdosed and died in his sleep.

December 26, 2019. 21y/o My husband's brother was killed in a car crash the day after Christmas, he has 2 kids.

June 9th, 2020. 25y/o My battle I deployed with, he took his own life a year after we got back home.

I'm tired of seeing people die when my worthless ass is still alive. Its cruel.

I somehow managed to get re-married after a really fucking hard divorce(was my best friend at the time and we were together 7 years, his family was always so affectionate, it made me feel good. But we brought out the worst in each other. Leaving was one of the hardest things I've ever done, but I knew it was best for the both of us). My current spouse is so sweet and patient I don't feel like I deserve him.  I feel like I tricked him into a relationship with me and I'm draining his happiness the same way I did my ex. He tries his best but for some reason I can't change and that's what hurts the most.

I wish I could get rid of these feelings and just be happy.

A few years ago, work running and the gym took up most of my free time and now my back is so fucking messed up I can hardly even walk right.

I feel like I've just hurt everyone I've ever come into contact with, I'm the only common denominator.

I wish I could just have my memories wiped or just stop existing. I feel like the ragged old dog that needs to be put down, but the owner doesn't want to because hes so used to the dog being around.

I'm currently on 5 different psych meds, and I talk to a therapist once a week. But its somehow still not enough to make me normal. My meds STRICTLY say not to drink alcohol, but I'm now drowning my sorrows with some cheap vodka and sunny-d. This post has taken a while to write.

\-I try really really hard to not let anyone know how bad my mental illnesses are or anything going on like this whole post, but I just needed to type it out. I don't mean at all for it to be attention seeking.- If worse comes to worst I guess this can serve as a suicide note. If I were to finally take my own life it would be considered a ""shock"" that ""no one saw coming"". Sorry to all who've had the misfortune to know me.

"I don’t want to get any older, so suicide seems like the best option.","I’m 29 and wasted the past decade or more doing nothing. My friends never wanted to do anything or go anywhere. So we just played Xbox every week. Looking back on it, I fucking hate it. Such a complete waste of time. Everyday has been the same day again and again. I’ve never been out past midnight, or to any kind of “party”. 

Now they all have houses and kids. So any hope of things changing is gone. On top of that, older people get judged for being out all night as irresponsible or creepy. You’re either judged for hanging out with people younger than you, or just part of boring older people. Fuck all that. I rather be dead now and never have to think about what I missed. People that die young are always remembered that way. Not the older version of themselves. 

So much other bad shit has happened to get me here. Year after year of horrible situations that would take way too long to write out. But this one is  unfixable. There’s no going back. I don’t want a future of owning a house and being in bed by 10. 

I think about suicide everyday. I think normal people don’t even have that word cross their mind. Until it’s on the news or someone they know. Maybe a couple times a year at most. I’ve thought about it everyday for years. But I’ve been too weak to do it. I hope before I’m 30 that fear goes away.

One and a half years ago, I was psychologically abused manipulated by my girlfriends parents. I lived with her parents for a few months, and the whole time I was led to question my reality and if I was good enough for my girlfriend. It all blew up and I couch surfed for about a week before signing a lease with my girlfriend. I don’t trust her parents, and I don’t think I’ll ever be able to. Thing is she’s practically married to them. I hate it when she brings them up because I have flashbacks so the abuse which can cause me severe anxiety, but she brings them up all the time. I’m a shell of my former self because I’m so tired of experiencing anxiety and stress. I can’t talk to her about it because she instantly gets defensive, so I just distract myself with videogames and books. 

I can’t bring myself to leave because I love her with all of my heart. I fear my depression will only get worse. I feel alone in the world, and I don’t even have her support anymore. All that’s left for me is me, and I don’t know if that is enough to keep me going.",yeehee23,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jyws13/not_suicidal_but_ive_really_been_feeling_the/,general anxiety disorder trust issue someone wrong manipulates trust second chance want opportunity taken advantage ha led closing lot people one half year ago wa psychologically abused manipulated girlfriend parent lived parent month whole time wa led question reality wa good enough girlfriend blew couch surfed week signing lease girlfriend trust parent think ever able thing practically married hate brings flashback abuse cause severe anxiety brings time shell former self tired experiencing anxiety stress talk instantly get defensive distract videogames book bring leave love heart fear depression get worse feel alone world even support anymore left know enough keep going,suicidal really feeling stress life lately idk depressed feel like getting worse,yee hee 23,1322,135,yee hee 23 general anxiety disorder trust issue someone wrong manipulates trust second chance want opportunity taken advantage ha led closing lot people one half year ago wa psychologically abused manipulated girlfriend parent lived parent month whole time wa led question reality wa good enough girlfriend blew couch surfed week signing lease girlfriend trust parent think ever able thing practically married hate brings flashback abuse cause severe anxiety brings time shell former self tired experiencing anxiety stress talk instantly get defensive distract videogames book bring leave love heart fear depression get worse feel alone world even support anymore left know enough keep going suicidal really feeling stress life lately idk depressed feel like getting worse

I just need someone to know,"I'm a 21M and have never told anyone the extent of the times I've been close to killing myself and just need to get them out. The first time I was after my friend unexpectedly died when I was 19. In the months after, I don't remember any of it until I was standing on a bridge trying to gain the confidence to throw myself off of it. I can't listen to Breezeblocks now without that night going through my head. The next time was when I was on vacation with my family on a cruise. I hate being with my family and it was during the winter when the lack of schoolwork gives me more time to think of comitting. I was drunk and standing on 11th floor balcony looking at the ocean waves crashing. I remember I couldn't hear anything around me. Just the voice in my head telling me to do it fast, but I didn't. The next time was when I was 20 during the 5 months of my life when I was addicted to oxy. I was laying on the floor of room sweating and dissociating for about 3 hours. I had a blade right by me as I was trying to figure out how to go thru with it and what would happen, but my old friend texted me and I unloaded everything on her. That was the first night I came out as bi to anyone. That same year during winter break on New Years night once again on vacation with my family, I was drunk and listening to Cavetown out on the deck sitting on top of the ocean. I wanted to roll in and just sink and was damn close to it. The good news i guess is that was the last time, but the first half of this year was filled with drinking and being catatonic while the second has been filled with working from 8AM to 2AM every weekday and drinking on the weekends. I've never been able to tell anyone since I'm just the darling child going to be a doctor one day and the top of my program in college when in reality when I see myself, I only think about how I've been having suicidal thoughts since I was 12 and only survive by working hard enough to be too tired to kill myself.

"I lost my best friend a couple weeks ago when she took her life, it made me realize a lot of things","Since I was 12, I’ve been extremely suicidal. This year alone I’ve tried more times than I can count. Between drinking bleach, pills, hanging, etc, it’s been a lot. The only person that knew the extent of it was my best friend who we’ll call Sara. Sara was the only one I would talk to about how bad it was. She was the only one who understood bc she was going through it too. I loved her. She took her life a few days before Halloween. The last convo that we had was her saying her thoughts were getting worse. I tried to be there for her.... but I guess it wasn’t enough. 

Since then I’ve come to realize how much it affects everyone. People who knew her only in passing felt the hurt everyone has been feeling. For me the part of my heart that was dedicated to her will forever be injured. I still send her messages and memes that I think she would find funny. I see that delivered marker and know it’ll never change to read. I had a dream that it did and when I woke up and realized it was only a dream I broke down. 

Since her passing though, I’ve changed everything. I stopped drinking as much and I go into everything with the same positivity she had. She was always this ray of bright light no matter how badly she was hurting on the inside, I plan to bring that light with me now. It also put into perspective all my issues and how minuscule it really is. I like to think she’s still with me helping me with everything. I’ve experienced such good luck since she left us. I feel bad for feeling happy and blessed bc she can’t experience it with me.. but I feel like she is and that she’s the reason for it. It sounds weird, but I really do feel it. I love her and always will. I miss her immensely, but I don’t think she’s fully gone.

"The dog is the only thing keeping me here, and she's old","I realize many people have it worse than me, but I'm ready to leave it. I have a wife who loves me but I know she wants kids and fatherhood would absolutely break me. I got laid off from my high-paying job at the start of COVID and started a consulting business that's actually thriving. I'm making good money again, doing it at home in my sweatpants, and everything about running a business makes me absolutely miserable and I just want a boss and less responsibility.

Also, my brand new computer decided to stop connecting to the wi-fi today so I had to switch to my old laptop, which barely works. Not only am I going to have to spend money and risk COVID getting it fixed, it's going to take me much longer to do my work on the old computer this week and I'm really annoyed about that already. Time is money, and I'm taking a pay cut because fuck me right. 

Anyway, hard to see the stress level going down anytime soon or ever. Being the world's most reluctant entrepreneur, I feel like I'm always on the clock and hate every second of it. I've traveled the world, had some crazy times and some fun experiences. Fortunate to cross most everything off my bucket list while I was young and healthy.

My wife deserves better, and I owe it to her to stick around long enough to leave her in as good of a financial spot as I can. My parents are carefree rich people with very easy lives who shower their patronage on some of their kids, but I wouldn't know. 

I've spent time in therapy and really tried. I have plenty of friends, exercise regularly and do all the bullshit that's supposed to make you high on life. But I know myself pretty well at this point, and I'm just not a person I like and want to spend a lot more time with. Also, I'm pretty sure my home country of America is well into its decline, and it's no fun to be on a sinking ship.

Can I just die?," 

I've been suicidal for more than half my life now, and I feel like it should be recognized as enough time for me to understand and consider all the risks and make an informed decision. I hate numerous arguments people make because I've already considered them all and found a refutation. I totally understand a spur of the moment suicide should not be encouraged for obvious reasons, but for others like me; the circumstances are different and it arguably will not change due to a combination of mental and circumstantial factors.

Before I jump into anything I just want to recognize: I understand that I am very privileged and that my reasons to die would be trivial at best. I was recently called a loser for having the mindset that I have, which I understand, because it's true: I lost at life and now I'm talking the shortcut out. I guess my life has been so shallow to this point that these problems are enough to get me, but I'm too tired to even bother defending my ego.

First of all, the fact that suicide is an inherently selfish act is true, just like every thing else we do. Yes, me wanting to die to ""feel better,"" is selfish I suppose, but isn't just like ignoring a toxic person &amp; moving far, far away? Yes, I recognize I'm hurting people around me, but my logic is: those people hurt me first by making me feel this way and they are continuing to also be selfish by keeping me here in pain.

I also want to recognize that my circumstances will not get better because of my mental set. Unhappiness aggregates. Though I know I have been happy and I can be fleetingly happy in the future, we humans have been evolutionarily programmed to see pretty much only the negative. I *can't* imagine a time when I was happy in the past-- and trust me I know I have been happy. It's just that I'm afraid of the pain that's inevitably going to come and none of the ups in life can ever compare.

Finally, I think me being alive won't amount to much. Sure, if I really tried I could do something with myself. But do I really want to go through that effort? There's no benefit to me doing anything really. If I become a famous actor or a scientist, nothing would change. I'd still end up 6 feet under whether now or 60 years later. I've been told this nihilist attitude will get me nowhere, but based on those principles so will changing my attitude too.

Suicide a shortcut. We've beat the system. People will always complain and societal stigmas stemming from an evolutionary background will always persist. But who cares? We won't be around to hear their complaints if everything works out.

I don’t want to be here without my baby,"My second child was stillborn at full term last month. I don’t want to live anymore. I love my husband and my first child so much but the pain of living without my second is too much for me. I feel like a murderer. Babies are supposed to be born. It’s supposed to be easy to take care of a baby while you’re pregnant. Why couldn’t I do it? I go over and over all the things that could have caused it and how I could have prevented it. There was nothing wrong with my baby. It has to be me. I felt less movement and I didn’t go to the hospital. I can make excuses but it doesn’t matter. That’s it. It’s my fault. And I don’t deserve to live because my baby is dead. I killed my baby. My baby didn’t deserve to die but it happened because of me. Maybe I’m a coward for not wanting to live with the guilt but it’s too painful. 

I don’t have a plan. So far I just hit and slap myself when no one can see or hear me, but bruises aren’t enough. I keep getting weird feelings around knives and cars and when I’m alone (like right now, everyone else is asleep) I keep thinking how easy it would be to just do it. Pick a poison and do it. I don’t want to put my living family through that kind of pain but I am worthless to them as it is. I can’t connect with them because all I do is cry and sit on my phone reading about stillbirth since it happened. All the ways I caused it. I’m not taking care of them or myself and I have no desire to start. I’m totally checked out. It’s like I’m already dead. I’m a worthless mother and they’d be better off once they got through the grief. My husband could find someone else who meets his needs better and my living child might even forget me someday. If I wait much longer that won’t be true.

I’m in therapy and lots of support groups but they’re just bandaids for a problem that can’t be fixed. My baby is gone and it’s my fault. Nothing can bring her back so I just don’t see the point in living anymore. That’s the long and short of it. I don’t think I’m an immediate suicide risk but I think about it more and more, and sometimes knowing it’s an option makes me feel better.",wowifkkedup,5,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jyss7h/i_dont_want_to_be_here_without_my_baby/,second child wa stillborn full term last month want live anymore love husband first child much pain living without second much feel like murderer baby supposed born supposed easy take care baby pregnant go thing could caused could prevented wa nothing wrong baby ha felt le movement go hospital make excuse matter fault deserve live baby dead killed baby baby deserve die happened maybe coward wanting live guilt painful plan far hit slap one see hear bruise enough keep getting weird feeling around knife car alone like right everyone else asleep keep thinking easy would pick poison want put living family kind pain worthless connect cry sit phone reading stillbirth since happened way caused taking care desire start totally checked like already dead worthless mother better got grief husband could find someone else meet need better living child might even forget someday wait much longer true therapy lot support group bandaids problem fixed baby gone fault nothing bring back see point living anymore long short think immediate suicide risk think sometimes knowing option make feel better,want without baby,wow kke dup,2114,39,wow kke dup second child wa stillborn full term last month want live anymore love husband first child much pain living without second much feel like murderer baby supposed born supposed easy take care baby pregnant go thing could caused could prevented wa nothing wrong baby ha felt le movement go hospital make excuse matter fault deserve live baby dead killed baby baby deserve die happened maybe coward wanting live guilt painful plan far hit slap one see hear bruise enough keep getting weird feeling around knife car alone like right everyone else asleep keep thinking easy would pick poison want put living family kind pain worthless connect cry sit phone reading stillbirth since happened way caused taking care desire start totally checked like already dead worthless mother better got grief husband could find someone else meet need better living child might even forget someday wait much longer true therapy lot support group bandaids problem fixed baby gone fault nothing bring back see point living anymore long short think immediate suicide risk think sometimes knowing option make feel better want without baby
Im so exhausted and I know I don't have long,"I don't even know what to say anymore. Not sure if I want an answer or if I just want to vent.

I have always been somewhat depressed my whole life. I was never super popular with anyone and even now I'm still just the punching bag with all my friends. I've been pretty good about controlling my emotions but these last two months have been hell. Most of my recent problems are in my past post history so I'm not going to repeat it.

My ex-girlfriend transitioned to a guy about a month and a half ago and everything I ever cared about just went to shit. I tried to be as supportive as I could but nothing ever seemed to be enough. It took me about a week or two to start using the new name and pronouns which from what I've heard is pretty good for me to adjust that quickly but it just didn't matter. My ex has blocked me on everything we were connected on and I'm starting to believe our entire relationship was a lie.

I was called so many fucking things and told I was such a piece of shit for being the way I was but I have texts saved and video evidence of him doing the exact same bullshit. I know in the end he's just a lying asshole but all I want is closure.

I attempted suicide about a 3 weeks ago and I ended up surviving but I was in a behavioral health center for almost the whole week. I've gone to therapy 2 times a week since I was admitted and it hasn't done anything. Im rereading this whole post right now and its barely even cohesive. I feel like a psycho just scribbling in a notebook at this point but I don't care. I'm thinking about making an exit bag in a day or two and making sure I don't recover this time.

I want to die first. Why do we have to exist? Why are we conscious? To just feel this pain?

I don't want to see the end of my life all alone without my mother or anyone else i love. In the youngest of all my siblings.

I feel like shit,"I had suicidal thoughts from time to time for a while, but in the last few weeks its become way more often.

I dont know why, but I kept saying 'oh, just a few more days and Ill start', and now I have to hand it in tomorrow without having much and I feel like shit. I dont know why I couldnt bring myself to write, why Im so fucking lazy, I read that this kind of un-motivation to do anything can be a symptom of depression, but then I feel like I am just looking for cop outs. And I dont think there have been days in the past few weeks where I havent thought about just ending it all, except maybe if I was too drunk to care. On some days I am pretty sure I want to end it, and on some Im pretty sure I dont want to. On the one hand I feel like I have a lot I would still like to do, but then I dont see how I will even reach a time when I can do what I want. And of course there is my family, probably the biggest reason that kept me here.
I just know that when I fuck this bachelor up and thus wasted the last four years it will be a massive disappointment not just for my family (who I btw lied to about my progress on the thesis, so Ill have to explain this to them too), but for me too.

How to end my life painlessly?,"Realistically i only have suicide as an option long term, i have a couple thousand pills in my house but would rather not suffer more then i need to, being alive is painful enough.

My go-to choice for killing myself is jumping in front of a train at speed, that does of course drag someone else into it who's life may be traumatised as a result, if push comes to shove then so be it because i can't go on but i'd rather not hurt even more people with my existence if i don't need to.

I can get most types of prescription medications from various pharmacies so i need advice on what i can overdose on or what combination of things i need that will just knock me unconscious and  keep me like that long enough for me to stop breathing or stop my heart or something before i regain consciousness again.

Edit:

I have no interest in continuing to live, I've done everything i can to avoid it, spoken to about every helpline and person i can and it's not helped, this is in my best interests at this point.

Edit:

I have tried to get hold of carbon monoxide a number of times but finding someone who will sell it to me is always an issue, i don't own a car so can't go down that route to get it.

Or, does it even matter which I choose? Either way I see the holidays being all but permanently ruined for my family in the future, and I would like y’all’s advice.

I need to decide today if I should kill myself,"This is kind of long, but I’d appreciate if you read this through. My reason is religion. I’m a Jehovah’s Witness, and before you tell me “get out of the cult” I’m here to say I’m just too weak. I have nothing and no one outside of my family and I lose them if I abandon my religion. The strict guidelines and everything else aren’t my issue. It’s the fact that I’ve been raised to believe people who don’t learn and practice this religion don’t get to keep living, and it sticks with me no matter what I do. I don’t want to believe that all my friends are going to die but I can’t wipe it from my brain, and if I tried clearing my head by distancing myself from everyone I’d lose my family, my only tangible reason for wanting to live in the first place. Regardless of what I do I just feel so empty, life feels fake and I feel trapped, the only thing that really brings freedom is death, and I fully intend to kill myself. I think my best friend irl who’s in the same religion would completely understand if I offed myself even if my family would be devastated which is comforting in a way. The only other person I care about enough to want to stick around is this girl I met online a little while ago. She’s gotta be the most amazing person I’ve met and talking to her legitimately makes me want to live just so I can get a chance to chat more with her. The problem is, the thoughts don’t go away. I’m terrified what I’ve been taught is right, that even she will die when the time comes. I’m also terrified of leaving her behind because I truly adore her and want nothing more than to spend another second making stupid jokes and goofing off.

I'm overdrafted by hundreds of dollars, in many tens of thousands of debt, and I just bought the last few meals I could afford out of my change jar.  I don't even like what I'm doing- it's a waste of my life and I hate it...and even then I'm still not good enough to even be doing it.

I don't enjoy anything anymore and I just feel like every moment I'm awake I'm suffering- alone- only able to wallow in the abyss of my misery, self mutilating until I can calm down enough to sleep through another greater portion of a day.

Never thought I'd be posting here but the thought keeps coming up and it's freaking me out.,"On the outside people (typically) see me as charismatic, positive, upbeat, and the type that looks at life bring full of silver linings. On the inside I struggle with maintaining genuine connections and friends. 

There's a quote I heard that's pretty fitting, I'm friendly with all but friends with few. 

My best friend, one of my only friends actually, started seeing someone new and it created some space between us. Jealous of that time shared with someone else I acted out and now there's a rift that seems too large to bridge. It's like they just picked up with someone else and that's it, I'm hurt and feel so alone.

I've noticed myself imagining the unthinkable to mitigate the constant pain. I'm afraid that I'll let myself get into a bad headspace and actually go through with it if I keep allowing those thoughts to pass unchecked. 

I see it playing out very vividly and feel a brief relief, then start to think about my brother who I know it would be incredibly hard on. If it wasn't for him I don't even know what I'd do or where I'd be right now.  

If something ever happened to him what the fuck is stopping me then, I wonder.

I've been thinking about getting a dog. A big slobbering loving dog that wags it's tail when I come home and jumps in my lap to be close if I sit down.

I don't feel close with anyone anymore, and it's starting to hit hard. I don't feel an innate sense of purpose and my life feels unfulfilled. I want a family but loathe the idea of ""searching"" for a life partner, and it's hard to dive into other things like work or new projects when a family is what I want the most. Everything else seems like a waste of time. I want to be needed for me as a human, not what I can provide or purchase with my skills or the fortune that's been bestowed upon me. 

Such first world problems I know. I'm fortunate to be able to go to the beach pretty much any day I'd like, travel places most only dream about, and purchase things that are ridiculously expensive. 

None of that shit matters to me and I'll always secretly wonder if people genuinely like me for me or if they just like me for what I bring to the table in terms of materialistic pleasures and/or financial security. 

Just feeling really jaded about life and the connections we make with others. I've got one friend who I know will be there for me no matter what, extravant lifestyle or that of a pouper doesn't matter. Is it selfish to say I need more than just one friend who I can trust like that? 

If I get a dog I figure that'll give me a good 10+ years to sort out these fucked up thoughts I've been having. 

Pretty sure I'm just rambling at this point but I guess that's better than going through with the thoughts and images that gave been playing in my head the past few weeks.

This is my story of what i’ve went through,"this is long so buckle up

I’ve made a few posts on this sub venting and such but i have stayed off it recently and thought it was time to go back to tell my tale so here it is

On October 27th i attempted suicide. I took 30 Percocet and attempted to OD. I texted some friends in a group chat and basically told them what i was doing and saying sorry and all that. One of them told their moms and their mom told mine. the worst part of it was my moms face when i told her what i did. so she called 911 and i got in an ambulance to the ER. When i got there i basically found out all the percs were expired so nothing happened. I woke up and they had me go to a separate building so the psych ward or mental hospital. It was your basic psych ward. i had a cool roommate. most of my day was spent playing cards and such. it was the teen place so it was pretty fun to hang out and talk with other kids your age about your experience and what happened. I’m 16 for reference. After that was over i got prescribed anti depressants specifically prozac. then i started the PHP program for teens as well. this was the same thing with support groups but you don’t sleep there. this was actually a lot more boring at it’s mainly just lessons. but it wasn’t all bad since i got my dick sucked in the bathroom. the girls there are wild lemme tell you. but that’s that and now i’m out of that and starting to go back to normal. still depressed but suicidal thoughts have gone away for now. but i’ve started cutting so that’s not good i guess.

I'm thinking of ending it,"I hate myself. I'm turning 21 in 3 months and I've still never kissed a girl. I've been on 2 dates, including prom. I hate myself. I barely have any friends, I'm failing out of school. I can't find an in person therapist because of coronavirus, and online therapy is about as good for your health as driving a nail through your skull then bashing your head against a steel wall. I've never dated anyone, never been kissed, up until very recently I was a lifelong bedwetter. I fucking hate myself. And therapists can't even help. They all keep saying ""you're a late bloomer. It isn't weird to have never kissed anyone at your age. Nobody will think less of you"", but I think that's retarded. Because I've had multiple friends hook up with the opposite sex, and find out they were that person's first kiss and it grossed them out. And I was made fun of when I was 15 for never having kissed a girl, imagine how ill be treated at 21.

Nobody fucking loves me. I can barely talk to my Mom about this or anything else I'm going through, because every time I mention I'm depressed, her immediate response is that I should be medicated or hospitalized, but she doesn't realize that will make my life so much worse (who wants to date a depressed nuthouse cooc?) 

I will never be happy, because even when/if I do kiss a girl, have sex, date, or even get married, ill always have to live with the fact that I wasted years of my life, and never did anything in highschool or gradeschool, and wasted college as well.


There is no solution here but suicide.

But I'm too afraid to kill myself. I have no quick ways to do it, and no painless ways to do it.

I feel like I'm already in hell. Like I've died and just can't remember it, and this is my hell.

Struggles,I’ve struggled with suicidal tendencies ever since my brother killed himself when I was 12. My life was completely changed. I’m not sure where I would be if he was still alive. In college I had heavy alcohol abuse and drug problems and I kicked it pretty recently afterwards but now it’s creeping up again. One night I lost it and committed myself to hospital for a week. My drinking sometimes gets the better of me and I think about suicide. But the one thing that tethers me to this shitty fucked up world is my family because I need to help them and I basically pay all my sisters bills and stuff for her 5 kids. But some days I just want to end it all. I don’t know if that’s selfish or me being my true self. Prozac doesn’t help. Talking doesn’t help. Some days I feel it creeping up on me. Most days I’m tired of helping but I can’t help but say yes to everyone la request no matter what it is. Even if it means not eating for days. I’m in the line of work where I have to take care of 20+ people but how can I take care of them when I can barely take care of myself. I’m just not sure what to do anymore.,rzorosantoryu,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jyr587/struggles/,struggled suicidal tendency ever since brother killed wa 12 life wa completely changed sure would wa still alive college heavy alcohol abuse drug problem kicked pretty recently afterwards creeping one night lost committed hospital week drinking sometimes get better think suicide one thing tether shitty fucked world family need help basically pay sister bill stuff 5 kid day want end know selfish true self prozac help talking help day feel creeping day tired helping help say yes everyone la request matter even mean eating day line work take care 20 people take care barely take care sure anymore,struggle,r zoro santo ryu,1111,9,r zoro santo ryu struggled suicidal tendency ever since brother killed wa 12 life wa completely changed sure would wa still alive college heavy alcohol abuse drug problem kicked pretty recently afterwards creeping one night lost committed hospital week drinking sometimes get better think suicide one thing tether shitty fucked world family need help basically pay sister bill stuff 5 kid day want end know selfish true self prozac help talking help day feel creeping day tired helping help say yes everyone la request matter even mean eating day line work take care 20 people take care barely take care sure anymore struggle

I'm short and depressed.,"First time posting here, but this is something that I have been struggling with for a long time and I want to get it off my chest (at least a little).

Some backstory: I'm an Asian male, 160cm tall and in my late teens. I was born premature and have been struggling with health concerns through most of my life, however none of the pain from surgeries or parental pressure ever bothered me, compared to my height. My height is the one, vivid defining factor that dictated my relationships, school life, confidence, etc. 

Ever since my peers started outgrowing me, the casual ridicule from people (good people, who often don't even know how much their words or jokes hurt) about my height slowly whittled away at my confidence and self esteem. I have always been social and outgoing, and play numerous sports, but those all too often are placed on the back-seat as compared to my height. It seems like no matter what I do, nothing can ever traverse the chasm between my height and that of my peers, and the sheer lack of respect people have for me due to my height has resulted in me slowly becoming more and more depressed over time. Relationships have been few and far between, and I am ashamed to say the experiences I've had as well as the countless comments from women (often casually) about my height has resulted in me having a low opinion of them in general, and thus affecting my empathy for them. Nowadays, I only look for hookups and casual sex, the thought that I could never be enough for someone due to my height being so deeply ingrained in me I've stopped thinking of having any emotional connection to women.

Nowadays, I go out, socialize, party etc but inside, no matter how many friends I make, how f**ed up I get at parties, how much fun I have, I can't stop feeling hollow inside, and angry that I couldn't at least be born average height, even just a little taller. 

The worst part of it all is the fact that I was even lucky enough to be born with good features, and just had to get the short end of the stick (literally) with my height. 
So many times I've heard comments like ""He's kinda hot, but his height..."" or ""I'd smash if he was taller."" I've even considered limb lengthening surgery but that's really the only driving force I have right now, the prospect of one day being regarded as a real human being compared to the midget I am right now being absolutely amazing. 

I use various drugs to numb myself to my feelings, but those brief flashes of happiness soon fade in the light of reality - that nothing I do will ever really help, even limb lengthening will only make me slightly taller at best. I wear insoles to increase my height, and with my height being so short, they help me be regarded as an equal at least by girls, and even guys. I can't be taken seriously or as a male by a lot of my fair weather friends, and honestly have been considering just ending it all sooner or later rather than struggle through life being mocked and disregarded for something I couldn't control.

I don't know why I'm writing this. Maybe its a cry for help, maybe I'm just frustrated and this is me venting. If I try too hard at stuff and be competitive I'm ""compensating for something"", if I get into a relationship oftentimes girls' girlfriends, etc will give them peer pressure to stop dating me after realizing my height, and ridicule me constantly behind my back. The amount of times something good was broken apart due to this is crazy - an example being how one of my closest friends, someone I thought I could connect with during my highschool years completely ghosted me and cut off contact due to her friends making fun of me and her for talking to me. This hurt especially because I had been there for her when she was going through a lot previously, and wasn't even trying to get into a relationship, but the sheer fact that me, a short guy, could ever be worth talking to seemed to fly over most of her friends' heads. This incident in particular is what caused a lot of my current self destructive behaviour, not caring about university, just going out and getting f**ed up every night to feel alive, hooking up with prostitutes and talking to them, finding them better friends than most of the 'normal' women I know, too.

TLDR: short guy wants to kill himself. cue the ""haha manlet"" ""help the gene pool"" etc

"Crohns, Lumbar Scoliosis, No Friends, Extremely Broken Family (more than you could imagine), drug addict father, and much more. I’m losing hope each day.","I feel like a bitch for crying about my life when people are out there continuing to live their life even when it’s worse.

I have Crohns Disease which causes me more pain than you could imagine, it wastes more time than anything, and causes me to look more skinny than sticks on a tree. 

I have Lumbar Scoliosis which I’m assuming is from Crohns.

I have no friends at all. Not one.

My family sits in their rooms all day and they all hate each other, my mother who has been the only parent in our lives for years constantly screams each day which I’m assuming is due to being Bipolar.

My father is a drug addict and hits me up every few weeks trying to get inside my brain as he has been extremely manipulative his entire life.

I am beyond poor and scared for my future.

I genuinely want to end my life, ive told my brother who is closest to me many times I just don’t care to live anymore. I feel like my entire life I’ve got shit on each day and it only gets worse as the days go on.

I just got home from another attempt,"I tried to kill myself in August. All I did was crash my boyfriend's car, get a DUI, am now forced into sobriety off anyting even nicotine for the state diversion program I'm in. I rolled the car and the airbags didn't go off so I have a carotid neck injury and will need CT scans every 6 months for a few years. I'm now a stroke risk during covid. I also am on the brink of being diagnosed with cervical cancer I got from HPV from a rape over a decade ago and have been monitoring since.

My family was incredibly abusive. My sisters use to beat and spit on me. My brother choked me unconscious and threw frying oil on me. He also stole acid once from my dad's chemistry lab and sprayed it on me and those are just a few greatest hits.

My partner is a complete douche bag and porn addict. I hate him so much sometimes. Because I'm sober, as is he, for the first time in years everything is harder. Does he care? Fuck no. I interrupted a stupid fucking story about how he hates going out (no shit we do nothing together) in the car Thursday because we got home and I wanted to pet a sweet cat that comes by the house. I asked 4 times if I could get out and he just kept talking so I apparently blurted out ""stop talking so I can get out...you're going to scare the cat away"". Cue 2 straight days of the silent treatment because ""he was so taken aback by ""stop talking"". So ""rude and disrespectful"".

Thing is, this man could not be bothered to look up from his phone or console when you're speaking. I have PTSD and have repeats of the things my family did to me often. The other day I was talking about how I wasn't doing ok that day because my mom had been texting me even though we're not talking, brought up the acid story and he NEVER looked up from his phone. When I told him he should chill about the ""stop talking"" if I can manage him not bothering to look up or say a goddamn word when I'm talking about my traumas and he goes ""I'm sorry but how many times are you going to tell that story"".

He just got a talking to at work by HR because of the way he talks to women. He sees nothing he does as wrong. I have no way out of this relationship and have no family worth contacting for help.

Tonight I just started walking towards farmland and was going to either stuff my pockets with rocks and try the creek or if that wasn't deep enough then at least I'd be soaked and hypothermia would set in quick as it was around freezing.

Why I don’t ask for help,"So I’m not as suicidal as I used to but I used to have this boyfriend who helped me with my thoughts and feelings and everything, anyways he always told me that if I talked to my parents about my suicidal thoughts that they would get me the help that I need, and I always dismissed him by saying that I was scared of them seeing a different side of me. But tbh my biggest fear is that they won’t take me seriously, I already know what’s gonna happen when I tell my parents I’m suicidal, my mom will just go on and on about how I have everything in life (like food, love, shelter, etc) so I can’t be depressed or unhappy. My dad will probably blame it on today’s generation or my phone or just being lazy or something dumb like that. And then at the end they will just say to look for God and I will find the answer. I have nothing against religion, I believe in God and I’m catholic, but when my abuser lectures me about God it really angers me, like if they were following the “word of the Lord”.
My parents aren’t horrible people, I love my mom and well with my dad it’s more complicated but he worked hard to get out family out of a shit hole of a country so I guess he isn’t terrible.

She told me for years that she didn't want to be a wife or mother. She told me she needed to work on herself so I gave her the space she asked for. She told me when I confronted her that I wasn't their for her. I've been drinking heavily for the past few months hoping I can just stop the pain. She's staying at a friend's house because I want this to work. But when we try to reconnect we see each other for a few moments and then she makes an excuse why we can't hang out longer.

I Want to Die,"I feel unstable all the time. I can't get on medications because the side effects make me feel terrible and I can't miss work or be doped out. I keep annoying the people who are there for me because I can't get my head together.

I'm tired of everything. I keep waking up thinking I might do it today. Some days have more intent. I worry so much about hurting my family and my husband, but it isn't about them. My mind makes me believe that everyone around me is disgusted of me and that I keep messing up and people will always be disappointed. I never feel comfortable anywhere and I feel disgusted of myself and the person that I am. I don't feel like a person people want to have around.

I'm a broken man. I give up. I've been fighting for far too long. I don't want to fight any more.,"I will attempt to be quick, clear, and concise.

I'm a 35M, married, had two kids, one boy one girl. My son would be 11 today and my daughter would turn 4 in February. 

I've battled heroin addiction and alcoholism since I was 19. I've had periods of sobriety- 3 years clean twice.  Months countless other times. I haven't drank in 4 years. I'm not especially proud of that because it was one of the easiest things I've ever done - stopping drinking - I didn't miss it, didn't give two shits about alcohol. 

I've ruined lives. My parents are amazing people. They've dedicated their golden years to seeing me go in and out of rehab, I went to prison once, I'm just awful. They never stopped rooting for me.

My wife. God she's a saint. Before she met me the worst thing she did was smoke a cigarette. She received a BS in Elementary Education. She taught special education. I made her try heroin. I'm the worst. She resisted for so long. She still lived for so long. I made her try heroin. Heroin didn't let go.

My mom is a retired teacher. My father is a CFO. He is a CPA. I've been riding his coattails for years. Perhaps he enabled me. That doesn't matter now. He's 74 and still working. He will probably never retire. It's my fault. I'm the worst. I've cost that man 200k by my calculations. Its probably far higher. He will never leave me. I wish he would.

My sister is/was a heroin addict. She's been clean for a decade. She won't talk to me. My family is fractured because of me. I have three nieces and a nephew.  They still love me but they probably shouldn't.  My sister still won't talk to me. She's probably the smartest out of them all. Dump me early. Stand your ground.

I need love. Now more than ever. I finally have a better grasp on my addiction than I ever have. It doesn't matter. Its too late. I've ruined everything good I've ever had. I have nothing. I want to die. I've made my peace with life.

I burnt all my bridges. Cant find a heroin dealer that will sell to me. Totally meant to do that but I figured my life would get better. Wish I could still cross those bridges. 

Cant drive my car into a wall or a semi or something else that will kill me. At this point, this immaculate 10k car is the only thing I could leave my family. I have no assets and no life insurance. Heroin saw to that. 

I'm a felon so I cant own a gun. 

Hanging seems awful. 

I'm not going to drown myself.

Im miserable. I have been for a long time. I think about death constantly. I've come to terms with it finally. I'm ready.

I feel like I'm approaching the breaking point.,"My mind has been very foggy recently. Negative thoughts began flooding my head a few weeks ago and lately it's been more and more difficult to keep them out. I've pushed so many people away, I've started feeling like I've started wasting everything around me just to feel a fleeting sense of joy that I can't even feel. Everything sucks.

Nothing makes me happy anymore. I feel like a prisoner in my own mind that I can't escape and it's honestly getting hard to cope with it. The moment I try to recall a happy memory, three more immediately replace it, stuff that traumatized me in the past.

Social anxiety has ruined my life and after my first semester in college I’ve finally accepted that I have no hope at a fulfilling life.,"I have no social skills, I can’t initiate conversations I can’t maintain or make friendships I struggle to find things to say when I’m alone with another person. Growing up I was always the smart and quiet one, and now I’m just the weird, isolated, soon to be burnout one. All my closest friends from high school, most of which I became friends with in grade school or were introduced to by my grade school friends all went to college together while I decided to go to a college that has a better computer science program. This past semester I have had a couple opportunities to make new friends and I did t take them because I didn’t know what to do. My whole life I have never been the one to initiate hanging out even if I wanted to. I either never let any of my personality out or I’m just fucking obnoxious and insufferable. I realize that my future is one of loneliness, never finding friends or a life partner. I crave social interaction. I want to hang out with people, make new friends, go to parties and just have the overall “college experience”, or at least have one with a couple friends in it. I have only enjoyed three days this semester and those were when i visited my friends at their college. It alleviated my (irrational) fear that they would replace me, but made me realize that they are living the life I can only dream of. Those 3 days I felt like a real person. I want to interact with people but I don’t know how, I don’t know how to make conversation or small talk or just talk to friends. Even if I got rid of the social anxiety magically I still don’t have the social skills or habits to make and maintain friends. This is why I realized I have no hope. I thought that I just need therapy or medication to get rid of the anxiety (haven’t tried but I know it’s pointless bc of the aforementioned lack of social skills), but it’s all just fucking hopeless. The depression has seriously affected my college grades. I graduated as a valedictorian, 36 ACT, many APs credits and classes. I just can’t do schoolwork right now, but I can’t stop because then the feeling that my life is so quickly passing by me will intensify even more, which will just worsen the situation. There’s no fucking point to living. The only reason I am alive is because elf the naive hope that I have always had that things will get better if I do xyz or by random chance (things have never gotten better), and because I can’t bear the pain I would cause to my loved ones. My future is a bleak one without anything to bring me happiness, only cos rant pain and fucking suffering as everyone around me gets to experience everything I crave but know I never will.",willguy116,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jys6wk/social_anxiety_has_ruined_my_life_and_after_my/,social skill initiate conversation maintain make friendship struggle find thing say alone another person growing wa always smart quiet one weird isolated soon burnout one closest friend high school became friend grade school introduced grade school friend went college together decided go college ha better computer science program past semester couple opportunity make new friend take know whole life never one initiate hanging even wanted either never let personality fucking obnoxious insufferable realize future one loneliness never finding friend life partner crave social interaction want hang people make new friend go party overall college experience least one couple friend enjoyed three day semester visited friend college alleviated irrational fear would replace made realize living life dream 3 day felt like real person want interact people know know make conversation small talk talk friend even got rid social anxiety magically still social skill habit make maintain friend realized hope thought need therapy medication get rid anxiety tried know pointless bc aforementioned lack social skill fucking hopeless depression ha seriously affected college grade graduated valedictorian 36 act many aps credit class schoolwork right stop feeling life quickly passing intensify even worsen situation fucking point living reason alive elf naive hope always thing get better xyz random chance thing never gotten better bear pain would cause loved one future bleak one without anything bring happiness co rant pain fucking suffering everyone around get experience everything crave know never,social anxiety ha ruined life first semester college finally accepted hope fulfilling life,guy 116,2660,136,guy 116 social skill initiate conversation maintain make friendship struggle find thing say alone another person growing wa always smart quiet one weird isolated soon burnout one closest friend high school became friend grade school introduced grade school friend went college together decided go college ha better computer science program past semester couple opportunity make new friend take know whole life never one initiate hanging even wanted either never let personality fucking obnoxious insufferable realize future one loneliness never finding friend life partner crave social interaction want hang people make new friend go party overall college experience least one couple friend enjoyed three day semester visited friend college alleviated irrational fear would replace made realize living life dream 3 day felt like real person want interact people know know make conversation small talk talk friend even got rid social anxiety magically still social skill habit make maintain friend realized hope thought need therapy medication get rid anxiety tried know pointless bc aforementioned lack social skill fucking hopeless depression ha seriously affected college grade graduated valedictorian 36 act many aps credit class schoolwork right stop feeling life quickly passing intensify even worsen situation fucking point living reason alive elf naive hope always thing get better xyz random chance thing never gotten better bear pain would cause loved one future bleak one without anything bring happiness co rant pain fucking suffering everyone around get experience everything crave know never social anxiety ha ruined life first semester college finally accepted hope fulfilling life

Alone,"I’m seeing constant posts about mental health, everyone sharing all over Instagram all over Facebook Snapchat, everything you can think of. But the same people preaching all that are the ones who know I’ve tried to kill myself, who know I’m never happy within my life and still do nothing to try and help, still never reach out and truly ask if I’m okay. 
Everyone is so fast to blame it on coronavirus, it’s just dismissed as ‘lockdown blues’ or something stupid like that. Yes, of course the virus has affected people, but dismissing peoples feelings will just make it worse. I’ve been depressed for 3 years, been thinking about what it would be like to commit suicide for that long, and yet all the therapists I’ve talked to, all the people I’ve talked to always say ‘yeah I guess COVID doesn’t help’. It’s not fucking covid, it’s everything, don’t dismiss my feelings because you feel too uncomfortable to deal with them so you’d rather convince yourself it’s not true. 
If I die, then people will start caring. They’ll all say ‘I wish I was there for (him/her). Yet, now, when they have the chance to be there for me, they’re not. One single phone call, one text message telling me to smile or telling me I’m in any way valued is all it takes, yet they won’t even think about doing that.
Everyone has their own problems. But stopping someone killing them selves is surely the most important thing. 
I don’t understand why I’m so alone in this. I’ve always tried to hard to be there for other people, I’ve talked to someone in a similar position to me and helped them out of it, and now that person is ignoring me back completely. I have to be polite to everyone and fake everything because they will leave me otherwise. I’ve always tried to hard to be there for others, but now I wonder what’s the point.
The only thing stopping me from ending my life is the guilt. Guilt is keeping me alive, guilt for what everyone would feel afterwards - the same people who have tried their hardest to not help.
I’m not alive for myself anymore, I don’t want to live. 
Everybody really needs to check on their friends more, and better. Don’t just check up on people to convince yourself you’re a good person, because that’s clearly what people are doing with me. I’m sure some people will feel the same as me, but I don’t have anyone else to tell other than this Reddit.

My partner wants to kill herself.,"2020 has been one awful year in our household. Setback after setback, endlessly working with no savings to show for it, and the loss of loved ones. My girlfriend and I are typically happy, but this past year has rotted much of our relationship. I don't have much of a spine, so I typically cry, shut down, or resort to being a doormat when it's been a bad day. My gf however has a temper, she yells, screams, swears to the point my neighbours have approached me about it, and when she can't possibly rage anymore she breaks down into having sobbing and suicidal ideation. This makes support difficult because all the yelling has a way of making me clam up and my heart to feel sore, and it all reminds me too well of my childhood home growing up. While my dad never hit me, he had a volume which would bring me to tears, and my reaction to my partner's anger is much the same. I myself struggle with depression and spent a stay in an MH ward last year for a suicide attempt, so naturally my support for her usually includes what I found helped me, mainly professional help, having someone to talk to who was detached from the situation, medication, and for her specifically, working on her temper issues.

All of this she rejects. She refuses medication, she distrusts mental health professionals, and makes empty promises about dealing with her anger. I'm worried because she has a family history of suicide that she's at great risk of following through if the day is bad enough. Her reasons mostly come from low self esteem about her appearance, unemployment, or the feeling of getting nowhere. She's my best friend and I love her and I just want to see her happy, but I'm all alone in helping and I'm pathetic help. I want her to get help because I'm scared if my efforts aren't good enough, I could lose her. She doesn't have anything in the way of a professional diagnosis, but her mood swings between crying and angered screaming at the slightest frustrations make me think there might be something she's been ignoring for a long time.

I just want to curl into a ball and die.

late nite poem tings,"Restless, I'm taking a step

Writing down everything all for prep

For my GP to say ""Try therapy""

A wave hits me of familiarity

&amp;#x200B;

I just wanted something different

Maybe a diagnosis or something significant

But it goes down the same old route

All options become moot

&amp;#x200B;

As much I desire the pill to become unsaddened

They make it so hard to navigate to become gladdened

It's filled with trip wires and windey paths

And I get caught in my own wraths

&amp;#x200B;

I look for help, trying to figure out if there's something more

But I'm torn between the possibilities, it's gnawing my inner core

Of knowing whether it's normal and safe

between the suicidal ideals, the self-harm and the collar around my neck, beginning to chafe

&amp;#x200B;

the leash is held by the insanity, also myself

and I feel like i want someone to hold my hand

but i don't want to drag anyone's health

when it comes to addressing my mind, to understand

that i'm ultimately broken, a burden, and wasting everyone's time

i think i should die

I appreciate you caring, Alex. Because you care, I need to make something clear to you...Please, be aware that your good intentions can cause harm. 

I was made aware that you went on Evie's live show and said something to her about me killing myself? I NEVER said that I would kill myself. Please remember that I'm a real person. Just because YOU MISUNDERSTAND what I'm saying, doesn't mean you can choose to use your free will to confuse others. 

Please, be careful what you say. I am not suicidal. I did NOT say I would kill myself during my stream. If you cannot understand my sarcasm, please check with me first. I speak with LOTS of sarcasm. If you want literal responses, you should ask for them. 

You can cause serious harm by misunderstanding my words and worrying my friends, or others. 

Again, I know you DONT mean to misunderstand, but it's very harmful for you to quote me saying things I NEVER SAID in any literal sense.

You're an adult and I will treat you as one. So, please take this message as me defending my rights to be able to speak for myself. You do not speak for me or my mental health. Ever.  Leave my friends alone. 

Brittany

I’m a patron of hers and if you don’t know who she is as a Youtuber and she’s had a history of attempts and near-attempts. What she said is that if Biden installs a mask mandate she’d do it (nonvoting hardcore constitutionalist). As someone who has worked for a crises clinic, I am of the belief that you should always reach out to friends when someone is suicidal even if you don’t know them personally and sometimes she says she’s being sarcastic when she’s not.

I'm tired,"I'm tired of my life as it is.
 
I'm tired of who I became in order to survive.I'm tired of being treated like shit by my narcissistic mother. I'm tired of not being believed and understood ,I'm tired of not being loved and the first option. 

I don't see a way out ,I'm fed up of my mother destroying any sense of independence/individualism I have. 

I'm tired of not being able to meet any sort of expectations I have of myself (getting a job,doing better in college,dating... and what's worse I'm in my 20s,I'm a fucking adult)

 I'm tired of being me

I'm tired of being depressed and not having energy for anything. I'm tired of feeling like I'm in a constant rollercoaster ,of feeling the fear of gravity but never being ready to feel the pain of the fall
I'm tired of being scared in my own house ,of my own mother. 

I'm tired of walking barefoot on broken crystals,I'm tired of being lonely but I can't stop isolating myself either.

Fiction used to work to make me feel better but not anymore;everything is dark and gritty and I know first hand this world is cruel and ruthless;I carry those scars pn my skin: I don't need a reminder.

I'm tired of hiding who I am,because I want to preserve a little of peace, I want to escape judgement for a little bit.

I'm tired of not being able to have dreams because my parents made sure to destriy every single one of them and left me empty

But what truly makes me burn with anger is that all of these people who have hurted me are living better lives than me ,while I'm just slowly being consumed by this vitriolic poison that is my own self destruction.

So I wrote a 6 pages long godbye letter and that not even everything,"I have a hard time explaining what I think and mean and all that stuff. People always say ""Oh its okay. We will understand you."" But no they dont. And I dont only mean the bad shit. I literally cant explain a thing. Its just too hard. Its like a disorder but not diagnosed or something like that. At the same time I have so much to say I just cant deliver properly. I dont have a lot that keeps me from just ending it all. I just dont do it. But today was a bad day and I thought about it so much again. You have to know I am also bad at doing anything. It takes so much brain to write a text which I simply dont have. Okay I have the brain but like I am really bad at it. Could be ad(h)d but I never got tested and its really hard to get tested but yeh. So FINALLY. After a million years i took this task uplon me to write a goodbye letter. THE goodbye letter. This was the very one thing I wanted to get finished before I go. I dont want anyone to think they knew me when they in fact didnt even had the chance to, since I cant explain shit to myself. In there are a bunch of situations, people, theories, social media and secrets that I just wanted to share after I die. I even gave it a headline ""The unfinished life of me"" Nothing sick but yeah. I basically just talk to myself in that letter and tell the second me about everything. That makes it a lot more easier. So I think i finally got over one big hill and now I am exhausted. Its already 6 German Din A4 pages with little no no pragraph breaks or how you call these. I didnt even gave a damn about my grammar so a lot of it is just written in lower letters and with shorts like idk, lol, af and so on. The font size is on 11 and I am consistently writing in arial without italic or bolt. Holy f why is this so much?! How did I even do this. I did more than in the last 10 years in school yeay. I decided to take a break here and continue when I am breaking down again. We will see how long it will take and what I will say and or do when I am at the end.

3/10 cant recommend.

But I guess I will just continue to not kill myself.

I don't know why I'm still here,"I'm tired of all of this, and I'm trapped in a life that I can't escape. I don't want to destroy my family by killing myself, ruining their lives is the worst thing I could ever do, so I'm just here to endure this on my own and waiting patiently to die. I've been depressive since my 14 and I'm now 20M. I've always had OCD and it kind of made me think in different ways as any other person my age. I feel like I didn't even live to this point, I can't remember have any good memories of being a kid, nor a teen. On top of that I've always struggled with the way I looked + other things that I really couldn't accept to live with. I was born with real elf ears like on the top they are super pointy and one of them is just hypertrophied and looking insanely big compared to the other. This caused me some issues with other kids when as I was an easy target. Until this point I still had some faith and hope in the future, maybe puberty could make me good. But it turned out to be completely the opposite, and when I realised that I started to fall deep into depression and never left it since. So now I'm just a joke, I never liked who I was but now it's just unbearable. On top of that, I have a really odd shaped head, flat on the sides with two bumps on the top, a vertical line going from my ear to the top of my head on my right side looking like it was a scar. So, to top that a half of my face is just flat, from my cheek bone to my foreheard, which has a huge bump on it. I'm balding like crazy i don't even have hair until the top of my ears. The less important thing would be the pyramid I have as a nose. You would have understand that I don't really like myself. As if it wasn't enough, my body decided to grow up in a weird way, my feet and my hands still are the same as when i was 15/16, thin and short as hell. And to finish it all i wouldn't even have the possibility to have children as I may be sterile. I don't like what I do in my everyday life and I want to die.

relapse ✌️,"I (22/f) came up to Virginia (from tennessee) to stay with my sister (33) and get my life together (job, glasses, drivers license etc) it started out fine but we were both getting stressed out by each other (her dogs and children are very loud and jumpy and I just don’t vibe with that, I tried to tolerate it, though.)
She was so two faced and would say everything’s fine and I’m great to have around and then when she has a bad day she explodes on me and tells me how awful I am and I don’t know what it means to be exhausted (I started a new job two weeks ago, very labor intensive so I’m covered in bruises. My joints lock up and I can’t move after I rest, when I do, it’s incredibly painful.)
I’ve always kept my suicidal thoughts mostly to myself (especially with my family.)
but I finally had enough and decided to take action. I can’t win. I don’t do anything and I’m a disappointment, i take baby steps to get to here I need to be but it’s not good enough. It’s exhausting.
I self harmed after being clean for three months, I went to a bar to feel better but ultimately I decided I should drink to the point to where I’m defenseless, so whatever happens to me, happens.
I got really, really drunk. I started crying.
an older man (looked to be about 70) entered the bar and sat with me, trying to comfort me, but then he started holding my hands, and sat beside me, and pet my hair, and kissed my head, and told me to take my mask off, when I refused, he kissed my hand. He kept asking me if he was attractive. He got up to get me another drink (after I declined) I got up to use the bathroom and while I was at it I told the bartender not to let me leave with him, that he was making me uncomfortable. After he left, I cried because that had just happened. another stranger walks up to me and tried to comfort me. Much less creepy, much more sincere. He was with friends who were trying to sober up. He hugged me and let me cry on him.
After he left I went outside to wait on a friend to pick me up but I thought they bailed because it was getting late, my phone had died hours earlier.
Wandered around for several hours and managed to charge my phone. My sister going off about how awful I am. The feeling wasn’t going away. I thought about lying on train tracks. A stranger tried to get me to get into his car. He refused to tell me his name while saying stuff like “come on, girl. Hop in” I had to really think about it because I was still wobbly and drunk. I couldn’t do it. I told him no thanks and he drove off.
(Over text) After my family expressing how upset they are because of me, I blew up. It was going to happen eventually, I was just hoping it wouldn’t.
I was finally telling my mom that I’m not okay. She told me to “go to the damn hospital”.
my sister texting her that I’m doing it for attention and that she’s going to throw all my shit away.
everyone’s trying to convince me that she cares about me but the way she’s going about it is really fucking with my head.
I admitted myself to the hospital where I’m hoping I can get the treatment I need.
everyone thinks I’m crazy or a fake and it’s the last fucking thing I need right now is more judgment. It’s only been about eight hours since I’ve been in here. Everyone’s been really nice so far. I’m still convinced I shouldn’t exist but maybe this go round I can actually be fixed. 

TLDR;
family make me feel bad time to kill self. getting treatment tho.

Life feels like a chore to me at this point.,"I just need to fucking vent out about this because clearly besides my parents and grandma nobody gives a fuck about me. 

I feel as if my own brothers could give two shits about me. Whenever I joke about suicide, they just say I'm looking for attention and then go on to constantly remind me that  I have no friends. I can go days or weeks without a text or snapchat. The only time someone ever texts me is for a group project for school or something else about my job. Nobody without a forced relationship has stayed in my life for more than a few weeks, maybe a month or two if I'm lucky. What makes it all worse is that someone from my town just committed suicided last week so now everyone is acting like they care by saying ""you're not alone"" on social media. If they care why has nobody seen me struggling and showing almost every major warning sign?

I've never really thought about suicide this much until the last few weeks, maybe two months. But at this point I don't see anything to look forward to in life. If I've been alone my entire life, what do I have to believe it will get any better.

I Feel Like God Is Telling Me To Kill Myself,"A couple of months ago I started contemplating suicide because of a certain issue. During that time, certain things happened and it almost feels as if God is trying to tell me to kill myself.

I was once on the Youtube homepage, and I clicked on a song suggestion. The song was ' West End Girls ' by the Pet Shop Boys. The first line of that song is '' Sometimes you're better off dead, if there's a gun in your house aim it at your head ''. I immediately closed the song.

I'm not sure if this happened on the same day, but it happened close to that time. I was again on Youtube, and I saw a thumbnail for a song suggestion. "" God was never on your side '' by Motorhead.

Despite being a Motorhead fan, I had never heard that song before. The reason why this title struck me so hard was because earlier this year, something happened which caused me to believe that the exact opposite was in place. That God was on my side because something positive had happened and I was feeling very thankful. But that positive thing turned negative a few months ago, which is what caused me to become suicidal. And I feel like this song suggestion was like a '' Haha gotcha loser '' message from God.

I have gotten a few other moments like that. Where I've seen things which eerily remind me of my situation. And what I've seen has always involved the element of death. I feel like God is laughing at me up there and is turning my life into a joke.

Just recently, I've been struggling with the idea that no matter what I try in my life, it always ends up in failure. Then this evening I was listening to an old Joe Rogan episode where he was talking about some credit card thief who went to a casino to gamble and Joe's exact words were '' This guy was a perpetual loser. He just couldn't win! '' And then his guest made a joke about how he should have jumped off a bridge. 

That's the exact same thought I was dealing with that day. The fact that no matter what I try, I always fail.

I'm not even that religious. I'm agnostic but I've always leaned towards the idea that there might be some universal power out there.

But what I'm experiencing right now has got me convinced.",LightThrowAway10,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jyqod8/i_feel_like_god_is_telling_me_to_kill_myself/,couple month ago started contemplating suicide certain issue time certain thing happened almost feel god trying tell kill wa youtube homepage clicked song suggestion song wa west end girl pet shop boy first line song sometimes better dead gun house aim head immediately closed song sure happened day happened close time wa youtube saw thumbnail song suggestion god wa never side motorhead despite motorhead fan never heard song reason title struck hard wa earlier year something happened caused believe exact opposite wa place god wa side something positive happened wa feeling thankful positive thing turned negative month ago caused become suicidal feel like song suggestion wa like haha gotcha loser message god gotten moment like seen thing eerily remind situation seen ha always involved element death feel like god laughing turning life joke recently struggling idea matter try life always end failure evening wa listening old joe rogan episode wa talking credit card thief went casino gamble joe exact word guy wa perpetual loser win guest made joke jumped bridge exact thought wa dealing day fact matter try always fail even religious agnostic always leaned towards idea might universal power experiencing right ha got convinced,feel like god telling kill,light throwaway 10,2168,44,light throwaway 10 couple month ago started contemplating suicide certain issue time certain thing happened almost feel god trying tell kill wa youtube homepage clicked song suggestion song wa west end girl pet shop boy first line song sometimes better dead gun house aim head immediately closed song sure happened day happened close time wa youtube saw thumbnail song suggestion god wa never side motorhead despite motorhead fan never heard song reason title struck hard wa earlier year something happened caused believe exact opposite wa place god wa side something positive happened wa feeling thankful positive thing turned negative month ago caused become suicidal feel like song suggestion wa like haha gotcha loser message god gotten moment like seen thing eerily remind situation seen ha always involved element death feel like god laughing turning life joke recently struggling idea matter try life always end failure evening wa listening old joe rogan episode wa talking credit card thief went casino gamble joe exact word guy wa perpetual loser win guest made joke jumped bridge exact thought wa dealing day fact matter try always fail even religious agnostic always leaned towards idea might universal power experiencing right ha got convinced feel like god telling kill

Suicidal again. Should I tell someone?," Initially posted this on r/selfharm. Thought it better fit here.

Hello, everyone.

My mental health has been rapidly declining over the past week.

I relapsed on Sunday after 1 1/2 years of being clean. Since then everything became so numb again.

When I found my suicide note from June there was no emotion connected to it. I don't feel anymore.

The only time I feel genuinely happy is when I talk to a certain friend. He is the only one that knows about my sh and I feel like I don't need to hide around him.

But I know that he means much more to me than I do to him. He is always so helpful while I'm just kinda there.

He knows that I was suicidal in June but I told him that I was fine now. Which was a lie. I have been suicidal since Tuesday. Still am.

The thing is, I don't want to die.

But I know that I can't stop it by myself.

The reasonable thing would be to ask my friend for help. But I don't want to be manipulative or bother him. I don't even know if he considers me a friend. He has some mental issues himself and I am scared of making it worse for him. I also don't know how he could even help me. I already am in therapy and going to a mental hospital is no option right now.

Should I tell him? If so, how? And what could he even do to help me?",breathinghumanperson,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jyf4e5/suicidal_again_should_i_tell_someone/,initially posted r selfharm thought better fit hello everyone mental health ha rapidly declining past week relapsed sunday 1 1 2 year clean since everything became numb found suicide note june wa emotion connected feel anymore time feel genuinely happy talk certain friend one know sh feel like need hide around know mean much always helpful kinda know wa suicidal june told wa fine wa lie suicidal since tuesday still thing want die know stop reasonable thing would ask friend help want manipulative bother even know considers friend ha mental issue scared making worse also know could even help already therapy going mental hospital option right tell could even help,suicidal tell someone,breathing human person,1270,38,breathing human person initially posted r selfharm thought better fit hello everyone mental health ha rapidly declining past week relapsed sunday 1 1 2 year clean since everything became numb found suicide note june wa emotion connected feel anymore time feel genuinely happy talk certain friend one know sh feel like need hide around know mean much always helpful kinda know wa suicidal june told wa fine wa lie suicidal since tuesday still thing want die know stop reasonable thing would ask friend help want manipulative bother even know considers friend ha mental issue scared making worse also know could even help already therapy going mental hospital option right tell could even help suicidal tell someone

Thanks for reading.,"I don’t know where to start. I’m 22 years old and have been feeling an inevitable doom over my shoulders for some time now. When I was 17 I literally woke up one morning and didn’t feel right. Not as in a depressive episode or a panic attack, but as if I was still dreaming. A light foggy feeling in my head. I was depressed at the time due to isolating myself from others and not attempting to have a social life, but it’s been nothing compared to what it has been lately. As time went on the foggy feeling only got worse. I thought to myself “its only temporary, by the time your 20 it will be long gone” but I’m 22 now and it’s more present than ever.

I have a 1 year old daughter and a beautiful girlfriend. I have a decent car and a house to live in. Everything that I need I can provide for myself. I don’t know why I feel how I do. I try so hard to hide how I feel from my girlfriend and daughter, but I feel I need to let her know sometime soon. I’ve tried getting help but when it comes to it I can’t help but hide how I really feel. I have convinced myself that if I let anybody know exactly what’s going on I will be hospitalized. I have to much on my plate for me to not be able to work and be with my family right now. My brother is currently in jail involving the death of his infant son last September. His wife was pregnant when he got arrested and after she gave birth I was contacted by the department of human services and asked if my girlfriend and I would be able to care for their newborn daughter. We immediately said yes.

My little sister has been in and out of foster homes for a couple years. Last year I finally had myself together enough to be able to take her into my custody. I learned shortly after she moved in with us that she was pregnant. She gave birth a week after my brothers baby was born.

I now have a daughter of my own, my girlfriend, my niece and nephew, and my little sister that I have to be able to provide for. So I feel taking a break for my mental health is off the table right now. To them I try to make it seem like nothing is going on. But I’m reality I’m barley hanging on. To them I appear normal and healthy.

I feel incredibly isolated and trapped inside my own head. I’ve been feeling paranoid lately as well and it’s the worse thing that I’ve been through. The thought of suicide has been becoming more and more casual for me to think about. I never want to kill myself and I never thought I would, but I’m feeling so disconnected from reality I fear it’s the only way out. I dont think I would be able to, but with how I’m feeling recently I become more unsure every day. I work a third shift job Monday through Saturday so Sunday nights I’m all alone. When I get off work I spend an hour or two with my family and then tell them I’m tired and need to go to bed, but I can’t sleep. I lay awake in bed and toss and turn for hours until I finally fall asleep, leaving me with 4-5 hours of sleep before work. I try to sleep with my girlfriend on Sunday nights but I can never sleep for more than an hour. I’ve been having terrible nightmares every Sunday. I wake up feeling dreadful and scared, I don’t know why. I go into the living room and try to watch tv and clean the house, but that does little to help how I’m feeling. I’m scared that one day on a Monday morning my family will wake up and find me dead in the basement, without ever knowing why. I think about how it would affect my family, and the depression, guilt, and anger it would bring them, and it’s enough to stop me. I fear one day I won’t be able to stop my self from wanting to end my suffering. My life in the past 3 years has been nothing but mentally terrifying.

"27m alcoholic, obese, failure, sexually confused","I'm 27 years old, have been gaining weight rapidly over the past few years and jerk off to trans porn almost 4 times per day for the past 6 years. The worst part is, I picture myself in the trans person's perspective.

I can't cope with this anymore. My family is Muslim and this thought horrifies me. I'm fully attracted to women, but sometimes picture myself having sex with a man in the woman's place. 

I'm trapped in this constant stress. I smoke, I drink. I isolate myself even though I'm an extremely social person. I eat my troubles away and have put on 80 lbs in just 6 years.

Idk what to do. Idk if I even want to change, but I've been spinning my wheels for years, trying to fix my diet, feel better, took pills, etc.

suicide isn't Wrong or we just don't care. its proven by how we treat it,"suicide isn't Wrong or we just don't care. its proven by how we treat it  
suicide prevention isn't about care. its about money and a pat on the back. always has been and always will be.

we use guilt and others feelings to say why its wrong. which actually proves the person is right NOT wrong. if you can't think of one reason it would help them you likely are wrong in saying they shouldnt and also likely wrong they are truly helping others. (if they can't help themself they can't help others we actually teach this {can't fill from empty cup} )  


next we make false promises. it gets better. no statistically it gets worse not better #sorrynotsorry it was a mis-informed program for bulling in schools and it actually failed even for that. stop spreading it.  
we make other promises but don't personally verify or have anyway to make sure they have a reasonable chance of being true. STOP DOING THIS! you prove their suicide was right. and that you lied. last thing you need when you need them to trust you. #don'tmakeapromiseyoucantkeep  


stop making it a actual CRIME to attempt suicide. great proof there its not about helping but money. YES look it up is is a crime in the books or used to be. but the successful completion is not.  


AND MOST IMPORTANTLY if they say its FINANCIAL related the ABSOLUTE WORSE THING YOU CAN DO is to GIVE them ANOTHER BILL... that means the WORST POSSIBLE thing is to call the cops on them.  
you an't cute. you aint doing the right thing. your teaching them A: you don't care about legal or financial issues for them. B: that prob makes them more suicidal and more likely to attempt.  
C: its a dick move and proof the healthcare system and mental isnt about saving lives BUT making money.  


remember its NOT asked for by the person, non consent treatment. PROVEN to not be medically necessary in majority of cases and actually more likely to cause harm. WHY THE F$&amp;$&amp;&amp;$ should i have to pay one dime for it. oh yeah because its a LEGAL thing not even a medical and untill after the asseement its more less practicing medicine without a license. (the cop isnt trained for this; many require a medical doctor to interact, but most don't actually do this)  


you want to save someone form suicide DON""T EVER CALL 911 on them. you 100% of the time do not improve the situation this has been proven. you can't stop them from doing it. and you WILL 100% of the time lose a friend for it. and make them for up to 3 months MORE likely to actually die then before.    


\^\^\^ needs to be teached rather than the outdated lie.  if you really want to help BE there in person. otherwise you can't help by a phone call to police. which for some groups that alone can make sure you can find out the person died instead. some like LGBT and POC actually that alone is the most likely to end up with them dead by the police.   


better yet if you don't even know if they are at work or home DON""T FRI\*ING CALL. i was pulled out of work and lost pay and socked with a 2.5K medical bill you don't think i was less. i actually attempted AFTER that when i had no intent before.

I'll do anything if it means I get to die,"My while life I've been bottling up my emotions away from my family because I wouldn't like to see them upset and not understand what I'm going through. My siblings don't help the pain and sometimes only make it worse. They make fun of my coping mechanisms and say tons of things that are offensive to me but won't shut up about it being just a joke. It pisses me off. Everytime I try to open my mouth to say something I get interuptted or sidetracked and I'm not able to speak anymore because what's the point of trying to talk to someone if they probably won't listen. 

I have fucked up thoughts and think of killing someone or myself and it makes me feel things that I've never really felt before. Sometimes when I hear someone whine I just wanna rip their skin apart so I don't have to hear them anymore. I'm really addicted to pornography including fucked up shit like guro, and I feel so ashamed of myself because I became the person my old self would've hated.

I sometimes wish murder was legal to just increase my chances to die. It always feels weird to take my headphones off and realize that I'm surrounded by darkness and the sound of silence. It makes me hopeful that one day I'll get to live like this forever. I don't want conversations, a love life, a job, anything.

I know the world still has beauty, that there are still so many dreams left unfulfilled and small pleasures left to find. 

Still, I grasp at methods. It is as comforting as it is disturbing to go over the minutiae of how I would leave this world - everything from knots I would need to know and the weight requirements of the rope, to what time of day would be best to avoid any possible intervention.

I don’t love or care about anything enough anymore to want to keep living. Not my family my dreams my hopes. Nothing feels enough....
And I kind of want to just ask the love of my life to leave me and move on. The only thing I want is for him to hold me one more time, to see me off, in a sense. So that when I leave I can leave in the arms of the one person who could have meant the world to me. If only I wanted to live enough.

I am in college and doing well. But at the end of it, I feel like it’s pointless. Everything with COVID has ruined everything I ever found comfort in. I have a very rocky relationship with my mom, all of the things that have happened this year has seemed to make all of it worse. To say the least I have mommy issues. I see a therapist, but I am afraid to say I’m feeling this way. I don’t want to be in the hospital, I cannot afford a stay in the hospital. I’m also in finals week of college, which I just wanted to prove to myself for once that I could actually do it. But again. I don’t even feel like it’s worth it anymore. 
I also have severe health anxiety and so everything happening this year is even furthering this problem. 
I don’t want to hurt anyone. I just don’t want to deal with any of it anymore. COVID has truly ruined life for me.

I’m never going to be at peace with wage-slaving.,"I’m only 23 years old. And I’m finding that I don’t fit into this modern society whatsoever. Based on how life has gone so far for me, I have two options:

1. Work another 40+ years 
2. Commit suicide 

**Things working against me in this society**

- I don’t have the entrepreneurial spirit or the passion to want to run my own business. 

- I lag behind in the “soft skills” that are required for most office jobs.

- I do not want to do physically demanding labor.


**Things working for me in this society**

- I have no college debt and have a BS in Communication.

"I really want to do it, but I know there’s another way","2 years ago I finished first year university, I had a girlfriend of almost 2 years, just made the dean’s list at my university, and was on the best workout routine I’ve ever been in and was a jacked as I’ve been so far. Then that September hit, I’ve smoked cannabis every day except for 3 days since then. Usually in the evening before bed, but at some points 3-4 times a day. My motivation deteriorated and so did my mental health. Kept taking it out on my girlfriend unfairly justifying I didn’t have enough time for everything. My marks have slowly gone down but 2nd year I still made it on the deans list. Last year I was starting my classes for my designated major accounting... and this is where my mental health started slumping into more depression than just being depressed sometimes. I hate the work now, it feels tedious and not something I can do forever. I’m in my 4th year and barely passing classes, I’ll be lucky to get a job after I graduate. Just dropped a class due to being some damn far behind and my graduation will be delayed another semester. Not to mention my girlfriend dumped be a week before quarantine started in March. Continues to say I was emotionally abusive, I know I was, I’ll take that blame, but she wasn’t perfect either. These days I cant get out of bed before noon, and spend half my day watching TV and surfing the internet, the other half panic studying. I don’t know what to do, this isn’t what I expected adulthood to be. I thought I’d find a fulfilling job that allowed me to be creative or work in athletics (was a multi sport athlete at the highest levels in my city during high school). But here I am, in June I would’ve graduated 4 years ago, I weigh less than I did in high school weighing 155 pounds at 6’2”, used to weigh 190 with 8% body fat after 1st year university. Other than kill myself, what should I do? I need some advice because I hate the way I’m living my life with no self discipline being lazy as shit.

I feel perfectly sane, but I want to push myself closer to the edge of despair, so is that sanity? 

I have just been sent off on a depressive spiral by not getting a job that would improve my life by a huge amount and I've spent the weekend in bed crying, deleting social messaging apps, staying in my room, and actively not wanting to eat or drink.

I know that doesnt help but it feels comforting in my head to do this??? Like maybe I can drive myself towards suicide?

Maybe I'm comforted that it wont last forever anyway, ill eventually eat, download the apps, leave my room, as well, but i just want to punish myself maybe?

A petty reason to die but I've had enough,"I think I found the right place to pour out all my messages before I attempt to commit suicide.

I'm going to become homeless soon because my extended family who is my provider is forcing me to move back to my mom because all I am was a burden to them. And they have all the right to do so because I don't do any chores, I always wake up late for school, and overall lazy. I have no excuses to make for being lazy and not doing helping with the chores. It's also not enough reason to not do all chores and task because day by day I feel like shit for waking up. I don't have any motivation to do anything at all. I'm only studying and alive for the sole reason that as a human being I have to do so. 

My extended family doesn't care if I commit suicide as long as I don't do it in their house. I would rather kill myself literally before I go back to my mom. She had caused me a lot of pain and trauma that I don't want to get back into.

"18F/I can't take the stress at home anymore. Help, please.","I'm in my first year of university and it's tougher than I expected: I have a hard time learning by teaching myself and this online learning with almost non existent professors has made it worse. 

To my mother, any online schooling is no actual schooling meaning I don't get my allotted time each day to do my school work (watching lectures, doing assignments, tests, etc.). My classes are asynchronous and that's the only thing saving half my grades. Every day I need to help around the house for hours and I can't tell her I have work due or a lecture to watch. She doesn't care. Anything I say to her results in me being scolded and all my past mistakes being brought up and me being told how I'm a shitty child who can't even help around the house.

I don't get time to myself until later at night, maybe 10pm. At this time, I'm worn out and can barely find it in me to do my schoolwork. With the pandemic, I can't go to a library or anywhere to focus on my work. I don't know what to do. I have so many assignments due this month and I haven't gotten anywhere. The stress is piling and I honestly don't see  the purpose of continuing my education because I don't care what my future looks like anymore. I don't see the purpose to hope for any good to happen anytime soon.

I experienced the feeling of meaningless for the first time in my life,"I lurk this subreddit a lot because it honestly astounds me how I don’t know what it feels like to be depressed, suicidal, unhinged and the like.

However for the first time this week I experienced this feeling. I won’t go in depth, but a relapse of a certain drug caused me to feel like I was... not belonging in this world. I looked back at all the absurd messages I sent to friends (and strangers) and I only feel guilt and shame. Eventually I’ll start feeling better by as time goes by but even with friends around me, everytime I wake up the cycle of emptiness resets. This is my 4th day in this cycle.

While I’m a little more stable now, I can finally admit that I understand what a lot of you are going through right now. Some of you might have it way worse than me. All I want to say is try to stay strong. Find a goal to reach, and don’t make it impossible. Once you achieve that goal extend it little by little.

Feeling really down,"It’s 2020 and I’m really struggling. I love being in a relationship and being without a significant other at the holidays is killing me.

The man I loved til the end of the earth turned into an Abusive alcoholic and broke up with me suddenly at the beginning of August. I couldn’t get out of bed much for two months. I wish I could reach out to him. He kind of reached out last month to me to return my stuff but I never replied or said thank you. I would give my right leg to spend holidays with him. My counselor said not to reply to him and ignore him. He is a narcissist and untreated diagnosed bipolar. I have developed heavy drinking from being with him.

I made myself start dating again in October and met a guy who is smart and funny but he has some real dealbreakers. And I’m not sure if he’s into me that much. He texts a lot and is communicative but as soon as we had sex he backed off slightly.

I am wondering if it’s because I have a mom tummy and I need to lose about 20 lbs. all I can think is once I get into bed men are horrified and want someone with a tight tummy.

Poem about being in the hospital,"Thrown into the world of psychiatry 

No turning back now im a fucking zombie 

Zap my head till my face turns red 

Electric shock until all anger is dead

Now I'm in a land of sunshine and milk

Skin is dry and flakey but in my mind its smoothe as silk

Sunshine shines through windows and creates pretty spots on the ceramic floor

Young nurse comes up ""here have some more!""

I am grateful and comply

With a tilt back of my head and big gulp

But not a twinkle in my eye

My soul is dead but I sit in this ward without a care in my head 

I watch the birdies through the window 

I watch the wind blow through the trees

It wiggles around all of the pretty green leaves
 
This is exactly where I want to be 

Because these people care about me",schizo_rambo,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jybyc9/poem_about_being_in_the_hospital/,thrown world psychiatry turning back im fucking zombie zap head till face turn red electric shock anger dead land sunshine milk skin dry flakey mind smoothe silk sunshine shine window creates pretty spot ceramic floor young nurse come grateful comply tilt back head big gulp twinkle eye soul dead sit ward without care head watch birdie window watch wind blow tree wiggle around pretty green leaf exactly want people care,poem hospital,chi zo rambo,748,32,chi zo rambo thrown world psychiatry turning back im fucking zombie zap head till face turn red electric shock anger dead land sunshine milk skin dry flakey mind smoothe silk sunshine shine window creates pretty spot ceramic floor young nurse come grateful comply tilt back head big gulp twinkle eye soul dead sit ward without care head watch birdie window watch wind blow tree wiggle around pretty green leaf exactly want people care poem hospital

He thought that i deserve to suffer because i am stupid and i can't let go of my misery...not like i want to keep it or sth...fuck life is shit. I didn't want him to have my view...i just wanted someone that could listen to me when im in really bad mood....guess i was wrong.

I write this here because there is literally noone that i can vent to...last time i gave a hint to my mother she told me that i am spoiled child...like why people can't just listen and be silent (not say something incredibly infuriating to me because they didn't understand anything from what i said).

I want to postpone my studies but my father refused.(costs him money, why spend on your kid when you can buy 10k watches?!)  he blamed me for my performance. He's right tho. I started sleeping less during thw night, more during the day. Play games so i can forget who i am. Stay in my room as long as i could. What do my parents say about this? They tell me im lazy, stupid, a mess, a failure. Compared me to my siblings, to their friends childrens. 

I burst into tears every time i locked my doors before ""sleep"". I don't want to wake up and get out of bed. I play games to forget my pain. I don't think i deserve anything. I guess my dad is right, i am a failure. I always think that somewhere down the road, i might kill myself. It saddens me even more that i have this thoughts. I don't want to die like that.

I don't buy in to these reasons to live,"People are telling me the same things again and again. ""You have a family and they need you."" Type stuff. I was laid off from my job in August and after well over 100 applications, career coach, professionally made resume, no gaps in work history till now, 13 years with the same company, and referrals to certain positions I'm still hopeless. I'm contributing nothing to my family. I provide nothing financially and emotionally I'm angry and not supportive. I see my wife walk around on eggshells and now my daughter because they don't want to upset me. 

I'm an alcoholic on and off. No legal troubles or abuse. This has made my wife want to send me off to rehab for as long as it takes. I have distanced myself from my friends because we would all drink and I can't be around that. 

Other things, mom died in August of last year, Grandma who was basically my mom died in September,  dad was diagnosed with cancer two weeks after that, a few weeks later he was diagnosed with another cancer, I mentioned being laid off, I caught my wife talking to another guy, and most recently I totaled my car. So a lot has happened in the last year. 

I'm done with it. I'm tired of waiting for the next bad thing to happen and to just be a drain on my family financially and emotionally. 

The other day I slit my left wrist but it wasn't deep enough. I hear hanging yourself is the way to go. I have written most of my suicide letter so I think that's about it.

I'm lost,"In my life, I've attempted suicide about 5 times and I've never regretted any attempt once. I remember one time, I woke up in the hospital and the first words I heard were (translated in English) ""Wake up so mother only has to pay -amount-

The thought of suicide crosses my mind every once in a while. I realized my trigger is being unheard (I'm not sure how to translate the word in English).

I dropped out of college after being diagnosed with depression because I couldn't focus, I can't keep a job more than 6 months, and during this pandemic it's getting harder to find a job.

I feel so useless to my family and I don't even think they're trying to understand me. I feel so unheard. No one listens and no one cares. I feel like a tool - unappreciated even after all my help.

I feel betrayed by one of my best friends and now I feel like my only outlet is gone,"This is going to sound so fucking stupid. My fucking methods of coping are fucking stupid. I'm sorry if this sounds fucking whiny or privileged. 

I've always been extremely depressed and suicidal. In recent years, I joined Discord and met a bunch of wonderful friends on a particular community. I've been very attached to this community, and the owner, while initially bad at running it, has slowly been getting better than better, and the community has been improving more and more as a result. In a way, that community that I use as my escape constantly getting better and better over time felt almost motivating. My escape is improving, it's even more enjoyable to use it, maybe I can get through this?

There's a particular member in the community that used to frequent it. They're a terrible person. They completely destroy the place for me. It's no longer somewhere I can hang out in and feel relaxed, but somewhere where i feel constantly stressed by their toxic presence. I hate them so much.

About half a year ago, they were permanently banned. This was part of the 'community constantly improving' that I talked about earlier. The ban was well recieved, and the community felt so much nicer to use. My escape really felt like a comforting place where I could hide from the pains of the real world. It was comforting. I relied on it.

Today, the owner unbanned them. I feel so betrayed. We're very close friends. I can't believe she would do something like this. Something I had become dependent on has been ripped away from me. I feel like I have nothing, no outlet, nothing to save myself anymore. 

And I feel even worse about feeling this way in the first place. It's just her doing what she thinks is right, it's not like she was trying to hurt me. I understand that. I feel selfish. I feel like I'm using my hatred for a person as an excuse. I don't know anymore.

A message to the future/past/present,"A lot of people think of suicide, for some people they would just love to be gone but when it comes down to it, they are scared to end it.

I also had this issue when it came to the most lethal ways of ending everything, yes I've tried before but I survived with no long term damage, no one knows I've tried

I feel I finally got past the fear of pulling the trigger or whatever it is to end my life, I don't want to be here anymore and I may not be for much longer. There are still things that I want to do before it happens and ill make sure to do them. There's only one thing/person that could change this they will not be named.

I lost my soulmate and now I'm more depressed than I have ever been,"Recently, I lost someone very important to me, someone I met on Discord, a Polish girl that I became very close with for three weeks, for those three weeks, I was very happy, I was very interested in her, and she was very interested in me, every morning, she'd send me a message asking how I was, we'd talk about anything that were on hour minds, sorrows, innermost thoughts, and our dreams and goals, we were very attentive towards each other, she had a COVID situation at home and I was constantly asking if she's feeling any symptoms, fearing that I may lose her, once I drove to the beach because she said she wanted pictures, and I drove 40 minutes to the beach just so I can take some pictures to send to her, we'd send each other voice messages sometimes, when words couldn't describe what we want to express, also I often share pictures of my meals with her, all in all, because I felt as if I found my soulmate, someone I felt valued by, someone very close to me, and I was no longer lonely, I was no longer suicidal.

But if you're reading this, you're probably wondering why I'm writing, well, good things never last, because I suffer from a wide range of mental issues, specifically trust issues, and fear of abandonment, my senses became heightened to the peak when it comes to detecting anything that can perceived as a sign of she starting to dislike me or distrusting me or leaving me, two days ago, she said she wanted to share her Instagram with me, we have already sent a lot of pics of ourselves to each other by then, but then she sort of withdrew the idea, I felt that our bond and trust we had for each other is threatened, and I started to feel distant to her, the next day, she was replying very late to my messages and I felt worrisome, later, she sent a screenshot where she was having a conversation with someone where she sent several voice messages, saying that she feels sorry for her friend that they have to listen to her rants, again, I felt that like I was being replaced and I couldn't even admit to her how I feel, because I know I'm being pathetic, and irrational.

Unfortunately, that night, we argued, and fought about pointless things, time and time again I insinuated my fear that we're not close anymore, at the end of it, she said to me ""If you don't want to talk to me anymore, tell me and I'll never message you again"", as I saw that statement, I was hurt, I wondered if our past three weeks meant anything to her, for her to say something like this, that wasn't what I wanted at all, I felt that my trust issues was real, and my fear of abandonment demanded that I must push her away from before she has a chance to leave me, and as such, on an impulse, I said to her ""Don't ever message me again"", even though deep now, I know I didn't meant it, and then I unfriended her. That night, I couldn't sleep, I was suffering from harshest depression I had in years for hours, in the morning, I couldn't eat, I was still thinking about her, I was wondering if I have gone too far, I was wondering if she's crying, I was wondering if this friendship can be fixed.

After talking with few friends about my situation, they recommended that I reconcile, I knew I had to talk to her again, and I will attempt to put things right. When I added her again, she didn't accept it, which prompted me to add her twice, only then she accepted, I wrote about how I was sorry and I was hurt, and I wished that we can work on this, because I still value her, unfortunately, she was cold, and distant, she didn't really want to talk to me, and she insinuated that our relationship was toxic, and if we continue it, then we'll just argue again, I knew by then that, I was no longer anything of worth in her eyes, the damage is done, and we're now what I feared the most in the beginning, that we'd become apart. So I said to her ""You're heartless, is our past three weeks all a joke to you?"", for she replied ""WTF, I'm heartless, right, it was all a joke, right, I was staying up all night every night as a joke, I was checking in on you every day as a joke, I trusted you to tell you about my personal life as a joke, I tried to motivate you and make you feel happy as a joke, I even though once, that you're the type of person I could possibly fall in love with, nah sorry, it was a joke too"".

I couldn't even comprehend it, I didn't even read it word by word, I was simply hurt and I just wanted her to tell me that I'm still worthy, so I asked her ""Am I still important to you"", she said after that I called her heartless, no, I'm not. By then, I entered a defeatist mindset, I believed there's nothing else I could do, so I said goodbye to her, before she unfriended me, she left a message that I think I'll always remember, ""If it wasn't for your fucking trust issues, all of this wouldn't have happened"", as I read this, I realised, perhaps she's right, my trust issues ruined a lot of relationships, I was unable to commit to her, I was always doubting myself, I always feared that she may leave me one day. And the thing is, it happened, it happened because I believed it, not because I fear it. So my advice for everyone out there, wish for what you want, don't fear for what you don't want. Never say anything hurtful, if you're hurt, if you're angry, tell the person you value ""I really care about you and it's upsetting that we fight like this, I just want to let you know, I care a lot about our relationship and it's not where I'd like it to be and I'd like to make it better so can we talk about it?""

I can't handle this shit any longer.,"I can't take it anymore. I'm so fucking done with everything. I can't ever do anything right. All I do is bring people down and make them feel like shit.

About 5 or 6 months back, I found out that my girlfriend had started cutting herself, a couple months later, she's diagnosed with bipolar I disorder. I've been trying to support her for the entirety of the time that I've known about it, and it's slowly building up and draining me. I've had two suicide attempts, both complete failures.

Lately she's seemed distant, and I feel like she doesn't love or care about me anymore, and that her friends are more important to her than I am, even though we've planned out our future together, and even named our children. School has been slowly overburdening me, as it's genuinely gotten to the point where I feel like I'm drowning in assignments, and I can't do anything about it due to the severe lack of motivation my unbearable depression has caused me. My parents are both very disappointed in me, and think that I'm just a huge waste of time. I can't get out of bed every morning, and when I do, I wish I had a gun to shoot myself with, without a second thought. The only reason I'm still alive is out of fear that my girlfriend would do something to herself she can't undo. I stay up and get little to no sleep every night trying to both support her and try and get my projects done and submitted in time. I just wanna be relieved of my stress, I can't do this anymore. I hate myself so so much.

My birthday's coming up soon, and I can't even go out with my friends to celebrate it due to the substantial amount of missing assignments from my bitch teacher who deliberately doesn't want to comprehend that we have our own lives, problems, and mental struggles.

Reasons I want to Die. Any Reasons to Stay Alive?,"1. I struggle financially. It's really hard for me even to pay my bills, or eat properly. I just make somewhere like $2-10 / day. I used to have business, but it's all collapsed. I have tried to start all over again, but I keep failing.
2. Because of what happened last year, and this year, I now have social anxiety and severely depressed. I am dysfunctional, and even buying grocery outside takes lots of effort
3. I have no friend nor family. technically I have family but they don't care about me, well maybe if I die, they will care. not sure though. I cannot complain about this actually, but I am actually a burden. So I am all alone.
4. My health becomes like shit, and I cannot even afford to go to hospital. It's getting worse each day. Don't talk about insurance or something, I cannot even afford to pay it. Well I am just barely able to afford my $2 simple food every day.
5. My long term GF left me 1.5 years a go, well that's because I have been useless, and dysfunctional.

My Story,"I'm really struggling with killing myself right now.  Just got out of jail for domestic violence, I won't get into the details.  Basically it boils down to, I have been struggling with alcoholism due to PTSD (mil vet), anxiety and depression for the last 10 years, and my wife encouraged me to try her anti-depressant to try and help me.  So I started using it, but it's definitely just an element to my problem, not really the root or biggest deal.  For the entire time I was with my wife, I had a habit of going manic, depressive, but not usually suicidal.  Once in a while I would express it, but reason verbally that my kids keep me going.  


3 months into this drug, citalopram, and one of my manic episodes turned into a very serious attempt at suicide.  There was a family trigger with my father, my wife got scared and called the cops.  Then I was into full panic.  I have a few pending custody issues going on that I know a domestic violence charge would completely obfuscate my position, and I instantly ran for my gun safe to try and kill myself to make what I considered at the time the best possible outcome for my wife to keep my daughter in her custody rather than my daughter going to my ex's family (their family is on record for sexually molesting her as an infant, but CPS cares more about the very provable alcoholism that I had at the time and had no interest in protecting my daughter from her predatory, might I say evil, family...luckily the law was on my side in the end and after much fighting/legal fees)  


Anyway, I am in no way excusing my behavior, just trying to understand it.  My wife perceives me trying to take the phone away from her while she was calling the cops to stop me from being suicidal as assault, which she has every right to and I'm in no way trying to downplay.  Actually, that's the primary reason for my self-loathing.  


I absolutely love my wife.  I adore everything about her, I can't even think of 3 flaws she has off the top of my head.  In fact, the only thing I can think of is her patience and understanding.  Her compassion, her love, how hard she tried to help me get through my problems.  And now, 3 months into citalopram at her advice, I have finally put hands on another person, despite my absolute pacifistic core values.  I can neither understand how I acted that way, nor forgive myself for it.  My family and friends, with great reason, have chosen to excommunicate me to stand with her.  I would give them that same advice if they asked me what to do.  Nothing gives me more solace in knowing that her of all people is the person that will guide my children to adulthood.  


With all the circumstances that I face, if I was to try my best and power through this, I'm looking at 5-20 years in prison, and out of respect for my wife I will not fight any of it.  However, I am a very strong willed person, and I do not want to spend 20 years in a cage and watch my kids grow up through letters in the mail.  My wife finally drew a line in the sand, and I agree with her.  My kids do not need me around them growing up, even if I think I have some philosophical value to add to their rearing, and even my wife would probably agree that I'm a genius when it comes to non-physical discipline and education for them...but I will never forgive myself for forcefully trying to snatch the phone out of my wife's hand, and now that the law is involved, I'm afraid any optimism going forward is just hot air.  

I feel like if I was to remove myself from the picture now, before they get too old, would be best for them and me.  I'm an affliction to everything and everyone I've ever loved, and I've gone against my core principles and beliefs in a way that I can't understand.  


I want someone to explain to me how living the next 5-20 years in prison is better for my kids and ex wife, than just committing suicide.  I know I can financially provide for my family, I have a business etc, but my wife does as well and she does not need me for anything like that.  I think she's also decided that she doesn't want me around the kids outside of her whim.  At the same time, I need someone to do that, because my wife clearly doesn't want me to kill myself, and I'm sure my kids don't, but despite that, I will no longer get to be a part of their life until they are in college.

Is there even a way for me to get out of this?,"I am 16 years old and plan to kill myself right before my final's results are released which is about 2 months from now. I have been abused by my father ever since i could remember and have had no one to share my problems with, especially since my mother left me when i was 4. I really really really really despise my father for everything he put me through and one of the many reasons i want to kill myself is precisely because I know he will suffer beacuse of it. My father is a gambling addict and I am tired of him venting his frustrations when he loses money upon me. We used to be decently rich but he gambled everything away to the point of bankruptcy and huge debts. I started having suicidal thoughts when I was 12 which was right after he got out of jail for domestic abuse. My step-mother had attempted to take her own life in front of the family and it is honestly very traumatising. Not only that my father has been scolding his own dad (my grandfather) to the point that he admits he wants to die too. I think I am like this now because of the 8 months my father spent in jail. I tasted freedom for the 1st time in my life and my step mother opened my eyes to the abuse I was receiving. If i still thought the abuse was normal then maybe I could have been handling this better. Being born in an asian household, perhaps this is normal for many but I am seriously having trouble coping right now.

I am just too tired to continue living. As the eldest brother and most fluent english speaker, much responsibility and expectaions have been placed upon me and I am tired of helping. My father always needs me to do stuff for him (paying bills, filing tax) and on several occasions I am incapable of doing them, I would get scolded for being useless. How is that even reasonable, no school would teach about this stuff and him being 30+ years older than me means he should be the one who knows this stuff. My father and stepmum have a very bad relationship and will always badmouth about each other behind their backs to ME. And I always have to lie to both that they did not say anything about each other. I am constantly fat-shamed by my father since i overate due to depression and also expected to do well in my studies.

Right now I hate every single member of my family, my grandfather who is afraid of my father and will not hesitate to throw me under the bus to save himself. My younger sister who is very spoiled by my father and mother. My younger brother who I have opened up to about my feelings but only got ignored and laughed at. My stepmum who now keeps pestering me to stand up to my father since i'm 'more useful to him so he will listen', which of course will always end badly because my father will always manage to talk me down. And most of all, my father who is the source of all my problems. If only he did not exist, maybe i could have been happier somewhere else.

2 months ago, I tried killing myself ather having done no studying for my preliminary exams. However I chickened out and decided to help myself out of this situation. I made a plan to get a job and move out as soon as I could and then maybe I would be happy. I would have been very poor but as long as my father isn't around, i was sure i could manage. I was talked to by multiple teachers asking why my results were so bad/not the usual standard. But when i could have reached out about the abuse, i got worried that i was going to blow everything out of proportion and told them our family was in a difficult financial situation which is true but not the whole story. Because of this i did not receive the help I should have gotten and I have sinc then given up on continuing to live.

I realised how futile it was to continue living. Even if I was to get a job, forced conscription for 2 years when I'm 18 means I will lose it anyway. For at least another 5 years I have to share the same roof with him and I definitely could not keep sane for that long. Even if I managed to get a decent job, then what? I would be spending a good portion of my life trying to pay off his debt and that's just thinking long term. My finals will definitely make him beat me up which will not be the first time it happened. What I am most afraid of is the destruction of my phone which is the only reason that keeps me going. I love the internet and the many games I play and always look forward to the newest updates. It is the only reason i tried to escape my situation previously and how I convinced myself to not end my life. So with all the hardships I have to face in the future, I came to the conclusion that killing myself before my results are in is the best.

I apologise for writing so much, this is like a summary of my very short life. If I were to look at things positively, maybe my death would bring about a good change in my father. If it made his wrath worse, maybe my stepmum would garner the courage to call the cops on him again and i doubt his sentence would be as lenient. And if no significant change occurs, I am satisfied with the thought that my father would be suffering a lot more from his own actions. The son he has called useless this entire time will finally become useless and he will regret ever hurting me. For those who believe that family comes first and that they will be the ones suffering after a loved one's suicide, I doubt i would care if i was dead. I am very aware what I am trying to do is very selfish, after all he did raise me for 16 years. However I just want to not help them anymore, not when i am taken for granted. I doubt many fo you read this far after seeing the length. Never would I have thought I would post my story online which could potentially put me in danger but honestly i do not care much anymore.

He’s been kinda in and out of my life for years and he’s always had a shitty life; but I’m not going to get into that right now. Anyways, he was the person I was closest to although it probably was not that way because we rarely ever talked at all, and he barely tolerated me even though I have never done a single awful thing to him in my life. He’s always been my favourite person but he’s never really cared about me as much. In October, he murdered someone. I won’t disclose too much info but he murdered a boy in cold blood. The news hit me as hard as anything in my life has ever done. I never knew the victim but the fact that my brother is a murderer and the boy is dead hit me in such a terrible way. I stayed up for three days afterward, the longest I’ve ever stayed awake, and I had a massive panic attack which has resulted in some of the worse DP/DR that could ever be experienced. I have never felt so fucking sick in my life and I just don’t know what to do. I cry for that boy and also the grief that my only brother murdered him and is going to prison. I’ve never craved death so much in my life.

"Of course money isn't everything, but is it bad that I want to kill myself for not being able to make money?","Depression &amp; anxiety has taken over. It took my power away to do anything.

 My ability to work, to be happy, to make a way for myself, is all gone.

What's the point when you don't even feel anything anymore?

The pain that has grown from lacking money is so great, that I just feel numb. 

And on top of all that, I don't feel good enough for anyone or anything.

At this point, I just hate myself, my existence, and who I am for not being able to take care of myself. 

I feel like the world would be better off without me. 

What does life even want from me? Why'd it choose me to be born? Just so I can suffer from this type of stress?

I feel like my grades will decide if I kill myself or keep going.,"I recently started my freshman year of high school, and it's been fucking brutal. I had excellent grades up until the pandemic hit, where virtual school in eighth grade instantly made me realize that I had a major procrastination problem. Since the pandemic was new at the time, we were able to pass with decent grades. Fast forward to the start of high school, and it was the worst 9 weeks of my life. It feels like one missing assignment spirals me into tons more. Assignments that I know should take less than an hour take multiple. I feel like my procrastination is caused by the lack of authority in virtual school. When a teacher is in the classroom, I always felt obligated to do the work, which I can now see helped me alot. The first 9 weeks of high school usually caused me to cry every other week (which makes me feel like a fucking baby since I'm a male). The only motivation nowadays is not wanting to disappoint my parents. Whenever I look around my house I think about everything they did for me, leading me to always get fucking sappy and apologetic but do only a few things to actually improve the problem. Once the second 9 weeks began, I thought this would be a new era for my grades, but nope. I'm back to a constant cycle of procrastination, guilt, and sadness after only a week or two of steady grades. There has been a tiny improvement with my procrastination, but if I fail my first year of high school after doing excellently in all classes before it, then I might just overdose because that's just fucking sad. I constantly think if I should do it or not, but my head always reminds itself of the absolute devastation that I know my parents would feel. They're some of the most loving people I've ever known (obviously) yet I know I won't do shit. And it's all my fault. Whenever I cry and my parents hear and try to comfort me, I can't help but feel like a huge attention whore (I actually feel like sort of an attention whore for writing this) I keep telling myself ""next week you'll finally fix yourself and your grades"" but it never happens.

Some advice would be appreciated. 19 M (kinda long),"To start this off i should probably give context to my life.

I was born with multiple malformations on my legs, one of them being my right leg not being able to grow as fast as my left (from both the knee and the hip) so i was forced to have many operations throughout my life. The first one being when i was around 6 weeks old, continuing up until last year. In total i would say i had over 45 operations done, and last year i found out ALOT of them were unnecessary and overly detrimental. I was also the victim of malpractice which i am currently involved in a lawsuit against that said doctor. I pretended to be happy most of my life, firstly it was childish ignorance then as i grew it turned into an act of myself, as i couldn't bare to watch my parents suffering any more because of me. It worked for awhile but last year, as i got the news about my malpractice and all of the operations done being mostly useless, i broke. I pretty much gave up the act and begged my parents to let me see a therapist so i can get diagnosed. I was diagnosed with depression pretty much in my first session and have been taking medication since then. Since having so many operations my feet are mostly scar tissue, making me have incredible nerve pains which are incurable, i also have a high tolerance to regular pain killers making it harder and harder to keep going. After almost 12 years of only physical pain, emotional pain and sadness i am tired. Recently found out my dad hasn't been happy since i was born so that's something that adds to my sadness.

I also have extreme sadistic urges whenever i get really angry and depressive. Not necessarily at myself cause i know i will not kill myself, no matter how deranged i made a vow to myself and i made my code of honor to never break those. The only way i will ever kill myself is by accident or if i were to ever lay my hand upon a woman (hit her or worse). Love your family and never hit a woman. These are my life rules. But i feel more and more deranged as the days pass by, i feel like i will snap one day and strangle a random person on the street that looks at me funny, and worse of all i know that i will partly feel good about doing it. I have tried everything to reduce my seething anger ( meditation, drugs, alcohol, hobbies, therapy, talking about it ) but nothing except physical exhaustion helped ( that also made me be ok for a few hours max)  and being disabled denies me of many things related to physical activities so my question to you, reading this, is. What could i do so i won't be drawn to killing someone in the future.

I also had my first relationship which ended after a few months because i entered my annually autumn depression, and she said she couldn't deal with it with me, broke up over the phone, first person i ever loved outside family :D

Sorry if i added things as i went, this was a pretty rough way to summarize my life but i did my best.

Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. I didn't miss hearing you and your childish voice during remote learning. Stop asking me. What am I supposed to say?

"I have effectively no family, and I feel so alone.","Parents got divorced when I was in kindergarten; afterwards, my mother had partial custody of me. Then, one day, she just stopped picking me up for visitation -- but she was an addict (police busted the meth lab her roommates ran in her backyard, and the judge sent her to rehab...but then she just ran away from it, etc) and so I try not to hold it against her.

My father was a great man, who'd lived an interesting life and worked hard to provide the good life for me -- but then he went bankrupt when I was seventeen, and it went downhill fast. His business partner cheated him out of almost everything he was entitled to, and so we went from ""working class"" millionaires to living on handouts. He wouldn't drop his standard of living, and wouldn't prioritize bills before cigarettes, so he'd end up spending $7 of his last $10 on cigarettes and putting $3 in gas in the car, just enough to where he could drive to work the next day. If I asked him to stop, he'd threaten to kick me out of the car and force me to walk home. If I begged him to stop, he'd threaten to kick me out of the house and said he ""had no son."" If I asked my grandmother to intervene, she'd shout at me for spending $1 on a sweet tea at a gas station, when I skipped eating the night before because I didn't think we had the money. If my father took the money I had set aside to pay for my prescriptions, I was supposed to not say anything.

One day, I broke. My father got angry at his broken laptop, and refused to drive to his mother's to use her computer to file his income taxes (the EIN credit is massive when finding $5 on the sidewalk means you're eating good that night, and it was the last night to file,) so I began shouting. I screamed ""I can't do this anymore,"" and I screamed ""Please help me keep loving you"" -- and he'd mock me, sniffing his cigarettes as he chainsmoked them in my face. When he threatened to commit suicide, I called my grandmother, and after I threw a picture frame on the floor, he began to punch me in the face. I never punched back, because I couldn't bring myself to be the man that beat the person I idolized as a child. 

I called the cops. He lied and said I hit first, and my grandmother lied and said they were just ""wrestling."" She screamed at me, saying I had ""bitten the hand that fed me"", and said I couldn't live with her (despite her having a spare bedroom and complete financial ability to help.) She relented when she saw me call the only men's shelter in my city, and was told that they had no vacancies for the foreseeable future. Otherwise, she was completely fine with me being homeless.

So I moved in with her, and within three days, I got a job. I worked it for 40 hours a week in the southern heat, and though I hated every minute of it, I never threatened to quit. When I got COVID from work and my employer sent me home for two weeks, she screamed at me and said I'd ""made a big mistake."" When I got a concussion at work and was told by my doctor to stay home for ten days, she screamed at me for being ""lazy and with no ambition"", and made me go to work (I hadn't been able to sleep the night before, which is common in concussions, and so by the time my shift was over I had been awake for 25 hours straight.) I broke down crying in her car afterwards, and she treated me like I was a child.

**I feel so alone.** I can risk death at work, but I'm still ""lazy"" to her; she knows fully what all my father did after bankruptcy, and yet she still thinks we should ""reunify"" for the sake of the family. I'm being kicked out for Christmas, as my father will be coming over to her house, and yet I'll be told to be grateful that I get to come back home the next day. I'll go to Thanksgiving with my uncle and cousins, and yet they'll undoubtedly think of me as lazy, because my grandmother and father told them as much. I wanted to keep relationships with my family after leaving my father's house (I was about to move across the country until my housing arrangement fell through at the last moment, and considered never talking to these people again,) but it feels as if I am utterly worthless to them. What's the point of a family if they treat you like you're nothing?

And so here I am. No mother, no father. No degree, no hope. I try to be charitable in the hopes that it'll make god like me (I spent $130 on a woman's groceries the other day, when her EBT card was declined,) but I feel like it's fruitless to hold out for a blessing like that.

I just want it to end.

I want to die but I don't want my batchmates to add another obituary to my batch's (currently unreleased) yearbook,"This year has been rough for all of us. I keep seeing news articles of students committing suicide every now and then and it's pretty disheartening, especially since the government and the department of education do not want to take responsibility for it. ""Only the strong survive.""

I really live in a pathetic country but can't really move anywhere else because it's honestly shit anywhere else. If anyone can recommend me a country with a decent and stable government, please do so.

Anyway, just got my results from an exam I took a few weeks ago and not surprisingly, I failed. I did not study at all for the exam, so I'm not surprised, but at the same time, I keep beating myself up for not being able to work or study or do anything productive. Hell, all I can do is play video games and sleep. Haven't passed anything for college the past month, so I'm probably gonna fail the semester and get kicked out.

When I talk to my friends, my family, and my boyfriend, I always try to keep a happy-go-lucky and sanguine front on because I honestly feel everyone is just tired of me talking about my problems and that I don't want to add on to any of their burdens. I'm also just waiting for my friends to slowly cut me off (which kinda seems impossible because they care about me a lot) and for my boyfriend to get tired of my poor mental health and shitty personality and break up with me. That way, I can either kill myself or just become a NEET/hermit after either barely surviving my undergrad or something. I don't see myself with other people in the future anyway. One of my best friends has cut me off already and blocked me on twitter for some reason. She never communicates properly anyway, but it's still sad.

Aside from that, I hate most of my batchmates because they're annoying, clout chasing dipshits, always calling out people and shading others on social media for minor things, when you can just keep it to yourself or talk to the people you have a problem with personally. I tweeted something once on a private account (complained about groupmates not helping and said that it was fair that the school couldn't put them on break because they haven't finished anything) and someone called me out and said that it wasn't nice to tweet that. I was so annoyed with the person who called me out, I already was annoyed with them before because their clout-chasing behavior, that I was just like, ""Yeah, I guess it's time to quit Twitter."" Being off social media helps but I still feel like it's pointless to be alive.

Anyway, I just don't have the energy to fully kill myself now because one of my batchmates died suddenly and another one has cancer (but will hopefully survive). I feel like I'm just alive to play games and wait for updates for the games I have, especially with the current pandemic going on -- why didn't I die instead of him? He had such a bright future -- he wanted to work at NASA and yet, he died. Meanwhile, if I were to die (which I don't mind, it's better to be insignificant than someone significant because you get to avoid all the responsibilities that come with being important), I have to be the one to manually end my life. So stupid. Wish I could just die right now.

This whole thing feels like I'm in limbo and I wish I could float away.",sak1yosh1da,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jydrql/i_want_to_die_but_i_dont_want_my_batchmates_to/,year ha rough u keep seeing news article student committing suicide every pretty disheartening especially since government department education want take responsibility strong survive really live pathetic country really move anywhere else honestly shit anywhere else anyone recommend country decent stable government please anyway got result exam took week ago surprisingly failed study exam surprised time keep beating able work study anything productive hell play video game sleep passed anything college past month probably gonna fail semester get kicked talk friend family boyfriend always try keep happy go lucky sanguine front honestly feel everyone tired talking problem want add burden also waiting friend slowly cut kinda seems impossible care lot boyfriend get tired poor mental health shitty personality break way either kill become neet hermit either barely surviving undergrad something see people future anyway one best friend ha cut already blocked twitter reason never communicates properly anyway still sad aside hate batchmates annoying clout chasing dipshits always calling people shading others social medium minor thing keep talk people problem personally tweeted something private account complained groupmates helping said wa fair school put break finished anything someone called said nice tweet wa annoyed person called already wa annoyed clout chasing behavior wa like yeah guess time quit twitter social medium help still feel like pointless alive anyway energy fully kill one batchmates died suddenly another one ha cancer hopefully survive feel like alive play game wait update game especially current pandemic going die instead bright future wanted work nasa yet died meanwhile die mind better insignificant someone significant get avoid responsibility come important one manually end life stupid wish could die right whole thing feel like limbo wish could float away,want die want batchmates add another obituary batch currently unreleased yearbook,sak 1 yo sh 1 da,3288,114,sak 1 yo sh 1 da year ha rough u keep seeing news article student committing suicide every pretty disheartening especially since government department education want take responsibility strong survive really live pathetic country really move anywhere else honestly shit anywhere else anyone recommend country decent stable government please anyway got result exam took week ago surprisingly failed study exam surprised time keep beating able work study anything productive hell play video game sleep passed anything college past month probably gonna fail semester get kicked talk friend family boyfriend always try keep happy go lucky sanguine front honestly feel everyone tired talking problem want add burden also waiting friend slowly cut kinda seems impossible care lot boyfriend get tired poor mental health shitty personality break way either kill become neet hermit either barely surviving undergrad something see people future anyway one best friend ha cut already blocked twitter reason never communicates properly anyway still sad aside hate batchmates annoying clout chasing dipshits always calling people shading others social medium minor thing keep talk people problem personally tweeted something private account complained groupmates helping said wa fair school put break finished anything someone called said nice tweet wa annoyed person called already wa annoyed clout chasing behavior wa like yeah guess time quit twitter social medium help still feel like pointless alive anyway energy fully kill one batchmates died suddenly another one ha cancer hopefully survive feel like alive play game wait update game especially current pandemic going die instead bright future wanted work nasa yet died meanwhile die mind better insignificant someone significant get avoid responsibility come important one manually end life stupid wish could die right whole thing feel like limbo wish could float away want die want batchmates add another obituary batch currently unreleased yearbook
I could use some advice (gender dysphoria),"I recently turned 22 and have been dealing with gender dysphoria for a little over 10 years, and for a lot of that time I've had suicidal thoughts anywhere from 'kinda wish i was dead' to actually cutting myself. Im not sure that I could go through with actually ending my life because of my sister and best friend who are my reason for living right now but between the dysphoria and multiple chronic medical problems my life seems to just spiral downwards. I want to transition but not only is most of my family hostile to lgbtq people, I would never pass and im not sure I want even more negativity in my life from people who hate me for trying to be closer on the outside to how i feel on the inside. I don't think i really want to die, I just don't want to live as who I am. I've read a lot of other peoples posts around the internet on depression and a common advice thats given is to find things in life you enjoy, but i feel like everything i do is tainted by the dysphoria and theres nothing in life i really enjoy or look forward to. I have no goals and just thinking about continuing as the person i am for longer ends with me emptying a few cans of beer and listening to whatever music makes me feel even slightly less crap. It hurts to look at my own body and I dont know what to do. I would really appreciate any advice anyone has.

My life is better but I still feel ashamed,"I went to therapy, worked on myself, went from unemployed and financially sinking to gainfully employed with enough left over to save. I have my health and my friends. But there are still nights where I pick up the gun and think about ending it. 

I stayed with a man who cheated on me multiple times, with all sorts of people. Often he paid for sex. He would hide it, and tell me he loved me. When I found out he would cry, I would cry and he'd promise not to do it again. And then he'd do it again. I stayed because I loved him and I couldn't afford to leave. I was unemployed, my life was a wreck and he was letting me stay with him and paying for the groceries. He would cuddle with me in bed, help me with job applications, take me out on dates and hide his phone. I knew what was going on. 

I worked hard to ""fix"" him. I kept on forgiving him. After a while he did stop cheating. When he lost his libido. Now he says he loves me and wants to spend the rest of his life with me. I have what I wanted, he says he loves me and he means it. But I'm ashamed for staying with him. I was so hurt when he cheated and it still hurts. And I'm ashamed I let him cheat on me so many times.

Yo... anyone?,"So, long story short, i have attempted suicide last week by not drinking for 10 days straight but it didn't go well, in the afternoon of the tenth day i realized that i needed to wait at least another 4-5 to MAYBE have results and it was getting real though so i decided to do an U turn and now i was planning on suiciding for drinking too much as it is easier and it would work in just a couple of hours.

"Today’s the day, I hate waking up in this skin, I’m an awful person, I’ll be glad to leave","Im sorry, every single day I’m woken up with the same feelings and they don’t seem to be dissipating or even slightly going away, I’ve hurt so many people in such a short time and the idea that I could even do it again is so destroying and debilitating that I just can’t face that. I’m sorry for it all, I wish I could wake up feeling better and believing that things could Infact be better but I just know it can’t. I’ve not been happy with my life for a long period of time, and anytime I do get happiness, Every time I bring someone good in to my life, someone that genuinely makes me happy and someone I would do anything to make happy, I find some way to hurt them a lot, my fucked up thoughts and worries ruin things and makes me in to a selfish obsessed arsehole who breaks people’s trust, treats them like shit and ultimately shows them that they’d be better off without me. I let the same problems that have been engrained in to me flood over and I push people to the point where they no longer see the value in me being in their life, and I truly don’t blame them. I don’t value me so it’s not surprising that the people I treat like shit don’t either. I am an awful person, I’ve treated the few people who I was so lucky to have close to me, all so disgustingly bad, saying and doing things that wouldn’t be expected of someone who is meant to care for someone. There isn’t an excuse, mental health isn’t an excuse to treat anyone badly or be a toxic horrible person. 





I destroy relationships, I do it through my own selfish means without even realising I’m doing it half the time, I subconsciously am an awful person, people welcome me in to their life and I fuck it up time and time again. Every single person who has been with me is now happier without me in their life, their life’s actually improved when I wasn’t in it. That’s so unbelievably telling of the person I am and the things I do. It doesn’t matter how many chances I’m offered, I always never learn and I continue to say disgustingly stupid things that I don’t mean, but I don’t think about the things I say I just say them without the social awareness to understand how they come across, I do it so much all the time and all it does is hurt people. This isn’t a self pity thing where I feel not good enough or feel like no one cares or understands me, it’s that people do care but I hurt them and treat them in such awful ways that they can’t have me in their life anymore, for their own sake. I’m not a good person, I’m a fucking awful person. So why spend time trying to improve myself when I don’t even believe that anything will work to change me, and then eventually end up hurting someone else? Nothing will change who I am. I’m an emotional manipulator, a controller and a horrible fucking person. I abuse people and it’s really that simple. 





I don’t know why I do the terrible things I do, but I don’t blame anyone for not wanting me in their life, I wouldn’t want me in it either. No amount of therapy, self help books, medication or “learning from your past” will change that because I just keep doing it and even though I try everything I can to change, it still happens. Why should I need a book, CBT, DBT you name what ever kind of therapy you want, just to function like a normal person? To treat people normally, to not act out in incredibly awful ways? Why can’t I just be normal?  Most people go through their life having friends, relationships, family members that they never treat like shit, who never act in such awful ways who don’t need therapy, medication, self help to get better or to just be better. I’m not normal, I’m this way because that’s the person I am, and the only person who can actually change me Is me, but I’ve tried time and time again, Im done trying to pretend I’ll ever be anything other than an awful, horrible, deceptive, manipulative piece of shit. My life has literally been littered with shame and guilt and no matter how bad I want to change or how much I try the same things keep happening, I keep pushing away and hurting the people I care so much about. It always gets to the point where I’ve hurt the person I love too much and they need to leave my life for their own good or my issues are so deep ridden that I’ll never be that person they want me to be, I just hurt people and have never been worth it to anyone, and I can’t blame them. 





I never felt good enough growing up, not from anyone, my family, my parents I always felt like I was letting down or annoying, always falling out with and arguing with and I’m sorry that I was never the child you wanted me to be, it shows I was born that way, it’s me I’m the problem, my brother ive never been close with or talked to really, didn’t have many friends at school and the few I did either cut me out their life when they met better ones and the one person that stayed I pushed away by treating him awfully, and the couple of friends I have now, I fear doing the same to. I don’t want to hurt anyone ever again and the truth is everyone is better with me not in their life they just haven’t realised it yet. No relationships should have the amount of problems I bring to them, 4 years, 1 and a half years or two months it doesn’t matter, I bring an abundance of toxicity and pain to them and I don’t think that will ever change, I’m sorry to those who have experienced that first hand and the shit I did to you, the tears I brought you, the relentless problems. You wanted me in your life but eventually realised I’m not the person you thought I was. It’s just who I am, internally. I’m thankful for the experiences and happiness that these people have brought me but truly sorry and ashamed for the damage I’ve done. For not repaying your love and support. I bring no positive qualities to people’s life’s and never will, I bring no positive qualities to my own life and never will. Its soul destroying. 





I wish I wasn’t me and I can’t continue to live, being me. I’m honestly sorry to anyone this hurts by the decision to do this, I wanted to be normal, I wish I could be so fucking badly but I’m just not, i never will be. I’m honestly a weirdo, an unsociable freak. I make decisions, awful decisions, awful reactions to situations that no one in their right mind would make, I’ve always done it and I always will because I’m fucked in the head. Everyday to me feels the exact same and has for nearly 2 months now, I’m trapped literally reliving all the awful things I did to people and the fact my life consists of the same shit everyday right now is a product of that. A product of me. Even though I don’t want to hurt people, yet I do time and time again, all of my life has consisted of losing people who mean a lot to me and realise they are better off. I’ve never had many friends or people I felt connected to, always felt in a way isolated and it’s not that crazy that when I meet someone I love that I expect too much from them, I become clingy and pushy, I am extremely selfish, I’m a horrible person by nature. 





So many people have left my life and been better off, while every time I’m left facing me and the reality of it all, I don’t have anything worth it. Nothing I do gives me purpose, and anything that does make me happy I ruin. I feel so empty so pointless, literally nothing makes me happy or matters to me, and it’s so bad because it should, I should care and be happy but I’m not, I have a car, one year off a degree, stable job and money but that’s never mattered to me, I’ve never taken the opportunities to make a friend group, I wake up everyday to no texts or messages from anyone because I’m not a fun person to have in someone’s life, other people are. I get told over and over that I need to learn to be alone, but I’ve been alone my entire life I don’t do things that people my age should be doing or things I want to do because having people to do them with is what makes them special and matter. I’m sick of being alone. literally my entire life has been me being my only real friend, and anyone who does come in to my life I push away or isolate myself from them because I know I’ll eventually hurt them. Any social interaction I’m invited to or I’m part of I act like a controlling manipulative weirdo and want to make it all about me, no one wants me in their life and it’s not that hard to see why, I’m not someone is fun to be around or have in life. 





Im an embarrassment to people and I’m an embarrassment to myself, I wake up every day alone to do the same stuff over and over again, just trying to get to the next day, why would anyone want that? Everyday I want to die because this is not the person I ever wanted to be, or how I ever wanted to treat people, but it’s the reality of it. I’ve always had the idea to move country and get away, start my life again, but I’ve done that in certain aspects and I’ve fucked it up time and time again, the same stuff keeps happening, because the issue isn’t other people, it’s me. When people come in to my life they wonder why I do the certain things I do why my social media is so sparse, why I’m not out with people as much why I don’t have many friends, why I spend so much time on places like Reddit and I’m focused so much on self help, it’s because Its an escape to the reality of my life, about not wanting to be me and realising that there really aren’t many people in my life that see me as important to them or would consider me a good friend. It’s always been like that, I’ve always felt different from the rest and always been alone, it’s probably a big reason why I cling so much on to relationships because without that, I have virtually no social interaction and losing that person is literally losing everything I’ve ever wanted. I’m alone in life because I’m not good to have in others life’s, that’s been made clear to me time and time again. When I hurt someone like I have to people I’ve been lucky enough to love, I just choose to remove myself from their life at this point because it’s clear they’d be so much better off, forgetting ever meeting me, I’m a negative thing in their life and I can’t blame them for thinking that, it’s been that way my entire life, being someone that hinders people’s life’s, not benefits them. It’s why I have nothing. Im a hurdle to a happier life for them. I always was left feeling wonder why I never experienced anything with family when people spend so much time with their parents and get along with them, doing so much with friends being able to socialise and just be wanted by others, I’ve never had that and don’t think I ever will, I’m not deserving of it ive had chances to get that life I always wanted but being 25 and seeing where I am and how the same patterns continue and continue, it’s not worth the amount of serious therapy, medication everything to potentially be better, it won’t ever happen, I’m scared of being 30 35 40 or older and still having the same problems over and over, that’s not a life I Want to live, it’s never been. Should anyone go through life trying their hardest to not be the person they are? Is that a way to live? Waking up everyday trying to not be you? That’s been me my entire life, imagining, dreaming and sometimes praying to be someone different to be a person who has a life worth living, something about myself to make me care for the life I live with people who make me happy and who I can experience so much with. I’m tired of all of this pain and loneliness, it’s constantly realising I’m never gonna live that life I wanted and be with the people I do, because I’ll just hurt and hurt over and over again. I’m not happy being me and can’t imagine I ever will be, I live each day thinking about my past and the happiness I had and how I find ways each time to destroy it and that’s an issue with me as a person. I wish that things were different and my life wasn’t a continued feeling of regret and hate for myself but it’s not. I hate everything I’ve done, the way I let myself be and I just can’t keep waking up with the overbearing shame of it all. No matter how hard I try, the amount of effort, emotionally and mentally to be a better person, the person I want to be, it never changes. I repeat the same selfish, manipulative patters every time, I leave those who I care so much about freaked out and scared by my actions and who could blame them? I literally push the people I love to be scared of me, their families not wanting them to be involved with me anymore their friends thinking they’d be be better off without me, and where does that leave me? Facing the reality of my actions of the person I am of the person I let myself be time and time again, I’m a monster a fucking freak and someone no one should have the misfortune of having in their life. They deserve better, so much better, and I absolutely do not. I put myself in these situations I create them, I give myself the false hope that I can be happy, have someone in my life that does make me happy, someone I truly fucking care so much about but I always, always find some way to fuck it up, to ruin the thing that I love so much, and then I’m left thinking about this stuff day to day realising how much of an awful person I am, I never learned the first time it happened, the second or third so who’s to say I will now? I appreciate everyone who has tried to help me and support me through this hard time, you tried you’re absolute best but I’m too far gone, this was inevitable it always has been. 





The inclination of hope was the only thing I’ve had to keep going in the last years. That things could improve I could get that life I wanted, that I could have the people in it that matter the most. It’s been rightfully shot down time and time again even when I try to fix things, commit to being better I delude myself to think I’ll ever change. The reality is when I hear the tone of their voice when talking to me. The coldness of it, the lack of interest in me or having anything to do with me, and not just them everyone around them family and friends alike. They don’t want anything to do with someone like me, I had people that used to be excited to see me spend time with me and truly brought me so much happiness and I’ve pushed away like always because I can’t ever be the person they hoped I’d be, the person I hoped I’d be. They see me for what I truly am, a horrible, selfish and destructive person. They have every right to no longer want someone like me in their life and feel they would be better off if I wasn’t part of it. I deserve this all of this. It’s why I’m alone, why Im the person I am, the choices I make are my own and I live with those choices every single day. Everyone would be better off without me in their life that’s the only thing I’m sure about. I hate no one but myself so please don’t think or believe that any of this was directed outwards, I cared and still care so much about those that I hurt but my actions have always been telling of the person I am and the life I live. This isn’t a case of just pushing through this hard time because I’ve tried to distract myself, meeting people, watching tv, playing games, going out walks talking to my family and grandparents and everything you are supposed to do in hard times, but my life has been this constant feeling of being unwanted and lack of identity, I don’t know who I am or what matters to me, the only times I’ve ever felt truly myself and happy is when I am with those that I love and to have people that mean so much to me, and holding out hope that a person like that will once again appear in my life isn’t worth all this constant hate for myself. I mentally and physically just can’t do this anymore, hurting people I care about and put so much in to loving, and then have them leave my life. I don’t know what’s wrong with me, I never have and anytime I think things have gotten better I find a way to fall back to where I was but this time it’s so much worse, I genuinely believe there’s something defective with me as a person, I think I’m internally broken, I’m a crazy person who obsesses over being someone else. I hate the skin I am in. 




It hurts so much to care so much about someone, to try your hardest to be the best person you can be, and yet continue to fuck it all up, because you can’t change. There is no light at the end of the tunnel for me, and going on living each day wishing I wasn’t me isn’t something I want to do anymore. I miss the feeling of having someone I care so much about in my life, that feeling of connection and love, it takes so much for me to feel that feeling of love and belief that someone loves me but every time, every fucking time I ruin it, I change their perception of me, I show them why I’m not someone they want in their life. Now I wake up everyday with constant thoughts each day are of the people I’ve hurt and lost due to my actions and just how fucking weird and horrible I am, I don’t want to keep doing that, I can’t justify it in anyway, I’m pathetic. I don’t see how anyone could ever love someone so fucked up. No one deserves to be treated the way I treated people. I sincerely hope they live a happy life, they absolutely deserve it, because even though it all ended through me being so horrible to them, they brought me happiness that meant the world to me, genuinely. 



This isn’t anyone’s fault but mine so please don’t feel guilty for it, no one can save me from myself or the things I do over and over again, so please don’t look for someone or something to blame, this was my decision, something I caused and created and this is the only thing I’ve felt sure about. I’m really sorry I wish I was a better, different person, but I’ll never be the person I want to be or how I want to be for others. These have been the loneliest, lowest, most self hating months of my entire life, I can’t keep running from the person I am and the things I do. I just can’t bare to see someone I care so much about leave my life again and decide they are better off because of the things I do, my life isn’t what I ever wanted it to be, and the way I treat people isn’t the way I ever wanted to treat them, but I always cross the line and lose the person who means more than anything to me. I’m a disgusting person and that’s all I ever have been, I assure you the world will be a better place without horribly toxic people like me in it. There is no going back now.

I'm feeling so sad. I hate myself.,"I feel like crying right now. I don't know what's wrong with me. I am mentally and emotionally not okay. I have been feeling so lazy and just want to be on my phone all the time. I have been feeling easily annoyed and angry lately which I hate.

I am tired of my brain. I am tired of myself. I am tired of my life. I am tired of existing. I'm tired of being unhappy. I'm tired of being a ball of negativity. I hate life and I really hate myself. I want to disappear. 
 
I was crying in the shower today thinking about how ugly and weird I am and have always been. I feel like a burden and should be wiped away. I wish I was cool and normal like everyone else. I wish I was beautiful and confident. I wish I was talented. I wish I had someone to love me but I'm too ugly and feel undeserving of love. I wouldn't want anyone to have to deal with me when they could get way better. I want to die and sometimes I think about killing myself. I wish I was brave enough to do it but I have too many worries.

I want to be good enough. I want to connect with people on a deep emotional level but I can't find that. I'm also too lame, weird, and boring. I love people more than they love me. I feel like no one truly cares about me. I feel so alone. I wish I was someone's best friend. I wish I was part of a friend group that finds me fun and cares about me. I'm always ignored and left for someone better.  I wish I had people to talk to that will listen to me and be there for me. 

I want to die. I hate life and wish I was never born. I hate myself for being such an ugly loser burden. I can't take it. It's so hard. There's no one I can tell this to. I want to cry. Sometimes I'm just so done. I'm so freaking tired. Please help me. :(

no where to go,"i have been suffering depression for a long time now. I was cheated out of my dream career in the UK. Returnd home was never the same got into a job but could never ever work, with having your lifelong dream shattered. Finally i found something i loved i bcame profssionally acclaimed in financial markts trading. I did really well for years but only for depression to destroy everything, which was amplified by a girl screwing m over. Not her fault i was warned by a lot of ppl to keep away from her. 

Then i again recharged startd trading really well, and was going to get married. Yet again it fell apart and that led me to breakdown emotionally ending up with losing so much money and getting into debt.

I tried to hang myself from the fan aftr multiple suicide attempts of overdosing. I didnt die because the fan came down hitting my leg on floor. Today money is a big issue, my family hates me, my age is such i wont get a job and debt repayment every month.

Multiple times i hv overdosed since but somehow manage to bee alive since the suffering must go on i guess. 

I think about killing myself everyday. I still trade with some money i have but its never enough, due to the debt paymnts. I smoke, i have to hear evryday from my family as to how i lost so much money and that i should stop smoking. Reminding me of my misery doesnt help stopping smoking.

None of whom have even given a shit to reach out to you?

I haven’t see anyone for months. I want to die because I’m unable to socially interact and hearing people complain about the lack of interaction gives me zero reason to live and a strong urge to kill myself.

"Suicide, because of COVID.","No one is going to read this, because no one cares, I've seen the threads here. 

I have my plan all put together, I got the final missing parts to it today. I'm not going to kill myself right now this minute. The watch has started though, the clock is just ticking and ticking away.

Everything I've seen and read points to me ending up in the hospital in the eventual case of when I get COVID. I'm a big dude, not as big as I use to be, but I've always been able to keep up. I've made some lifestyle change for the better in quarantine, but not enough to change the fact of where I'll end up. I also found out I'm going to have to go to the worst hospital system in my state, that's neat. 

If it doesn't kill me in the hospital, then I'm definitely going to be left with permanent lifelong disabilities. The simple fact of the matter is that the life I had before won't be possible post-COVID. There won't be concerts or karaoke nights. There won't be barcrawls or musume trips. Nothing. My friends will move on and simply just replace me. I'm already in my 30s so it's not like I'm going to be making any new friends. What would we even do? 'Hey let's just sit around because I can't breathe anymore, I would say let's talk but again, the breathing thing.'

I could go on and on with the after effects and and thing I won't be able to do. There's strokes, heart attacks, seizures, permanent memory loss, permanent sexual dysfunction, the list goes on and on and on and on and it DOESN'T GET ANY FUCKING BETTER. The worst of it all that so much of it is out of my control. I can't do a fucking thing about it.  

I use to hate myself but I got to a good place. I was fucking happy for once in my life. I had a group of friends, I had events I ran in my local city, I was seeing someone but that ended because of COVID, I had an job and a great side gig. Left with the job now, but hey it did let me buy the things I needed for this. Now I'm here looking down the perveriable barrel of a gun I can't control. 

I'm not going to sit and let myself be crippled by it. I don't want to see myself become a shell of myself. 

My only regret is the people who caused this will never fucking pay for their actions. They'll be fine! Get to go on living their lives without a care in the world. I really hope there is a hell.

I used to have a lot of friends but I shoved them away at this point. I ask my parents for advice and help and everything they say is absolute dogshit. Oh okay a walk in the park IS GONNA FIX MY MENTAL ILLNESS GOOD FUCKING JOB. I expected someone would have helped me at this point. Hoping for death everyday. Nobody knows. Someone even told me I looked radiant the other day, after crying in my room for half an hour. The act is good at least.

I feel completely alone, and no one understands me at all. It's dramatic, but it's the truth. I should die. I should stop breathing. Stop smiling. I should stop existing and maybe people around me would know at least I was succesful in one thing: killing myself.

Man,"I've  had the thoughts for a long time, the only things holding me back was how devastated my mother and sister would be, I dont want them to be hurt because of my decision. Im the outlier of the family dynamic, im the one who's  the laziest never get shit done, theres nothing ive achieved other than my grades because my family would pressure me to get straight As hard, and the needs to get good grades stook even though they dont care anymore. My mother and sister consistently strive to be big and have done big things with close friends and people they could rely on, goals, things to look forward to they're everything im not.Even though weve been more distant that dosent change what they've done for me before yknow. I just dont have anyone to tell anything on what ive been feeling for the past year, everytime before hand i feel stupid and regret saying it in the first place. Ever since online schooling happen ive had no friends, and beforehand outside of school i never met them, i see their social media all I see is in every friend group ive been in i was, forgettable, replacable, its something ive realized. But even so, none of them arent in my classes and the ones who i do keep up with see me maybe once or twice a month at all, and eachtime we grow more distant. My grades have been worse too, I used to be a straight A student but now i dont care anymore whats the point of doing all this work, all of it feels pointless. Suicidal thoughts have just greatened lately, all things  happening in my life consistently make me realise there is no point, i just want to disspear, no one would care, but even writing this im startint to think theyd eventually forget.

How long does it take to mentally recover from an attempt?,"TL;DR: I attempted suicide earlier this month. I am having trouble recovering. How long will it take to move on from an event like this, and how should one cope?

Almost three weeks ago, I overdosed on Tylenol PM. I had thoroughly researched the effects of acetaminophen, and I knew exactly how much to take. I had already put my affairs in order, cleaned up my bedroom, and written a note. All that was left was to do the deed.

I sat on my bed, shook out the correct number of pills, and cracked open a bottle of water.

I thought I knew what I was doing, but I didn't. I didn't realize how strong the ""PM"" portion of the medicine would be. I assumed that I would get slightly drowsy and then fall into a peaceful slumber.

But that's not how it happened.

Instead of being lulled to sleep, it felt like something was trying to drag me to sleep. It was violent. I became frightened. Less than two hours later, I was in the back of an ambulance on its way to the nearest hospital.

I spent five days in the hospital. Two days in ED and three days in behavioral. I doubt that any of the paramedics or nurses who cared for me will ever see this, but I am forever grateful to them.

Because my attempted method of suicide was an overdose, I was housed with the recovering drug addicts and alcoholics. Initially, I was scared. I had depression. Why were they putting me with people who had substance abuse issues? We were supposed to offer each other support and guidance. What could I possibly learn from druggies and drunks?

It turns out that I could learn a lot. Most of the people there had underlying issued with depression or other mental illnesses, and that is what led them to become dependent on drugs or alcohol. They were some of the wisest and bravest people I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. I couldn’t believe how ignorant and biased I had been.

Now, here I am, three weeks later.

Fortunately, I have fully recovered from my attempt. At least, physically. Of course, my depression is far from being ""cured."" I have been prescribed Zoloft, and I have an appointment with a psychiatrist soon. However, I am still lethargic, unmotivated, and bogged down by a whole host of other symptoms. 

The biggest obstacle I have run into is recovering from this whole affair. For a while, I had trouble sleeping in my bed. I kept thinking about that night. Everytime I laid down, I swore I could smell rotting flesh. When I woke up in the morning, I was surprised that I was still alive. 

I am avoiding school. My professors have sent me concerned messages, and I know that my grades are dropping, but I just can't bring myself to do anything. I have to go to work tomorrow (I took the last two weeks off) but I don't know if I can even manage that. I have been spending my days lounging around the house, sleeping, staring at the T.V., and feebly attempting to get back into my old hobbies.

At first, I was so angry and disgusted with myself. Why am I acting like this? Why can't I move on? Why can't I return to my everyday life? I started to regret going to the hospital. I scorned myself for being too weak to follow through with my plans. I began to wish that I actually had died.

But now I realize that it takes time to recover from something like this. No one should expect someone who survived a suicide attempt to immediately be able to return to their daily lives. It takes time to cope with all of the emotions. I am trying to be patient with myself, and yet...

Are there others that have attempted suicide in the past and struggled to move on? What did you do to help yourself cope?

I'm tired.,"I feel so useless and unheard. No one truly cares how I feel, no one understands what I have to go through.

I'm 26 years, living with my family (parents and sister). I'm from (low)middle class family.
When I was young, I was bullied about being poor, about my shape, and everything. I always felt like a loser. I told my mom and she told me not to worry about it...no one listened to me.

In 2012, my mom got crashed by a car, the police didnt give a fuck about it. My mom's leg was broken back then and we didnt have enough money to go to the hospital. Meanwhile I passed the test for a Medical School but I couldn't go there because we needed money for my mom first. My dream had gone. (It's impossible to try again in my country if you're over 26 years+poor)

After seeing the thing that happened to my mom. I started studying Laws myself. I read too much. I thought I was going to change the system. I thought we all deserve justice no matter who we are. Finally I got to study in Faculty of Law.
But things didnt go so well, I still got bullied by words and actions by classmates and Profs. because I'm poor, I dont have a car, my mom still took me to the Uni by old truck and old motorcycle (3people riding1 motorcycle, my mom, me,my sis). My Uni life was terrible I can say, I still dreamt about it sometimes and woke up crying. Luckily I have few good friends to help me get through it.
In the last year of my Law school, I won a scholarship to study Masters degree  in Europe but had to pay for some stuffs. I told my prof. that I didnt have that much money but I'll try to get it. She told me if I dont have money, she'd give that scholarship to her niece(who's my classmate) and finally she did. I lost it again.

After finished university, I started working as a legal officer. It was a great job with great salary. But its soooo far from home. 
I was happy working there until my boss tried to rape me. I told my coworker, the thing she replied to me was ""It happens here"". I was shocked, I told my parents, they told me to call the police, so I did. And again, the police didnt give a fuck, they said my boss is too big to deal with. And then everyone in that area knew about my story, everyone looked at me like a murder. I talked to my lawyer friends, they couldnt help because I didnt have enough money and power. My parents told me to quit but I didnt. 
One day my boss and the gang came to my room with a gun, he said ""If you dont get out of here, I'll kill you"". I didnt tell anyone about it, I quit and came back home. (He got me 100k debt before I quit)
I got a new job in my hometown. My coworker flirted with me. But I didnt like him...and I didnt know that a woman who works in the office had a crush on him. [CRAZY]
Everything's getting worse. My coworkers(women) started bullying me, spy, hacked my facebook, used my ID number doing bad things, came to my house and threw something in my windows, told my boss that I stole something. My boss talked to me, no one believed me.
Meanwhile...I was with my boyfriend, I told him I wanted to quit this job, I cant handle it anymore, I cried so often. And he helped me. I quit that job. He sends me some money. 

The thing is I'm not happy to be like this. I want to work. I'm still in debt. I applied for like 40 jobs but no one called me. I passed the test to be government officer but they didnt call me (it takes soooo long).
Now I'm tired. I'm jobless. I'm broke. I'm useless. While seeing all my friends getting married, having good jobs, having family, getting new houses. But I'm here, sometimes I dont even have food to eat, no power, no water. I applied for a part time jobs but they said they dont want people who studied Law. (Yeah, they gonna cheat). Sometimes I worked as a part time waitress and they didnt pay or only paid Half. And I could do nothing because no one listened to me.
Yesterday my dad told us that the owner wont let him rent the shop anymore before we dont have money to pay since Covid19 hit. (He couldnt make money for long time tho, I'm the one who pays everything in this house)
Now I feel so stressed and hopeless. Some night I feel like dying, suicide comes across my mind so often. But if I die, no one will take care of my family. 
I'm just tired.

I constantly let my mental health mess with my life and now it may have cost me my career and my family. I want to die,"So the basics are that if I lose my job my family will disown me and I will likely be homeless. I’ve been sacked 3 times from previous jobs because of my depressive state but my current job is my dream career. I have been disowned by my family before and it was the worst time in my life, I had nothing to live for and the only person I had in my life was an abusive boyfriend who I had to stick with because without him I would have been all alone, cold and starving. I have suffered unbelievable trauma and as consequence, my mental health has been in tatters for about 7/8 years. I tried to kill myself when I was 14 and to this day, every time I look back on it, I always wish I’d have tried harder. 

So I took 2 weeks off work for my anxiety recently as the people I work with at my new job have not been welcoming at all, they’ve shut me out and blatantly ignore me all day (this is just 1 reason, among other factors) and because I have crippling anxiety it has just made it so so SO hard to cope at work. Because of this my managers have misread my anxiousness (despite knowing I have anxiety) for poor progress in my apprenticeship. 2 days after coming back from sick leave, I contracted COVID-19. I then had to have another 2 weeks off. I understand that this is a lot of time to have off work as a new employee (I’m only 4 months in) They have already previously extended my probation to the 3rd of Jan 2021 but now they have emailed me to attend a “formal hearing” this Tuesday, 24th Nov. I am so scared that I’m going to lose this job too. In the meeting I won’t even be able to explain/defend myself as my anxiety makes it so I cannot get any words out of my mouth, it’s like they get stuck in my chest which just leads to me either bawling my eyes out or having a panic attack. I am so depressed lately but this job is not something I can ever give up on. 

All I can think of during this time leading up to the meeting is how exactly I’m going to Kill myself once they sack me. I feel like I’m drowning, my body feels so sick, like it’s on shut down mode. If I lose this job my parents with disown me and I’ll have nowhere to live. I can’t live with that. I don’t want to be alone. Things had the potential to be so good and I messed it up, as usual.

I am afraid,"In the last days, I feel like I'm losing a part of myself. As if the man that I was is slowly fading away, changed by what my mind is trying to create. I get up in the morning under stress, function under stress, go to bed under stress, only thinking about how I can become someone I don't want to be, as if I were forcing myself to do it. As if it were a disease. The only thing that keeps me alive, ironically, is the thought of death. The thought that, no matter what, I can find solace in suicide, it calms me down. I know it is unhealthy, and I am afraid that it is building my way into severe depression. 
I am going through a tough time in my life that has only negative effects on me. I never thought seriously about suicide or planned to commit suicide. I was just thinking about death. 
I'm afraid to be honest. Every day I fear losing my sense of being myself. As I once saw the future for myself, now I see nothing.

Especially if it never fully goes away because apparently depression is something I'll have to deal with my whole life. I'm not exactly thinking of ending my life any day soon, but sooner or later I probably will. Why would I even bother to live if it means I'll feel like this every day? I try to be the best I can be every fucking day but then life decides to fuck me over like that. Seriously, that's just so fucking unfair that life can just decide to fuck you over for just being alive. I can't think of a way all this suffering will pay off, like, there's no way in hell I will find someone who genuinely loves me or a job that will ""fullfil"" me.

"Everyday is becoming more restricted because of COVID, what is the point of life anymore?","This is my first time post here. I have no plan for suicide nor a plan for self harm. That being said, the meaning of life has been festering more and more everyday and I have no support.

All I do is go to work, come to my empty home, be a slave to my phone, then go back to work. Everything I enjoyed is gone. Where I live, we are told what we are allowed to buy, we are not allowed to have visitors. Everyone is in complete fear and I can't take the isolation anymore. They keep saying 2 weeks, then 4 weeks, now 3 more weeks. Get where I'm going?
Now they dangled the vaccine carrot, 90% and 95% effective. It's being critiqued and won't end this shenanigans. I knew that. Therapy is something I started in August, but that's not allowed now. Facetime doesn't cut it for me.

I hate everything,"I’m cynical all the time I’m depressed, I’m a fuck up, I’m a city driven, and I’m self destructive everything that makes me happy I push away. I was so depressed I tried killing myself three times before one with bleach but I threw it up. The next time I was gonna shoot myself in school after a talent show I wasn’t going to cause a school shooting just kill myself  after making people laugh. I used to be addicted to pain killers and tried to OD on them but didn’t have enough left. I was so depressed then I met her. She made me feel so much better, I was always happy with her just talking to her made me feel good. She was everything to me, but I’m self destructive as I said I knew it and I don’t want to push her away. She was everything to me. Then she started talking to another guy. I had heard shit about this guy so I wanted to make sure she wasn’t going to take her from me I know I shouldn’t have worried but my anxiety got the best of me. It built up inside me and consumed my mind until it was all I could think about. I asked of my friends to talk to him, I didn’t care if he was talking to her I just want to know if he liked her. But word got out she found out and made a rash decision and broke up with me. I tried everything to get her back but she wouldn’t listen to me. I was so depressed I started drinking again and going back to pills then one day I tried to end it all again and hang myself. But I didn’t tie it right on the pipe in my garage it fell and I fell crying. I can’t even kill myself right. Idk what to do everything hurts so much I drink to sleep and forget I find it harder to wake up and get out of my bed. I have my friends tell me that it’ll be fine and my future is bright but I don’t believe them everything they say I’ve heard over and over again and now I just feel numb to what they say. I’m afraid that I’ve started to just lose myself my voice tell me to just end it but I can’t EVERYTIME I do I just fail again and again.

i’m curious,"i’m curious why the fuck not a SINGLE SOUL cares about me- but then i realize i don’t give a fuck about myself. so how could i even expect that of anyone?

my only girl friend’s best friend is now out of quarantine, so now she’s always with her. no invites anywhere. constantly being ignored now when i ask to hangout. i guess i just filled in the missing spot while her best friend was in quarantine. now that she’s back, i have no value.

my boyfriend has a history of lusting over others, which has killed my self esteem. my libido is gone too. now i suffer every day with the thought that i’ll never be good enough. not to forget he gaslighted me once. and even though it was only once, it feels like it traumatized me.

my only guy best friend has a new girlfriend who hates me because apparently i’m a threat, so i can’t even hangout or talk to him anymore.

"I know I can make it through this episode, but I’m not sure I want to, or if I should.","I’ve been struggling with suicidal ideation since I was a kid. It’s shaped the way I think and see things, and so has being mentally ill in general. It just circles around and around, and it seems like I keep losing everything that matters to me because of my episodes. I’m so tired of watching my life crumble around me when I can’t keep up anymore. I’m so tired of being a burden to my loved ones.

I’m trying to get professional help, but I can’t afford the therapy I actually need. I can’t confide in my friends about a lot of my problems because certain things should really only be addressed by a professional who knows how to handle potentially dangerous situations. My loved ones don’t deserve to be treated like a free hotline, and they don’t deserve to have to watch me ride this rollercoaster over and over again. I can see it draining and hurting them. 

I know I’m sick. I know it’s not my fault I’m sick. But I also feel like it’s my responsibility to look at this and wonder if I should just remove myself from the equation altogether. Is the grief of losing someone to suicide less than the ongoing grief of watching someone you love struggle to do the simplest of things? Is it less painful than having to hear over and over that they don’t want to live?

When thinking about ending my life..,"I am a survivor of childhood sex trafficking, physical abuse and mental abuse. I am a product of rape. Every day growing up my mother told me I was never meant to be born.

My father beat my mother. My mother left me with her parents when I was three. My sister physically abused me as well. After my grandparents died my mother signed me over to her best friends and I was raped.

I knew by the time I was 5 years old that I had wanted to die. Every day I wake up thinking I want to die.

I’ve also been through 10+ of therapy... 

So many tragic things have happened in my life...

I hear my voice in my head crying. The noise won’t stop and I break down and cry when I’m alone. I’ve given away all my valuables.

My family knows I am a disappointment and I wanna finally end their suffer.,"I am 19 years old, I'm a graphic designer (not a good one) and I draw some time to time. The fact I am a disappointment hit hard when the quarantine started. Everybody had to stay at home and my school suddenly went online. I hate it so much. I can't understand people that do enjoy it, there is absolutely no fun factor in it.

Because of that, I missed a lot of classes and I didn't deliver any homework I had to. My mom always tried her best to see only the best in me and now, seeing her just looking at me sadly... I just fucked up horribly.

I know this will sound funny to many of you, but I wish I could be a youtuber. I have been editing videos since I was like 12 having my hands on Windows Movie Maker. My mom also liked to work in Pinnacle Studios (another editing software), so that gave me inspiration too. Just imagining what I could possibly record makes me inspired a little bit! But my parents would most probably hate it, especially my dad.

My dad was an alcoholic and he was sent 3 time to the madhouse, but they always rejected him, because he wasn't too crazy for that. I was always scared of him and I even am today. Even tho he looks happy, I know for a fact that literally anything can set him on rampage.

I also rejected an offer to go to college, because I was scared it would lead me nowhere and It would be a big waste of time. They wouldn't even put me in anyways, so it doesn't matter anyways.

I've tried talking with many many people on Discord, but whenever I come out with me having a problem, they always say the same thing over and over again:

""My dms are open""

And when I DO come into the dms and start describing what's wrong, they always say:

""Well, hope you'll get better.""

When you hear it firstly, it's nice and warm, but when you hear it repeat all over again, it starts to get frustrating. I can offer help to anybody else, but I cannot help myself. Funny.

I just don't have the motivation to do anything to make my life easier. I know I can just do those simple things to make everything better, but because of the quarantine, I became a lazy potato. I disappointed my family, I disappointed my friends and I mostly disappointed myself.",4Roman4,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jy0v5u/my_family_knows_i_am_a_disappointment_and_i_wanna/,19 year old graphic designer good one draw time time fact disappointment hit hard quarantine started everybody stay home school suddenly went online hate much understand people enjoy absolutely fun factor missed lot class deliver homework mom always tried best see best seeing looking sadly fucked horribly know sound funny many wish could youtuber editing video since wa like 12 hand window movie maker mom also liked work pinnacle studio another editing software gave inspiration imagining could possibly record make inspired little bit parent would probably hate especially dad dad wa alcoholic wa sent 3 time madhouse always rejected crazy wa always scared even today even tho look happy know fact literally anything set rampage also rejected offer go college wa scared would lead nowhere would big waste time even put anyways matter anyways tried talking many many people discord whenever come problem always say thing dm open come dm start describing wrong always say well hope get better hear firstly nice warm hear repeat start get frustrating offer help anybody else cannot help funny motivation anything make life easier know simple thing make everything better quarantine became lazy potato disappointed family disappointed friend mostly disappointed,family know disappointment wanna finally end suffer,4 roman 4,2189,75,4 roman 4 19 year old graphic designer good one draw time time fact disappointment hit hard quarantine started everybody stay home school suddenly went online hate much understand people enjoy absolutely fun factor missed lot class deliver homework mom always tried best see best seeing looking sadly fucked horribly know sound funny many wish could youtuber editing video since wa like 12 hand window movie maker mom also liked work pinnacle studio another editing software gave inspiration imagining could possibly record make inspired little bit parent would probably hate especially dad dad wa alcoholic wa sent 3 time madhouse always rejected crazy wa always scared even today even tho look happy know fact literally anything set rampage also rejected offer go college wa scared would lead nowhere would big waste time even put anyways matter anyways tried talking many many people discord whenever come problem always say thing dm open come dm start describing wrong always say well hope get better hear firstly nice warm hear repeat start get frustrating offer help anybody else cannot help funny motivation anything make life easier know simple thing make everything better quarantine became lazy potato disappointed family disappointed friend mostly disappointed family know disappointment wanna finally end suffer

"28 Years of failure, anxiety and depression.","The title says it all. I’ve been suffering from severe depression and anxiety my entire life. I’ve been on Valium, Xanax, Clonazepam, Ativan, Wellbutrin, and most recently lexapro. My doctor doesn’t believe in benzo drugs, they’re “too addictive” ... but they help me survive and have a semi-normal level of function in my day to day life. She will write me a script for 0.25mg Xanax twice daily which hardly helps. 

I started lexapro a few weeks ago and I’ve had ups and downs, I feel sick to my stomach most days and my nights are plagued with intrusive thoughts... it’s hard to sleep when you lay in bed wanting to die. I’ve always had suicidal thoughts but lexapro is making them worse. 

2020 has been the year of hell for me. Financial failure, horrible dead end job that I can’t escape, my father has congestive heart failure and to top it off, I was diagnosed with a rare medical condition (IIH and papilledema; I’m going blind). I just want to die. I have no desire to live.. my father is the only thing keeping me alive and as soon as he’s gone I’ll join him.

Boy Scout Camp Counselor im going to kill myself at some point this year. Backstabbed,"This is long and I cannot go on with life after being backstabbed and banned from one of my biggest hobbies and the camp I wanted to raise my kids at in the future. I violated a rule of internet contact by talking with scouts over the pandemic to get me through it and one of them reported me after having a mental breakdown when I was blocked after sending way too many messages to apologize and I looked crazy , I kept reaching out to try and do damage control but it just made my situation worse trying to salvage the friendship and staff bond. I am eventually going to kill myslef at the camp now in the new dining hall I will never get to see.

The pandemic is making my situation worse and there is no light at the end of the tunnel even when it ends knowing I can't go back to the place that gave me a purpose. I had sent nothing inappropriate or threatening we just got into a minor argument over a misunderstanding that I took out of context. Now everyone from the camp will think I said something predatory or threatening when not knowing the details and I can't live with my reputation ruined like that when all the scouts looked up to me and staff members respected me. 




I am 27 and was proud of who I was 1-2 months before all this happened.  I destroyed so little in such a short amount of time with the Girl Eagle scout I was going to work with and mentored and I now look like a monster. I shouldn't have been in contact with a 16 year old girl in the first place this was the root of my problem but I saw her as a friend I made at camp and was bringing her up as a staff member as if she was a daughter of my own. I have no kids and teaching the scouts at camp filled the void of not having any of my own. She was willing to sell me her art and was a pretty and kind person to be around. Keeping in touch with everyone from the camp was keeping me going through the covid pandemic . I just wanted one year with us all working together before camp was canceled in 2020.  I ruined it all by bothering her and getting mad over a dumb comment and made it worse by apologizing and reaching out too much until I got reported for internet harassment now I feel like an evil monster when all I wanted to do was save the bond I had with her as a staff member, friend and mentor. 

The camp had saved my life from alcoholism in 2019 and got me into shape from 270lbs to 220 lbs from quitting alcohol and staying active. My own childhood camp from when I was a scout.  I was proud to be part of a huge year in which girls had joined the bsa and was happy to have a future first generation girl eagle scout in my center to be part of history with me and give me a purpose in life. 

Me and the girl Eagle scout were talking online one night and I took a comment she made out of context and got unnecessarily mad that she had said ""ew"" to a dumb story I had told. In a normal mind state I would brush this off. She had apologized and then I became a kiss ass apologizing back and sent 8 messages over the course of 4 hours in one night until I got blocked on IG.

I had panicked and kept messaging her on different platforms that I was suicidal and to please unblock me so we can remain friends. I was hormonally unstable from steroids my personal trainer put me on and was panicking in an anxiety attack. I kept going through the day on different platforms begging for her forgiveness and probably scared her so bad looking back in hindsight and looked like a creepy stalker. I wish I can go back in time and stop this but I can't and feel like death is the next option because it will be all I can think about forever and I will be living in constant pain. 

The worst part about this was she looked up to me a lot and liked me as a person before this emotional meltdown happened. I lost her as a friend forever and ended up getting reported to the camp by her because I couldn't stop bothering her through email after she had called for help when I was suicidal. It took weeks for my hormones to be somewhat normal and out of my system. 

During this time frame I had also lost hours of my job severely due to covid cutbacks lost my dog for 5 days. I found out my sister had been raped too and I can't go back in time to stop myself from messaging the girl when I had such a short fuse and wish I never even responded negatively to her original comment when she said ""ew"" to my story. The steroids made me unable to rationalize this.

Now my brain can think straight again but this is the bad part. All of the emotion of being banned is hitting me and all the memories of camp I had and all the friends I made haunting me in my dreams and nightmars. My reputation is ruined people will think I am a creep or predator when all I wanted to do was salvage the relationship with the girl eagle scout I mentored so she would stay in my center and make me art because she was extremely talented. She will become a popular staff member and knowing I will never be there to witness her success and the fact she hates me and is scared to ever contact me again kills me inside. All of this was preventable within one week. 

I can't go back to the camp or visit when staff is there because what I did makes me a risk. It is a problem enough that the boy scouts organization is being sued for sexual harassment.  I wanted to put my sons and daughters in scouts and have a dynasty at the camp in the future.  Now all of my dreams are stomped out and my reason to live I wanted to be a Ranger there . My purpose in life is gone teaching those kids and knowing how popular I was with them on staff is killing me. I can't even join the military after being potentially suicidal now. I have no way to redeem myself in life. 

I already have bothered some staff about suicide after this happened and they called for help but it doesn't work. They just sit me in a room and have police talk to me and sitting in the room with other mental patients just makes me want to die faster or get out fast so I lie and tell them im not suicidal just so I can get out. Ive been there twice in one week. I am never going back there I will be dead before I ever reach the mental health emergency at the hospital again. 

To make it worse the hospital said to reconcile with whoever sent help yet I was blocked on everything and emailed her a fake report I typed up because I was desperate to save the situation and wanted her to know I was safe at the time. 

I am sorry Victoria and sorry to the Boy scouts organization for making this look so bad and making this more pressure on the Narragansett council and camp Yawgoog.  I can never see her reach eagle or tell her how proud I am because I am blocked from all contact on every platform yet we would talk for months during the pandemic. She hates me now forever and is scared to ever talk to me again because of the meltdown and messages sent. Its about to get worse tho once they find ny dead body and notes and it makes the news. 

I became way too emotionally attached after she decided to paint me a staff hat that I will never get now.  She will also never want to see me again and probably wishes I was dead and I deserve it. I should be dead right now  but the only thing keeping me alive is my parents love and family. 

I want to just kill myself at the camp it was my life and my new identity and it will make the proper gravesite for me. Its where I would feel necessary to do it. I can't ever see the new dining hall they built either with staff and scouts in it. I should just end it because all I can think about is the girl Victoria and the camp and all my friends on staff I will never see again. My dream job as a Ranger there is ruined forever and everyone that finds out that I am banned for obsessively harassing a 16 year girl electronically to try and fix a friendship and staff bond everyone will see it the wrong way. I will just look like a stalker or pedophile or groomer or serial killer. When it wasn't the case at all she was my apprentice and pride to mentor. 


I know for a fact her parents , troop, or council will never reverse the decision to let me teach there ever again. I don't want my friends from camp to know when I plan on committing suicide there at the camp. My life is wrecked completely and reputation is ruined. All the scouts made songs about me and its all ruined from that one week of steroid abuse and being mentally unstable from hearing about my sister being sexually assaulted made me want to kill someone. I wish I never messaged the girl in that mind state. 

I lost my only purpose in life that gave me happiness in life and the summer.  I know therapy will never help this situation.  All I can picture in my head is all of the staff taking their staff pictures and having fun and I will never be there with them again. I also don't even know if I can join another BSA camp or not depending on the level of what was said by the parents and obviously they are overprotective of their daughter who is 16 and contacted a 27 year old. Nobody will know it was in a wholesome way and never meant anything sexual or negative in our chats. I just tried so hard to salvage our friendship and looked like a crazy stalker because the steroids destroyed my mental state.

This would never have even happened if we worked together in 2020 and the pandemic never happened. I felt the need to stay in touch with everyone after our season was canceled so badly. It is why I talked to everyone from camp in the first place even the young scouts and old staff members.  I had nothing else to stay happy about except thinking about the pandemics end and being back together at camp. I wouldn't have even tried bodybuilding steroids either if my trainer didn't recommend them. But I have nothing else to do with low job hours then to physically push myself . 

I just hope they know there will be a time when my body will be found dead in the camp dining hall. Everyone will know how badly I was treated mentally and neglected when I vented emotionally to her and warned that I would become suicidal if I was banned. Im glad to know my emotions meant nothing to her and the camp. I am just disposable despite being one of the best people in my center. I did not have to get reported by her if she just waited the 2 weeks for me to become mentally stable again and rationalized not to bother her. She did not have to block me after pouring out emotion to apologize in our original chat even if it was annoying.  It was not the right thing to do she could've just told me to stop but instead cut off all contact and reported me for trying to reach out and let her know how bad my mental state was . Ruining my whole life in cold hearted way I should just die because I will never stop thinking about her and the camp. I ruined all my friendships in the past with alcoholism and finally had a sober clear outlet and I ruined it my new structure for positivity in my life with new friends. Now I mentally never will recover. 

Everyone from the camp will hate me because eventually she will talk. The decision will never be reversed all her friends from camp will talk and they will make everyone think I am evil just because of a stupid internet overreaction and our age difference. The fact I was on her side and giving her advice to fight real harassment and the staff that physically kept trying to touch the girls never got reported is a spit in the face to me. The worst part about this is I can't even bring myself to hate her because I saw her as if she was a kid of my own. I wanted an artsy type girl to mary or one that was into the outdoors or scouting and its all ruined forever. 

  
All I have is my body that is in good shape and people tell me a lot I am attractive now with all the fat loss and new muscle. It doesn't mean anything tho if im mentally destroyed and can't even function to go to work anymore or even talk to a girl that finds me attractive.  I will die alone with no kids and never have a cute wife with a lot of kids. I will never be able to visit that camp if I put my kids in scouts and its too much to handle. Knowing my dreams got destroyed this badly. I will never recover mentally and be haunted for life looking at all the stuff I have from the camp that I took pride in. All my pictures too mean nothing. All it shows is what I had and now currently lost forever due to my shitty actions by trying steroids for 3 weeks because I asked my trainer for an extra boost at the gym and what drugs would help the best to burn fat and recover my muscles the fastest. This all stemmed from the pandemic closing camp and giving me nothing better to do than use social media and the gym. 

 
Every summer its all ill think about is the camp and how I cannot work there. Knowing I was backstabbed by a 16 year old girl I had the most respect for and she did it over me just reaching out constantly about my mental state hurts so bad when there are actual people at camp that are way worse and physically harass people I had to report them even though she did not want to before in our previous conversations months ago. They are the real enemies to the scouting organization not me. I am just a 27 year old who wanted to stupidly save his staff relationship with a 16 year old girl that I mentored.

I'm ready to go,"37 years and everybody ive known (family, friends, wives, step kids) has left me. I dont blame them, my social anxiety makes me a very awkward and boring person. And every time I try to man up and say ""this is all mental, fight through it"" and go out and try to be normal, I end up being rejected. Im tired.

Im just so so tired. It physically hurts. I have 2 children (6 &amp; 7) who I see half the week. They love me to death and think im awesome, only because they're young and don't realize how fucked up i am yet. I kinda wanna go on this high note. Once they get older they will leave me too, and I dont want to experience that one.

It'll hurt them now, but they are so young I feel they will be better off in the bigger picture. I have nothing to offer them once they get older.

Just wanted to get this off my chest. Anybody ive tried to say this to irl just says im feeling sorry for myself, im selfish, i need to man up and stop being so emotional, etc.

Ive searched and searched and searched again, seems bullet to the head is the easiest most efficient way to get it over with. Im going to enjoy these last holidays with my kids the best I can, and then leave this earth for the new year.

it just seems like my only option,"i've always been suicidal or at least obsessed with the idea of making everything stop since i was still in single digits, what i can remember of that time anyway, trauma blocks out a lot 

the frantic urge has waxed n waned depending on ym life circumstances but most days even on good days or weeks or months i still wake up and my first thoughts are ""fuck. you woke up. aren't you tired? you could just. do it today you know. so easy. and then you never have to wake up again! u won't have to handle everything yourself! there will be nothing to handle!"" but like depression and lonliness n abuse are one thing. u can get help for that you can heal that you can fix that you can push through that. but physical pain and immobility is another for me. i'm kind of sickly and i'm in my mid 20's and it just feels like - actually not just feels. it is. no matter how hard i work on my health and fitness my body seems bent on failing me and honestly i see the potentially vast expanse of my life stretchhing before me and it just gets darker and more painful. i thought once i lost all the weight or once i started really investing in my mental health and healing things would be different. better. 

it's not. i still want to die all the time, and this year has just. calmed the urge, but also solidified it. made me sure it's the right path for me. 

it always felt unfair that i can't just. check out because of obligations to other people. but i'm starting to get over that. my family n friends will be fine you know?  i'm no one's first priority anyway and people r resilient and can recover emotionally from just about anything and so can i. but this is less about my brain and more about my body and i've got to the point where i'm no longer thinking about a lifetime of shoddy pain management and failed rehabilitation and i spend most of my time considering my options for not being here shortly. how to make it as smooth or Sure as possible, how to make sure its not just an attempt. it feels right and it feels inevitable and it feels. comforting. 

i can't wait to not suffer, honestly. mentally, physically, emotionally. all of it. 

i don't know. i don't feel panicked anymore, i only feel panicked when i think about. being here. having to ccontinue to be here. now i feel like, okay. what's another little while of pain for an endless expanse of peace right? i don't know. i know how it sounds and i know how upset i would be if someone i loved just wanted to end it but i feel like. i'd also be happy for them? i'm not sure. probably not. maybe i would just want people to be happy for me. that i'm finally doing the only thing ive ever wanted to do. rest.

"I feel like a manipulative and abusive person, I pressured my ex to come back because of my own selfish desires. I don't want this to ruin my reputation in the future, and I can't find any other way out.","My first relationship ever was when I was 13, and the girl that I was dating was also 13. Early, I know, but everyone in our school was beginning to date at that age. We were a very happy couple, we kissed and cuddled, and we told each other how much we loved each other and gave each other gifts. I thought everything was going great. But all good things come to an end, and she wanted to break up with me.

The reason for this was because she felt that I was too good for her. And I disagreed with this as much as possible, because it wasn't true at all (I've had a very low self-esteem for as long as I could remember). She ended up breaking up with me, but I still didn't give up. I thought, that if I just kept asking her to come back to me, she would, and then we could be happy again, and do all the things we did before. I missed seeing her. So that's what I did. I kept asking over and over for her to come over because I deeply missed her. She didn't want to get back together, but eventually, she agreed.

Unfortunately, the relationship was beyond repair in both our eyes. We broke up, again, and we didn't talk to each other for several years.

Now, I realise what I had done, I kept begging for her to come back because of my own selfish desires, and she didn't want to. In the end, I made her give in to coming back to me, being blind to the fact that she didn't want to be in a relationship with me anymore, and yet I made her come back to me. And I feel absolutely terrible now for doing such a thing. The guilt I feel every day for the last couple of months is overwhelming.

Fast forward to 2020, I am now 16. I finally talked to her for the first time in 3 years, and I apologised for everything, and I told her that I had changed from the desperate, selfish kid I once was. She was a bit confused as to why I was apologising, but accepted it anyway.

I'm not sure if she has forgiven me, or if she was mad with me in the first place. Maybe she's forgotten what happened, and she'll remember it one day and realise all the dumb mistakes I made. I'm pretty terrified about how my past will affect my future, and especially if what I was doing was pressuring her to come back to me, and so we could kiss and cuddle again, how that would affect the rest of my life and my mental health.

I just don't know how to get rid of the guilt I feel every day. It was a long time ago, but I remember it like it was yesterday. Am I just overthinking things? Or is this a reasonable thing to worry about?

TL;DR I pressured my ex to come back, we did, and it didn't work out, but I think we are still on good terms with each other, but now I feel guilt. I feel like a manipulative person, who pressured my ex into doing things she didn't want to do, and I didn't know better. Is this something I should worry about for my future?

Hi,"I hope this helps anyone going through hard times. About 20 years ago we were on our way to my wife's friend's birthday party.  My wife and I had separated before and I feared it would happen again. So, she was driving, we were arguing, I was drunk and high and I knew the direction everything was headed. I jumped out of the vehicle which was traveling around 55- 60 mph attempting to end my life. To my udder disappointment upon waking up in the hospital,  I hear the nurse say"" he's awake"". My wife enters the room and says to me "" I'm leaving you and we are getting a divorce "". She turned around and walked away. I am now 51 years old. I have been married twice have two offspring from each marriage. I am basically homeless and don't have anyplace to stay after this upcoming new year 2021. I talk to my youngest daughter everyday,  she is the only one that talks to me anymore.  Out of all the things I have been through , I think I am ok. I deal with my life day by day, don't expect anything from anyone and just try to be a good person(whatever that is). I have a lot of things to say but feel l've said enough for now .

The holidays.,"The last time I ever thought about killing myself was around the 5th grade. It was an option I now wish I never looked towards, but it’s coming back. This year was different. I expected the holidays this year to be joyful and exciting, but it’s the exact opposite. I’ve had 2 close relatives die. One was from covid. The other was a scenario I thought couldn’t touch me. I have a fucked up side of the family, the relatives with sinister minds. My poor uncle who we thought died from covid, actually drank himself to death. This was weeks ago too, I don’t know why it’s hitting me now. The thought of killing myself gives me an odd comfortable feeling. It’s more that I don’t want to exist than to kill my self. I apologize if this breaks the rules, I’m just needed to get it all out, don’t know why exactly I came here.

I was going to use that money to fund my business but that had to be taken away too because my parents are now door dashing. Because both of my parents having jobs apparently isn’t paying the bills

It’s because most of that money is going to my mom’s non profit organization. It wouldn’t even be a problem if it didn’t affect our lives but it does. She always pays the phone bill late, we have resorted to free school food to survive

Then she’ll complain about us never having enough money for anything and blaming everyone else but herself. If you’re going to invest that kind of money into a business you don’t GET to complain about being broke. That’s what my starter pack meme was making fun of. People like her

I’m broke because of her incompetence. Not my laziness. I had ways of making money but she had to fucking take it all away

Literally no escape from brain,"This is a really, really, really, really long one...

I’ve always not been great mentally, tried to commit suicide several times before (mostly pills or at bad times blood loss/ or more simply tried to off myself with a coke overdose). this went on for maybe 10 years (since teens). stuff then happened that maybe ‘warranted/validated’ how i felt (i don’t mean to diminish anyone else’s feelings - just ‘warranted’ in my head). 

i ended up in a horrible relationship because i wanted to help my (sort of) girlfriend through her brother committing suicide. she gave me a black eye at that time - and i excused it - and we somehow ended up married, despite that abusive behaviour not changing. lost my nan (complications from regular surgery), mum - from cancer- in the space of a month. my mother in law (who was the gentlest most caring person i’ve ever known -and helped my wife be less abusive) then died. i miss them all so fucking much. after years i finally had the sense to push for divorce.

i switched antidepressants, but then i fell/had a first time seizure (possibly because of the new antidepressants). 

from that i had a brain haemorrhage. i lost most of my hearing (playing music/band/playing in shitty gritty clubs etc. was everything to me). it made me lose my sense of smell/taste (i loved food and cooking), and my brain just isn’t what it was. aside from music, then only thing that made me feel useful was writing, or joking. now i can’t spell, or read well. or find words easily. i get stuck part way through a joke that makes people laugh at me because i scramble for the wrong words and that’s funny in itself. from the head injury i’ve developed epilepsy, and have had seizures that have landed me in hospital.

i get so dizzy and nauseous that i can’t leave bed sometimes. or even get down the stairs. i get frequent night terrors. i’ve not been without a headache since three, nearly four years ago from the head injury. three years with a headache, a headache so bad it makes me want to smash my face into a wall, genuinely, and i mean this literally - there’s nothing else i can do with the pain - despite of every sensible pain treatment. i can’t take the pain. 

i was supposed to stop over at my childhood home from the divorce (got married very early 20s, with previously mentioned older woman - was supposed to just stop over till i found another place - before the haemorrhage). now i’m stuck in my childhood bedroom, incapable of doing anything, not being able to contribute anything. 

i can’t leave, i  can’t sleep, i can’t taste, i can’t smell, i can’t hear well, i struggle to understand words and conversation. and i always.have.an.excruciating.headache. 

the night terrors make sleep, which should be a rest, awful. but i can’t help it. i fall asleep part way through work (in a job i’m blagging, because it takes me so long to understand what i’m reading/hearing). i wake up, at my desk, feeling fucking terrified. and then having to push through the day (i’m lucky enough to be working from home).

i don’t feel like i can do it. i genuinely wish a seizure would take me out. that way no-one will feel responsible. i take my cocktail of epilepsy/pain meds four times a day. and every time think, what if i miss this one. what if i skip a day. this time will i stop breathing indefinitely, instead of having paramedics round to inject me and put a mask on. my dad said the reason my brother got sectioned (psychotic depression) was because that seizure kept him up all night.

depressingly, these paragraphs took me so long to write. i’ve had to look up spelling after spelling. this has literally taken over 2 hours to write.

it doesn’t even feel real. i don’t even feel real. i’m leaning on tablets i don’t want. leeching off people that shouldn’t have to accommodate someone that can barely formulate a sentence in real time. 

i’m completely lost. mentally, physically. what is it to be a person that can’t mentally or physically function. 

the pain specialist told me after x-many years this pain isn’t going. what can i do? what is there to do? i’m stuck, in every sense of the word. 

if you’ve got all the way down this far you’re a fucking trouper lol. i know everyone’s struggling. i know there are so many people with much, much, much more to grapple with. you all make me feel very proud.",biscuitofremorse,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jy1ska/literally_no_escape_from_brain/,really really really really long one always great mentally tried commit suicide

"""I'm fine""","I'm so sick of saying this over and over again. I sit in bed writing Suicide notes while messaging my best friend and saying that stupid phrase ""I'm fine"".

I'm so sick of people believing that just because they don't want to have to deal with the idea that someone isn't fine. I wish someone would just say to me. I know your not fine or tell me I'm lying. I know the answer to this question is not to say I'm fine but if I start saying how rubbish I'm feeling all the time then I'm being dramatic and making it up because ""no one is miserable all the time"".

I don't have the guts to end it all.,"Life is absolute hell. I hate it here. I don't have any reason to, I have a nice family I guess, and more than most people could ask for. When I think of that, it just makes me feel guilty for not having enough dopamine to function properly.

I've struggled with on and off self harm since 9th grade. Of course, my parents found out, it became a big deal, I found more discrete ways to do it. (Few burns to the thighs do the magic.)

I hate everything in my life. I feel so tied down, so horrible. I struggle with PCOD, and its entire package deal; I'm overweight and ugly, hirsutism is a freaking pain, medications work only to become useless 2 months later. I'll probably get diabetes in my 30s (given I survive till then lmao) cause it runs in my family too. Oh, and I'm 17. I hate high school stress. I used to be smart and nowadays no matter how hard I try I'm just not smart enough to make my Asian parents proud of me. I just can't anymore and I want to give up and run away from life. My parents expect so much from me (in a good way) and they feel like I have so much potential. And I feel so guilty for letting them down every single time and I don't even want to face them anymore. I feel so so guilty that I have tears running down my face as I write this.

What's weird is there's times when I feel okay. Not extremely happy, just okay and dissociated from my pain, for a good 2-3 days. Then the tinniest of triggers rips my entire emotions open and I'm back to searching up ""Painless ways to die"" (No, I don't want to contact suicide helplines, thanks). I've tried twice but I was too scared to actually just get it over with. I have an overwhelming fear of failure even when it comes to ending my life, apparently.

There's only two things that keeps me from actually just getting it done with.

1. I'm scared I'll screw up so bad that I'll end up alive and handicapped. And that is something I absolutely fear, because I'm a dancer. And dancing is the one thing that also keeps me going everyday. Jumping from a building only to screw my spinal cords and become a handicap is an everyday nightmare. Imagine not dancing for the rest of my life. No thanks, I'd rather die.
2. I have a 5 year old brother. And I love him so much that my heart feels full every time I see him. Yes, he pisses me off sometimes, but he loves me so much and the thought of leaving him just breaks me. He's literally my only anchor. The one person that I can't leave behind. I just can't, I love him so so much. I'm always in a dilemna cause I don't want to be selfish and leave him, but I just want to be selfish for myself and end the pain of life for once and for all.

I’m confused,"I’m so confused. I don’t know how I feel or what I feel or even if it’s valid. Ever since I found out my Mom suffered with alcoholism (and secretly still smokes even after getting sober from alcohol) and she went to rehab for 4 months around 2016 I’ve felt so alone and lost and I really don’t know why. It didn’t really have an emotional impact on me any different than the rest of my family but that’s just the time I remember things changing. I used to be “gifted student” and after that I stopped doing homework or assignments and started falling behind a lot. I feel like I burnt out and my parents don’t seem to understand. They still expect me to be this star student that I’m not and none of them have realized somethings wrong. I hate going out or leaving my room at all and recently i’ve been losing the urge to eat at all. I don’t know what’s wrong with me but I also feel so invalid for feeling this way, like I feel like somehow i’m just doing this all for attention and that there’s actually nothing wrong w me. I’m so confused on what is happening to me and more and more i’ve turned to unhealthy coping mechanisms for whatever i’m coping with. I don’t like eating and I get super nauseous all the time and frequent headaches. Doing things and going out makes me anxious and I never have the energy to do it. I have no motivation for school or anything and I just want someone to tell my why I feel like this or if it’s even valid.

going to bed every night hoping it'll be the last, waking up and realizing im still there.

The mountain I made is too hard to climb,"I've been back and forth telling myself not to post here because it's not going to help. But I always get the urge like I have to say something anywhere that doesn't worry my friends.

I'm 29 and I haven't done anything. I feel stuck I'm still working my first job ever for nearly 10 years now and I absolutely hate it. I've been at this gas station gig for so long it only feels worse yet I'm too scared to do anything about it. At the same time I just don't care. Every time I get some sort of shred of drive or motivation to do something with my life it never lasts. I always get too tired and frustrated and my unnatural fears take control I quickly give up. I avoid people like the plague never looking them in the eye. I don't want to be a bother to people and I don't want anyone bothering me. I feel like when people glance at me I feel judged on the spot. I say to myself I know I look like a girl but stop staring damn it I'm not looking at you! I know I'm socially awkward it's really hard for me to speak clearly without nearly screaming it out. I can't hold a conversation I try to end it asap. People have a hard time understanding me and I hate it. I'm becoming a worse person overall. I'd like to think my kindness and patience toward others was my best strength. I don't feel that anymore. I used to do house chores regularly and come to work early. Now my place is a mess with dirty floors dusty shelves and sink filled with dishes. I'm late for work everyday now. Everything feels like a massive undertaking an annoying chore I wait until I absolutely have to do it. I had therapy for a very short time last year but like everything I'm excited about the fear took over and I stopped. Not to mention how expensive it was. Honestly I could afford it but I'm so irresponsible with my money these past couple years I can't afford any of my needs. I have a toxic relationship with my boyfriend but I can't leave. I don't have a driver's license as driving terrifies me. I tried taking classes for college but felt too stupid to go through with it. Just about the only thing that keeps me going are video games and magical girl anime. I used to enjoy those things but now I just use them to distract me from my constant suicidal thoughts. I'm stuck I don't know what to do. I think about all the things I want to fix but the ammount of work required to do that is overwhelming it feels impossible. I know I put all these problems on myself it's all my fault. So I just say I deserve to feel this way. My inaction my laziness my fear throughout my life brought me here. I should have seen it coming. I let my problems pile up to the imaginary mountain that lays before me. I can't see the peak it's so big. As soon as I try to climb I slide back to the bottom. I'm so tired I'm so scared and it's all my fault. I feel all these negative emotions and beat myself up and I don't care.

Wish I was dead,"Not sure what on earth I'm hoping for, just need to vent really. 

I should be relieved and happy about my life, a work matter that was hanging over me was recently resolved, but I still feel anxious and sad, a constant feeling that something terrible is going to happen. Every time I hear some bad news, whether that's a patient at the hospital I work at getting very ill or dying or someone I know losing their job, I get tearful and it's embarrassing for me and others. I get angry too, sometimes about small things, I try to be calm but sometimes it spills out, like I find myself giving someone a dirty look when their back is turned or a harsh tone of voice, it scares me when I do this and I know it upsets others. Tried counselling, it was no help at all, just questions I didn’t have answers for. A psychologist from work diagnosed me with ASD which explains a lot about me (no idea about tone and volume of voice and how to express myself, absolutely no social skills). 

At 23 I'm still living at home with my parents. I dropped out of University after one year of a Nursing degree and they've never really forgiven me (rightly so, it was due to laziness on my part). Now I work a mediocre housekeeping job at a local hospital and they don't hide that I've been a disappointment to them. 

I self harm and have for years, in the last few months it's gotten very bad, my parents have noticed and my mother has gone ballistic about it. Now she insists on checking my arms and shouts when my older scars and cuts haven't healed and faded. It makes me so angry and sad and I don't know what to do. I'm not trying to be awkward or attention seeking but that's how it seems to others. My father tries to help, he notices when I'm upset and tries to comfort me but he's getting fed up with me and he has enough to worry about without a mental daughter too, his job is quite precarious right now and he thinks he will be sacked soon. My mother has a lot of health problems to deal with, and I know I'm just adding to their pain and stress. They've both tried to be understanding and supportive but I think I've exhausted their patience. They are good people who deserve better than a crazy selfish daughter who cries at everything and can't do anything right. 

I really do think everyone would be better off if I was dead. One less thing to worry about for my family. I have no friends to speak of and my colleagues would hardly notice my absence. A long time ago I accepted that I'd die by suicide, that it was just a matter of when, perhaps I should just hurry up and get it over with before I hurt those I love more than I already have.",northernskyatdawn,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxyp14/wish_i_was_dead/,sure earth hoping need vent really relieved happy life work matter wa hanging wa recently resolved still feel anxious sad constant feeling something terrible going happen every time hear bad news whether patient hospital work getting ill dying someone know losing job get tearful embarrassing others get angry sometimes small thing try calm sometimes spill like find giving someone dirty look back turned harsh tone voice scare know upset others tried counselling wa help question answer psychologist work diagnosed asd explains lot idea tone volume voice express absolutely social skill 23 still living home parent dropped university one year nursing degree never really forgiven rightly wa due laziness part work mediocre housekeeping job local hospital hide disappointment self harm year last month gotten bad parent noticed mother ha gone ballistic insists checking arm shout older scar cut healed faded make angry sad know trying awkward attention seeking seems others father try help notice upset try comfort getting fed ha enough worry without mental daughter job quite precarious right think sacked soon mother ha lot health problem deal know adding pain stress tried understanding supportive think exhausted patience good people deserve better crazy selfish daughter cry everything anything right really think everyone would better wa dead one le thing worry family friend speak colleague would hardly notice absence long time ago accepted die suicide wa matter perhaps hurry get hurt love already,wish wa dead,northern sky dawn,2643,15,northern sky dawn sure earth hoping need vent really relieved happy life work matter wa hanging wa recently resolved still feel anxious sad constant feeling something terrible going happen every time hear bad news whether patient hospital work getting ill dying someone know losing job get tearful embarrassing others get angry sometimes small thing try calm sometimes spill like find giving someone dirty look back turned harsh tone voice scare know upset others tried counselling wa help question answer psychologist work diagnosed asd explains lot idea tone volume voice express absolutely social skill 23 still living home parent dropped university one year nursing degree never really forgiven rightly wa due laziness part work mediocre housekeeping job local hospital hide disappointment self harm year last month gotten bad parent noticed mother ha gone ballistic insists checking arm shout older scar cut healed faded make angry sad know trying awkward attention seeking seems others father try help notice upset try comfort getting fed ha enough worry without mental daughter job quite precarious right think sacked soon mother ha lot health problem deal know adding pain stress tried understanding supportive think exhausted patience good people deserve better crazy selfish daughter cry everything anything right really think everyone would better wa dead one le thing worry family friend speak colleague would hardly notice absence long time ago accepted die suicide wa matter perhaps hurry get hurt love already wish wa dead

I can’t stop thinking about it,"I have, objectively, a very good life. A loving spouse, a close family, good friends, a stable job, some savings, a warm home and a sweet cat. I know my life is good and I should be happy. 

But so often lately all I can think of is ending it all. I go for walks and question whether buildings would be high enough to jump off of. I look at pills at the drugstore and in my medicine cabinet and wonder if it would be enough, all together, taken with some alcohol maybe. I prep dinner and stare at the sharp knife in my hands and the thin pale skin of my wrists. 

My family would be upset. My spouse too, although he would find someone else - someone better than me, thinner, more kind and patient, more intelligent. He would take care of our cat and she would forget about me in time. My job would find someone else easily, and someone who is actually qualified and knows what they’re doing and gives a shit about the work. My friends would go on without me, living their lives and growing and being successful. 

I feel like I’m just floating through life sometimes, like nothing I do matters and that I provide no worth to anyone or anything. What’s even the point? I’ve been feeling this way for 17 years and while it’s waxed and waned it’s never really gone away.

"I seriously want to end it all, but im fucking terrified","Hi everyone, im a 22 year old soldier, a lone child to a single mother, living with her, and it's fucking unbearable, but the funny thing is that I seriously don't know what to do because I'm afraid my manipulative mom would royally screw me over. She is fucking toxic waste. Our current fight started about 2 hours ago, and now I've decided ""fuck it, I need to move out"" but I can't make myself pack my bags, and im just lying on my bed crying like a baby. I seriously feel like I have regressed a few years in my mental state. Heck, she even told me: ""not a single day after your discharge you'll stay here in this house"" but honestly, she keeps trying to get me in line even after all of the shit has resurfaced (again 😒). She always makes it seems like she's being attacked and she's the complete victim in this whole story (I've had a serious breakdown a while ago because of her, crying and yelling my lungs out,
 and I even threw stuff at her). Heck, she's been giving me so much shit in my life, and that happened almost every time because I either said something out of line and it blew up. When I told her I was going to therapy through the army she completely lost it, even more so when she found out I got anti-anxiety medications. Only half an hour ago she told me that she'd take me to court, to get back all of the money she ever put for me in a savings account ever since I was born, and of course she'll want more as compensation. I seriously want to go to my office in my base, take a rifle and unload a mag into my brains on full auto, but im also terrified. There were a few times where I almost attempted suicide, but there was a tiny voice in my head telling me: ""don't do it! Please! There are good things waiting for you!""
A few of my colleagues joked about the idea that ""i need to get myself a girlfriend"" but yeah, that's the hardest thing I've ever tried to achieve in my life. I'm a fucking huge screw-up, because I completely blew my chance at getting a girlfriend once, I don't know how to be a completely independent person, add in a huge case of social anxiety and depression to taste, and you got a big, steaming bowl of shit that is my life.
I wish some of my colleagues would, idk...try to properly listen to me, or at least show the slightest interest in how im doing. That small of a thing would honestly brighten my whole outlook on life, but it's too much to hope for...even my closest friend, who honestly is being more and more distant nowadays, isn't showing any signs he wants to help me, and to top it all off, I just feel like I can't explain what I'm going through to anyone to the fullest extent, and that's if I got the courage to talk to someone about it.

"Overwhelmed, Tired, and Alone","Majority of my life has been focused on work. Despite working very hard, being reliable, polite, and doing everything I'm supposed to, it's very clear my boss is getting ready to fire me because I am not overly extroverted with coworkers and don't take ""risks."" If I lose my job, I have no one. No family left, no close friends, completely alone in this world like always. I probably wouldn't qualify for unemployment since it has nothing to do with the pandemic and even though I haven't actually done anything wrong. I know people get laid off all the time but I worry how it will affect my reputation.

I've been thinking about suicide for years now. I've tried meditating, journaling, going for a walk, listening to music, trying to take things one day at a time despite severe anxiety and depression (even though employed for now, never been able to afford therapy or medication with the poor excuse of an insurance). I've tried lots of things to get rid of these thoughts but I'm losing the inner will and energy to push it away.

My life just feels like I'm hopping from one crisis to another. I'm exhausted and can't see any alternative to living a life solely on trying to make just enough money to keep a roof over my head, pay bills, and buy groceries - rinse and repeat - and for what? What is the point of all this tiring effort? I really try to practice gratitude and be patient with myself. I have no idea how I'll commit as I have a very low threshold for pain but all I really want is some peace. I've also considered the ""exit bag"" method but it looks incredibly complicated and I wouldn't know how to find the right parts that fit together, where to get the gas, etc. - even that is overwhelming. 

My anxiety is literally killing me from the inside out. And I've even though about giving myself a deadline like if I can't find a new job by the end of this year, I should just go through with it like ripping a band-aid. It wouldn't be selfish because I have no living family that would be hurt by it, no kids, no partner - I don't even have a pet that relies on me to take care of them. Nobody would be affected by my death. No one.

Tonight, I can barely keep any food down. That's how lost, overwhelmed, and hopeless I feel.

I admit defeat.,"I can't do this anymore. Today was wrapped up in either being screamed at by my mother or sleeping to recover from the trauma of the day. I keep trying far too hard to fight back and protect myself in a battle that's impossible to win. I can't stay and I can't leave, because I'll probably bring the 'rona back and kill my high risk parents. If I had the money to leave I mean.

A separate but relevant issue: I used to think my ideas made me special, but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that they don't. No one wants to hear what I have to say anymore. Why can't I stop speaking like they want me to? Life would be so much more livable if I could drift through silently and never feel compelled to react.

It's all I can do to keep from taking every single pill I have downstairs and bidding my brain children good night. The characters in my head are the only things keeping me alive right now. I suppose I'll have to apologize to them as I take them to my grave.

I'm so broken. I can't do this anymore. I want to be free of this horrible place I'm in. If I could stop feeling and expressing emotions, that would help too.

In deep pain,"Posting here because I have insestant thoughts of suicide. Things like gutting my self with a knife, slitting my own throat, buying a gun then blowing my brains out, or slamming my car into oncoming traffic, plague my mind day to day. I don't want to do these things, but I also can't cope with my life right now and would rather be dead. However, I have strong moral reasons to not go that route, yet the thoughts do not cease and more, or less, mock me.

Recently, I lost my savings of 60,000$ by a mistake of my own. It was the most money I ever had. I had quit my job and began to lease a house. Now I can't afford to continue the lease without a job. I recently just failed a drug test and need to do recovery to get my job back. 

What's worse is I am 30 years old and have always wanted a career in music. I struggle with anxiety when it comes to my creative work and have been paralized to make anything new. I feel time slipping for me and I fear my dream will never come true. I feel that 30 years old is too late to be a successful artist. That money I was hoping to use for my music, like videos and the like, but now I am set back even further. It could take me a year or more of grueling hard work to get back to where I was. My profession outside of my dream of making music is trucking, hence the drug test failure.

I just can't deal with knowing I will never see that money again, right now.

I have little motivation to start from zero again, and I also can't bear to be where I am now. It's just pain and pain. 

Not to mention a myriad of other things that have added up over time, that I am not comfortable to speak up about.

I don't know what anyone can say to ease my suffering and I know no one will make any of this go away.

I will say I am taking SSRI's from a mental health professional. She tells me to try and think positive,  but I only see a dark cloud above me.

I am lucky to have supportive friends and they know my situation,  but I feel like a burden when I reach out to them and I don't always get the understanding that I feel I need.

I feel so hopeless,"Hello, I guess this is my attempt at a lifeline or something.

Okay, so I guess the best way to begin this is to just tell you straight up that I’m gay. This wouldn’t be an issue if I didn’t have strictly conservative parents, I know a lot of people have it worse off than me, but I feel like most of my problems stem from this.

I haven’t been diagnosed as anything really, but I don’t really care because it doesn’t take a fucking expert’s opinion to tell you there is something genuinely fucking wrong with me. Lately I’ve been feeling more and more suicidal, and have been planning my suicide more and more and how I could enact it with little to no effort whatsoever. And right before the time of this post in fact, I’ve cut myself for the first time. Very shallow cuts, 7 of them. Worst part of it was trying to get the bleeding to stop, even now.  That and I’ve been feeling like absolute SHIT consistently for 4 months now, so yeah there’s definitely something wrong.

To further go into detail about the cutting, looking back at it, I snapped and started cutting, going deeper than anything I’ve tried to cut and with such force and pressure. I’m glad there was only an exacto knife nearby, if anything else I think I may have bled out. What scares me about this is 1. how I snapped and started cutting myself and how fast I went to cut myself and 2. How the fuck I’m going to hide the cuts and if someone asks what excuse I could possibly come up with.

At the time of typing this, yesterday during work I was so miserable that I contemplated walking out climbing up a tree, tying my hoodie sleeves on both the tree and my next and just letting myself fall. I obviously didn’t do this, and even if I were to walk out, I’d probably wouldn’t because I felt like if I did, I’d just spread my suffering to my family. 

About my family : As I stated previously, they’re an adamant religious bunch, and they have no tolerance for gays, heresy and mental illness, so I have to act as if I were something I were not around them, and I think the facade is taking a toll on my mind because then I feel like I have no actual personality and that I just have to be fake around people to make them happy at the time. I’ll be honest, it’s hard sometimes but I feel no sense of “selfness” I have never EVER even gave them a hint that I would ever be gay, I try to make it seem like gay isn’t even a comprehensible subject and that it is something so outlandish it shouldn’t exist. However, recently I have told my mother that I am feeling anxious about everything, stressed over tiny things and that I’m feeling like absolute shit and I’ve been considering suicide and she just yells at me and tells me I’m lazy and that even I couldn’t amount to anything if I gave it all of my willpower, and what hurts more than the words is the expectation being shattered. I just want someone to understand me, and to love me for what I am, and genuinely acknowledge that there is something wrong with me, and that I need help, but it just makes me so fucking sad that it’s never going to happen, I don’t even tell this sort of stuff to my one friend because it just ruins the atmosphere and brings the mood down, so I can’t just do that. I feel like I genuinely have nobody, I feel so isolated and alone. I know there are those who have it so much worse off than me, and I try to rationalize the situation in consideration of the fact, but I can’t help but feeling so fucking bad.

I am scared that I’m going to kill myself soon, I just want things to stop being shit, I’ve been feeling like this on and off for almost 5
Years no, but in the past 4 months, I genuinely have been feeling this way daily and very recently have had only suicide on my mind.

To think that people used to tell me I had a bright future.,"I keep on mentally flipping back the pages of my memory. To the times when I still retained my childhood innocence and had hope that things would turn out alright. How people would praise me so: how excellent of a student I was, how kind of a person I was, how successful my future self would become... If only they could see the failure I am now. 

Even though I've lost touch with many of the people back then, I can still envision the faces they'd give me. Mostly of disappointment, some of a condescending pity that wordlessly tells me, ""at least I'm not you."" I know they wouldn't do that. But my brain still taunts me with my own imagination. 

It's sickening. I'm so pathetic. I should be grateful that I'm better off than most despite the pandemic and the many troubles the world is facing right now, shouldn't I? Yet I'm still failing classes that were once easy to me, I'm still becoming bitter and envious of the rightful successes of my hard-working friends, I'm still biting my lip at the family I have that does not understand. I'm still suicidal.

They say that a classic god blesses those who regard them highly and reckons those who blaspheme them. But then, what exactly have I done to you, God? Is my mistake of an existence too great of a sin to you that you've teased me with this bright childhood only to rid me of such blessings the moment you've seen it fit? Or am I simply fulfilling a self-fulfilled prophecy, too stupid and too slothful to make lemonade out of air? The words that were once praises from others feel so silly now.",[deleted],0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jy4lpo/to_think_that_people_used_to_tell_me_i_had_a/,keep mentally flipping back page memory time still retained childhood innocence hope thing would turn alright people would praise excellent student wa kind person wa successful future self would become could see failure even though lost touch many people back still envision face give mostly disappointment condescending pity wordlessly tell least know brain still taunt imagination sickening pathetic grateful better despite pandemic many trouble world facing right yet still failing class easy still becoming bitter envious rightful success hard working friend still biting lip family doe understand still suicidal say classic god blesses regard highly reckons blaspheme exactly done god mistake existence great sin teased bright childhood rid blessing moment seen fit simply fulfilling self fulfilled prophecy stupid slothful make lemonade air word praise others feel silly,think people used tell bright future,deleted,1556,59,deleted keep mentally flipping back page memory time still retained childhood innocence hope thing would turn alright people would praise excellent student wa kind person wa successful future self would become could see failure even though lost touch many people back still envision face give mostly disappointment condescending pity wordlessly tell least know brain still taunt imagination sickening pathetic grateful better despite pandemic many trouble world facing right yet still failing class easy still becoming bitter envious rightful success hard working friend still biting lip family doe understand still suicidal say classic god blesses regard highly reckons blaspheme exactly done god mistake existence great sin teased bright childhood rid blessing moment seen fit simply fulfilling self fulfilled prophecy stupid slothful make lemonade air word praise others feel silly think people used tell bright future
"Wanting to be popular but also being afraid of apps like twitter, also wanting to *** my self","I am not trying to be edgy, but express my feelings, I see reddit as a journal of sorts, even though I encounter childish people on here who do not help me at all.

Twitter is hell and everyone is canceling everyone for many reasons, you are also open to attacks but like you can't be successful blogger and freelancer if you do not have at least a few social medias, If I ever write books fans would most likely get to know me and follow me and some youtubers say that in this age you can't write and not have a profile of some sort

I do not know if this want for fame is cause I was unpopular and uncool for being real and hating shallow things? I can't be sure, but I also hate fights, drama and conflicts, I just want to post what is in my mind and the fact that there would be always trolls and offended people annoys me, it is not like i won't start, i am just afraid it would ruin my future career. I won't post anything political or controvertial most likely but I have seen people get angry at people who just post cute animals on their profile, I know I can't please everyone but do not like to deal with people in general, this is why i want to become a hermit but can't be socially successful without connections and talking to people (which I hate since they reject me even though I am kind and loyal and honest and if they reject me then I will reject everyone and just iolate my self and maybe even k\*\* my self)

OOF

I know I am too much of a coward to do it but maybe it would grant me peace since most days I am mostly crying and even if i watch comedy, buy my self face masks, spend time with a pet I do not feel happier and just wallow more into self pity. What is keeping me sane is my books since the bullies and the popular people took out my only safe heaven (Anime, japanese language) and now i no longer feel happy and good watching, I used to feel proud when I met other anime fans but now it became so mainstream that even bad people watch it. I still love it, my accounts have anime avatar or a meme one, but do not like it when the most shallow people with no morals I know talk about roleplaying and anime when they have social lives and friends unlike and have resources that I can't have cause I was bullied and no one wants to be associtated with the bullied child and it is easier for me to be a victim and suffer as long as it is not someone else.

i feel like it’s the right thing to do.,"i know it’s apparent that, “suicide is not the answer,” but, i really feel like it is. everyone i have ever been in a relationship with, has gotten tired of me because i am constantly complaining and being negative. which, i don’t blame them. i am tired of myself too. i can’t find it in me to help myself. i don’t even know why, because i wanted to get better so bad, all the time. yet, i would give up so easy. i would let it happen. for a variety of reasons, i just never would. i didn’t even know why half the time. i think it was a comfort for me, because it’s the one thing that never left me. but, my boyfriend as of now has lost his patience with me, which im not surprised. he got angry at me and just went off on me about how i don’t try and it’s pretty much my fault, stuff like that. which, i know it is, but it just hurt to be talked to like that i guess. he could’ve said it differently i think. i don’t know. i was thinking that it was my fault, but now i know it is for sure. i know that if i keep myself alive, the same cycle will occur. i just need to end it. it is for the better of everyone. no one has to hear me complain ever again. i don’t have to deal with myself anymore. everything will be so much better. sure, everyone will be sad or whatever, but life goes on, you know. they will eventually have to return to normal life, without me. and they might not realize it, but it will be so much better, like a weight has been lifted off of them. i already wrote my note. i just have to wait until 2 am.

I really struggle to find a place in my heart for what happened... I don't want to be me...,"I had a mental breakdown a year ago. I used to smoke way too much weed and cigarettes and I ate extremely unhealthy too for 9 years. On top of that I had just lived life without thinking clearly and just lived in the moment. I became suicidal. My mind was set on killing myself. 

Then I contact my ex who I dumped and she blocked me. In some random, dumb, depressed, idiotic, life-ruining impulse I made a new account and wrote extremely suicidal texts to her. She said she had improved a lot and I said. 'Fuck improving. I'm done with life. Pointless bullshit anyway. You still want my cat?'...

After that she got angry. I start to explain it. She engages, but then blocks me. This happens like 8 times. After a while she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards'. Then I reply that I did change because I hit the gym 6 times per week, eat extremely healthy, quit smoking, graduated and starting my career. That's her cue to explode. She writes an extremely mean message filled with hate, disdain and degrading stuff. 'You'll never learn how to live your life' 'Loser' 'Whiner' 'This is the same irrational behavior as at that concert when you were arguing with random ppl'... She also told me she would never reply again. 

Then it becomes chaos in my head. It was already chaos, but after that it just went overboard. I hate those insults so much. They repeat in my head all the time. I can't cope with it. I'm too emotionally weak already. I struggled to recover from my suicidal thoughts and this on top of it was too much. 'You'll never learn how to live your life'... 'I will move on to someone/something much better'. Constantly repeating in my head. Flashbacks to arguing at that concert. Feeling even worse about myself. 

Initially fucking HATED her! She was 8 years older and came into my life and I never asked for it and then she can't even bring herself to end it without a bunch of insults that are so toxic for my mental health at that time! So I was fucking angry and wrote insulting messages back in the beginning. 

After that I changed though. I started to realize that I was in the wrong. I changed my tone and began explaining all the time. Begging to talk it out. I did this for like 4 to 5 months because I couldn't think of anything else. In the end I wrote an extremely personal e-mail to her workmail that got forwarded to her co-workers in which I called myself a piece of shit and more dramatic stuff 😓 I fully took the blame in that one. I still had one weak moment and wrote another message like a month later to her LinkedIn and that was it.

I want to die,"I want to kill myself. I've been thinking about it nonstop for weeks. A lot more recently, I have started doing research and I feel like I'm really warming up to the idea. I have lost the motivation to do anything. The other night, I went for a walk because I wanted to throw myself in front of a car. I learned how to tie a noose. I'm also considering trying to cut my radial artery and bleed to death.

I really don't want to devastate my family and I know my dad would take it really hard because we're really close and he knows how much I've been struggling, and he's been doing everything he can to try to help me. That's what's keeping me alive right now.

I feel so alone and useless -extreme social anxiety-,"I want to erase my existence so badly im 16 yr old girl btw

My relationship with my family is not healthy backside i rarely talk to them even tho they're good ppl, Whenever we have to eat on dining room i only stay quiet cuz i dont have anything to contribute on the conversation or we have awkward silence which i feel so guilty for because i feel like  I'm the cause of that . I never had a deep or just a normal  conversation with my parents or anyone with my family I'm a super shy, quiet and reserved person

 Theres no one i know that knows me completely because  I'm not good at expressing myself

I only have less than 10 good friends at school 2 on my section but only surface level friendship i don't talk to any other of my classmates.  Online classes give me so much anxiety especially when reciting to the point i cant even recite i just go silent ... what more on face to face classes ughhh

My social media=Facebook is dead , I don't post anything cuz i don't know how or why it wouldn't get any likes anyways. I don't post selfies I'm ugly and insecure

I could write a ton of negative traits rather than positive ones 

i don't have anything good at but I'm only good at drawing I'm really into it, decent skills since I was 10 yrs old i became good at drawing anime girls but i rarely show off my drawings to other people which makes me idk 'why am i keeping this to myself' tho i want to share it with other people to see .... i just cant i don't know how I feel embarrassed for drawing anime girls and liking anime

It's like what I really love its embedded in my heart

But i know it wouldn't contribute for my future I cant even recite in class or write good essays or think critically or say something intellectually , i feel so stupid im simple minded 


To summarize: I rarely talk, I'm too naive and dumb for this world, has no social life so alone i wanna die im wasting all opportunities im fucked up no one likes me

Right now on 24-7 suicide watch in a psych hospital. I noticed the windows are locked but not barred. We’re on the 5th floor.

I could just take a chair, smash the windows with it, and then jump. The staff won’t realise if the breaking sound is not that loud, and if they do it would take them maybe 10 seconds to come. Plenty of time.

Please don’t read if you yourself are currently suicidal,"I don’t want to trigger anyone or make anyone’s suicidal thoughts worse, I just need to speak to someone, anyone. I wish there was a way for me to end my life without my family being sad. I know it’s impossible, and that’s why I’m still alive. I feel like no matter whether I do it or not I’m hurting people I love. And I love them so much. I feel guilty for intertwining myself in their lives to the point where my death would really negatively affect them. Especially when I think of my mam, dad, sister and boyfriend. I feel guilty for wasting four years of NHS therapy for me to still be at this point. I feel guilty for not being the daughter my parents deserve and my boyfriend is the best person I know, he deserves the world. My OCD holds me back in life, it affects my whole family and also my boyfriend’s life. The irony is, my OCD centres around the fear that people I love will get hurt, and yet by worrying about it, I end up hurting the people I love because they have to deal with my constant anxiety and depression. It’s an endless cycle. I really really want to have a positive impact on people and it seems like I’m negatively affecting people every day.

No Contact with abusers.,"Hey everyone.

I'm feeling super foggy today...it was my birthday a few days ago and that brings a lot of trauma and  anxiety. I'm 26 years old finally. I moved to New York from the Midwest a couple months ago to start a new life with my friends but my ptsd seems to have followed me. 

Today's been really bad, I think I need help but my insurance doesn't kick in until December. If I were to go to the emergency room and tell them my situation would they contact my family against my will? They are the reason I'm suicidal and I have not been financially or legally dependent on them since I was 19 but my driver's license is an old address from that family. Any insight would be cool.

Going on medical leave,I was having a very bad panic attack while studying for an exam Tuesday. I went to see the counselor who basically gave me no choice but to go on medical leave. I already had 4 exams to make up for being in the psych ward twice but going on leave was the last thing I wanted to do. But now I am and a year behind. I feel like a failure to myself and to my mom. I really feel suicidal now. I’ve been having images of killing myself play over and over in my head for the past few weeks and just got out of the hospital last week. I honestly don’t know what to do. I wanted to go into nursing after graduating pharmacy school. Maybe it’s a sign that I should drop out. I just want to kill myself because I hate myself.

Getting tired,"Don’t you ever feel like committing suicide but it’s litterally too much work? Like f*** what people gonna say “oh he/she was very gifted and nice and etc” f*** all the sob stories I’m talking about ghosting every one because at the end of the day there is exactly no one that will care to at least believe or trust anymore because everyone thinks “he/she is good they always happy and positive” but thank you guys for reading my rant. 
I really don’t want to be seeing people say there’s plenty of people that care for you or what about family because oh boy family is the least that I trust I’m a black sheep even if I told them. The past few years of my life been drugging myself to the point where a lot of drugs won’t work on me unless it’s strong dosage not like I’m a addict. I did attempt to overdose on random prescription pills but i ended up passed out on my bed for few days with no one noticing I was in bed the past few days few years ago. I tried to commit suicide by gun but couldn’t pull the trigger so I tried to  join the military as a way to die instead of suicide by gun. I almost gave up on life and wanted to jump off a bridge but I couldn’t move due to my over excessive thinking and phobia of heights causing my leg to freeze and I couldn’t move a inch of my legs so I stand there for hours until I went off somewhere (true story not even a excuse to say I couldn’t jump). Sometimes I really want to know at the end of my time what will happen if I had never exist or if I had chosen to jump or gun to the head. Most of the times I find it easier for me to hurt my self and remember the pain not by knife but punching a metal wall multiple times until my hands give up giving me a bruised broken hand/leg.
I went to therapy but that ended up as a joke and anger management ended up as a joke so in the end what’s the purpose of living if even if you failed suicide attempt who gonna give a shit not a lot of people. I’ve litterally been though so much suicide attempts i permanently have a poker face and I don’t even bother to show “true” happiness. 

For anyone reading I did not join the military I attempted to join multiple times but got decline.

I think I’m gonna kill myself soon,"I don’t know where else to go and have no one else to talk to about any of this, so I’m just gonna rant and ramble on here to get these thoughts out. As the first quote of the book/film states, “I’m thinking of ending things”. I think I’m getting pretty close to the end of my life, like I’ve always known that my life would be taken by my own hands. Its loomed over me my entire life. 

I’m 22 and my life is far more of a mess than the average young person in their early 20s. I’m a college drop out with no sense of direction or motivation to even try to find that within myself. I’ve never had a sense of drive and I’ve always known this about myself from early childhood, even though I’m probably one the most passionate and giving people that you could ever meet. My future already feels like it’s been decided for me and the outlook is not good. I’ve never been in a relationship and I’ve never even kissed anyone. Even though I considered myself and am considered by others to be attractive and have a great personality, I either have too many walls built up to let someone in or I’m just not anyone’s type. My relationship with my friends has felt extremely one sided for a very long time now, and some of these friends I’ve had since elementary school. I always have to ask to hang out and make the plans for everyone. I didn’t even get gifts from them on my birthday this year (not that I really wanted something, just the gesture that mattered). I do sooo much for others, but I can’t even remember the last time anyone did something for me that didn’t allow the other person to gain something from the situation. I can’t stand listening to trivial complaints anymore, knowing that their problems aren’t actual problems and it’s just normal young adult complications. Especially since if I were to voice my problems, it would be too much for them to handle. I was abused for many years by my stepfather and even though I was able to move out last year finally, he still has control over my life by keeping my mother from me while she’s jobless and carless (due to pandemic). Oh, and also because of this pandemic, everyone in my close family is jobless and financially in shambles. I was kept in a second house (mother in law suite) with barely any access to the outside world and was constantly monitored on cameras for 2 years until I was able to get a car and job to get away. Prior to this, I lived in Maine to finish my junior and senior years of HS so I didn’t have to live with my stepfather then. He even got rid of my cats while I wasn’t there and I never got to say goodbye to them. They’re currently starting a divorce, but even still, I haven’t been able to hug my own mother since March. And even though I’ve moved out, I just feel worse about the entire situation since I can’t help my mom. I’ve seen multiple therapist and it usually starts off ok for the first few weeks, but ends within the first few months because I wind up feeling worse about other aspects of my life. I’m a clinically depressed, paranoid Bipolar with ADHD and insomnia. I also have problems with addiction and have a dependency on weed that I can’t break. I’ve tried many types of medications, rehab, and antidepressants that all have side effects that I can’t work with. After all this and all this time I’m still alone and have no plans for the holidays. They really just serve as a reminder that I really am alone. These are just some of the examples of how hopeless and ridiculous my life has turned into. I really just see no point in continuing on when I already know things won’t get better and I can’t help myself anyways. Really the only thing that’s stopped me in the past is because I know what this would do to my mother, but I really just can’t keep going much longer.

When you care about everyone else but nobody cares about you,"I can't take it, I'm exhausted and tired of caring. I pour my heart out into all of my relationships to make sure my friends, family, strangers, whoever feel genuinely cared for. I had this revelation years ago and it doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out no one cares about me, not genuinely at least. Maybe they care when I benefit them, but other than that not at all. I know they don't have to or are required to care for me, but damn, it'd be nice if at least one did.

&amp;#x200B;

How can I keep living knowing this is true? That all of my relationships present and future will be the same way. No one will care for me, but I will keep caring for others. I can't keep going like that, I'm defeated by the coldness around me. The lack of love and support consumes me. I don't care anymore, I'm done care about anyone else, not even myself. Death is nothingness, no temporary happiness, sadness, victory, or defeat. Even if you think you care, you don't, my heart has turned cold, and I don't see any other option.

"I feel completely lost. Not in immediate danger, but I just really can't see a point to living. I don't know if I'll get advice here but every other sub would probably ban me for expressing suicidal thoughts like they have before lol.","I talked to my therapist today, he was the first therapist to directly address my grades and struggles in highschool. He was realistic and treated me like an adult, none of which the others have. I can't find motivation to go to any of my classes. I've always lacked that motivation but now it's especially strong given remote learning. I've skipped almost every class and what hasn't been skipped I don't turn in any work and am failing. He gave me a few options on how we should find a solution to this, and basically at this rate I told him I don't think I will ever get enough motivation to bring up my grades, I just don't care about school enough. It's not important to me and is awful for my mental health, I've wanted to kill myself hundreds of times over school, and have come close to really doing it (even making attempts but failing), albeit I didn't tell him that part. The most realistic thing for me to do is to either drop out and get a GED, or motivate myself to get the bare minimum of C's and D's so I can graduate. He told me with how my grades look, I'm not getting into any colleges anyways.

When asked what was keeping me from dropping out already, I told him basically nothing but the fact that it's not what my parents want. He told me to focus on what I want. And I absolutely want to drop out. I have since I was 12. 

While I was at the therapy yeah I was happy an adult could finally acknowledge that school just isn't for me and that there could be another option for me. It was a relief. But now I just feel lost again.

I feel like having a GED just means I'm a failure. I know it doesn't mean that, but after all the pressure that's been put on for me for so long even knowing that I'm not a failure, I'll still feel ashamed for it. Let's say hypothetically I do get my GED, what then? I start working? Who's to say I'm not so depressed I can't work either? What if school is a billion times easier than work? What if my anxiety and other issues like (suspected but undiagnised) Autism/Asperger's keeps me from being able to function? Nobody cares if you have a panic attack every day in school. They're forced to deal with you anyways. But if I have a panic attack every day at work? Won't I get fired? What's so hard about school for me anyways? I feel like I'm burnt out over school, but what if I'm just burnt out over life in general? Having to work won't suddenly change any of that if it's life I'm tired of. Even if I'm not tired of life, won't I get to that point eventually with working? Even if I don't start off with a full time job the idea of eventually having to work 40 hours a week is exhausting just from the thought alone, none the less actually doing it. People always tell me that highschool was the easiest time for them. I'm not bullied or abused or anything like that. I should have like literally the most perfect life, and I would if I didn't have mental issues. If I can't handle highschool how am I supposed to handle the real world?

Life (for me, anyways, and for many others) just seems awful no matter how you spin it. When I was suicidal before today, it was short term. Guilt over being a failure in my classes. Now I'm suicidal over the long term. What is there to look forward to? Is it really anything worth staying for? I keep telling myself that the moment I'm an adult I'll buy a gun so I can kill myself, and then that's the end of it. Life just seems exhausting and even more so for someone like me, who gets drowned out by the system and tossed to the side like litter because it wasn't made for me.

In the car on the ride to my therapy session, I had this thought: It's not that I want to die, I just don't want to be alive.

fml,"I restarted a job I hate because I was getting pressure from my parents to make ""doctor"" money. 

For some context, I graduated medical school and started a residency training program but didn't complete it. I completed enough to still get a license to practice medicine. However, I can't be board-certified and that is the big buzzword and criteria to get employed as a doctor these days. I saved my life by walking away from that residency training and the only reason I was able to do that was because I had this epiphany in the midst of suicidal thoughts--it's not my life that I hate, it's just this current life/work environment and I have a choice to walk away from it. I didn't want to be another dead doctor statistic. The trade-off was that I'd have to find some other way to pay back all my loans. Long story short, I tried some stuff and it didn't work and covid hit and for some stupid reason, I decided moving back in with my parents would be a good idea as they'd become more supportive of me since I got diagnosed with depression in med school.

Anyway, I've been home for quite a few months now, trying to set boundaries with my parents and pushing back on their pressure for me to be a real doctor. I do currently work part-time but not as a doc and I have some other income so this allows me to live month to month (not ideal) including being able to pay rent to my parents and paying back a little of my student loans each month as well.

So I finally caved and restarted this job I hated but makes closer to doctor level money. It's only my third day. First 2 at the office and today and likely tomorrow doing lots of paperwork. I've been trying to stay neutral about it but today as I was filling out the tedious paperwork, I noticed more stress starting to creep in... anyway spiral to why not just kill myself? We're all gonna die one day or another? Why not now? It seems so silly to kms over this and it is. And I won't do it. I'll just wallow more in this and grit my teeth through this work so I can make the stupid $ to feed back into the system. But the thought of suicide is relieving. The thought of just walking away from all this responsibility.

Things at home.,"I’m an 18 year old girl. And I want to tell you guys of something you might think is far fetched or normal (it’s up to you haha) I live in my parents room, I have a bed but we share a room. And worst of all we don’t have a living room. The living room is converted into a bedroom in which my cousin and her husband lives and pays to live in. Living like this for years, up until now was okay. But lately I feel as though I could really be happy to have my own space. My parents are determined in buying a property etc etc so I don’t see myself with my own bedroom for the next years either. I know it is off topic. But it’s all got something to do with why I feel they way we all in here do (in a way) living with them under the same room has made things very very uncomfortable for me.",Serious-Cup1291,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxvtkh/things_at_home/,18 year old girl want tell guy something might think far fetched normal haha live parent room bed share room worst living room living room converted bedroom cousin husband life pay live living like year wa okay lately feel though could really happy space parent determined buying property etc etc see bedroom next year either know topic got something feel way way living room ha made thing uncomfortable,thing home,serious cup 1291,786,15,serious cup 1291 18 year old girl want tell guy something might think far fetched normal haha live parent room bed share room worst living room living room converted bedroom cousin husband life pay live living like year wa okay lately feel though could really happy space parent determined buying property etc etc see bedroom next year either know topic got something feel way way living room ha made thing uncomfortable thing home
Putting my plan in motion,"I’ve been depressed for almost 2 years now. Been in a on and off relationship for the past 4 years. The woman I love left me and has since blocked me on everything and won’t respond to any of my messages. She finally broke things off completely because I admitted that I wanted to kill myself because of the pain I carry from us being apart. She told me that she couldn’t deal with my manipulation anymore. Playing her feelings. But I wasn’t trying too. I was being honest with my feelings. Now after 5 months of no contact I just can’t handle it anymore. I feel despair and like a failure for losing her. I’m 27, down to 90lbs, and can barely look at myself in the mirror without being disgusted with myself. Since the beginning of the year I lost her, my job, my car, my apartment and now I’m living with my parents again. I’ve tried medication, going to in patient facilities and talking to my parents but I just can’t see the light. So I finally decided to sell anything of value I have and put that money towards getting a gun. I’m currently in the process of selling things to get enough money. I’ve found sites like armslist and texasguntrader that have listings for guns where you can meet up with someone to buy kinda Craigslist style. Once I get the gun I plan on going somewhere peaceful outside and enjoy my last moments starring at the stars. My depression is so bad that my dad told me he’s going to buy me another car but I don’t even want it. I’m hoping I can carry out my plan before he wastes the money. I could win the lottery with the damn mega ball and cash option and still wouldn’t make me crack a smile or see a glimmer of hope. I’m old enough to realize that material things won’t give me happiness but rather the connections I have with others. But the only connection I care about having is with my ex. I wanted to marry her, buy us a house, and have children together. But I lost her and know she’s never coming back to me ever again. I just want the pain I have in my heart and mind to go away. I’ve tried before to get over her and I already know that I’m not able to. I hope she’s happy and has a life that she’s always dreamed of. She’s a great woman and so beautiful inside and out. Hopefully wherever I go after this I can watch over her and be her guardian angel.",bhern1293,2,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxvnyp/putting_my_plan_in_motion/,depressed almost 2 year relationship past 4 year woman love left ha since blocked everything respond message finally broke thing completely admitted wanted kill pain carry u apart told deal manipulation anymore playing feeling trying wa honest feeling 5 month contact handle anymore feel despair like failure losing 27 90lbs barely look mirror without disgusted since beginning year lost job car apartment living parent tried medication going patient facility talking parent see light finally decided sell anything value put money towards getting gun currently process selling thing get enough money found site like armslist texasguntrader listing gun meet someone buy kinda craigslist style get gun plan going somewhere peaceful outside enjoy last moment starring star depression bad dad told going buy another car even want hoping carry plan waste money could win lottery damn mega ball cash option still make crack smile see glimmer hope old enough realize material thing give happiness rather connection others connection care ex wanted marry buy u house child together lost know never coming back ever want pain heart mind go away tried get already know able hope happy ha life always dreamed great woman beautiful inside hopefully wherever go watch guardian angel,putting plan motion,b hern 1293,2298,25,b hern 1293 depressed almost 2 year relationship past 4 year woman love left ha since blocked everything respond message finally broke thing completely admitted wanted kill pain carry u apart told deal manipulation anymore playing feeling trying wa honest feeling 5 month contact handle anymore feel despair like failure losing 27 90lbs barely look mirror without disgusted since beginning year lost job car apartment living parent tried medication going patient facility talking parent see light finally decided sell anything value put money towards getting gun currently process selling thing get enough money found site like armslist texasguntrader listing gun meet someone buy kinda craigslist style get gun plan going somewhere peaceful outside enjoy last moment starring star depression bad dad told going buy another car even want hoping carry plan waste money could win lottery damn mega ball cash option still make crack smile see glimmer hope old enough realize material thing give happiness rather connection others connection care ex wanted marry buy u house child together lost know never coming back ever want pain heart mind go away tried get already know able hope happy ha life always dreamed great woman beautiful inside hopefully wherever go watch guardian angel putting plan motion

At the edge of the world.,"In the last few months I've been dealing with my injured shoulder and feels like ive been given the run around, it has taken two MRIs and almost 5 months to even come close to the time try and fix the issue. My dominant shoulder is down and it is making it very difficult to even care for my children.

Not being able to really do my hobbies or take care of my children has made my depression almost unbearable. I was so down that my boss came in on his day off and brought me to the ER because he was concerned that i was going to take my own life. Had it not been for my wife and kids he wouldve been right. I've been insanely depressed and still now just want to lie down in my bed and give up. I am not giving up because as i said previously i have my wife and kids that i need to stay around for.

Due to my depression more than my injury ive been out of work for almost a month, so far my employer has been able to work with me to make sure i dont continue down the path of depression and self harm but there is always the fear that it wont last and eventually i will be let go. It looks like my shoulder is going to take at least another 6 months to under the perfect conditions before I can even use it again. 

With that being said i know a lot of people tell me to turn to God because i am quite religious, my issue with this is that for the first time since i first went to Acquire The Fire (a big three day event that focuses around Christianity) I dont feel the embrace of God that i once felt, Ive been longing for the feeling that i felt standing in front of the David Crowder band singing ""How he Loves"" with my eyes closed, its been over 10 years since i went and i never lost the feeling i gained that night until recently. As much as it pains me to say I feel like im slowly losing my faith with nothing working to stem the bleeding. 

I am struggling to find the drive to continue moving forward. I’m on the verge of losing everything. My cars. My house. My wife is having PTSD from her childhood because of my depression. I just. Don’t know how or what to do. The only thing that makes me feel even half calm is the sweet embrace of death.",Skitso-the-noooob,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxznpm/at_the_edge_of_the_world/,last month dealing injured shoulder feel like ive given run around ha taken two mri almost 5 month even come close time try fix issue dominant shoulder making difficult even care child able really hobby take care child ha made depression almost unbearable wa bos came day brought er wa concerned wa going take life wife kid wouldve right insanely depressed still want lie bed give giving said previously wife kid need stay around due depression injury ive work almost month far employer ha able work make sure dont continue path depression self harm always fear wont last eventually let go look like shoulder going take least another 6 month perfect condition even use said know lot people tell turn god quite religious issue first time since first went acquire fire big three day event focus around christianity dont feel embrace god felt ive longing feeling felt standing front david crowder band singing love eye closed 10 year since went never lost feeling gained night recently much pain say feel like im slowly losing faith nothing working stem bleeding struggling find drive continue moving forward verge losing everything car house wife ptsd childhood depression know thing make feel even half calm sweet embrace death,edge world,skit ooo b,2160,25,skit ooo b last month dealing injured shoulder feel like ive given run around ha taken two mri almost 5 month even come close time try fix issue dominant shoulder making difficult even care child able really hobby take care child ha made depression almost unbearable wa bos came day brought er wa concerned wa going take life wife kid wouldve right insanely depressed still want lie bed give giving said previously wife kid need stay around due depression injury ive work almost month far employer ha able work make sure dont continue path depression self harm always fear wont last eventually let go look like shoulder going take least another 6 month perfect condition even use said know lot people tell turn god quite religious issue first time since first went acquire fire big three day event focus around christianity dont feel embrace god felt ive longing feeling felt standing front david crowder band singing love eye closed 10 year since went never lost feeling gained night recently much pain say feel like im slowly losing faith nothing working stem bleeding struggling find drive continue moving forward verge losing everything car house wife ptsd childhood depression know thing make feel even half calm sweet embrace death edge world

I'm a virgin, never been in a relationship, never even had my first kiss. I've had nothing. I'm a fucking loser, I'm ugly so that doesn't help. 

Its nothing but torture. Can't and won't come out. Can't find a partner, can't have kids the natural right way. I would do anything to take this away from me, to never feel it again. I can't even look at attractive women anymore. Don't tell me that I will find someone. That is statistically very unlikely. Dont tell me all this bullshit, because its not fucking true. 

I tell everyone that I never want these things but I do. I always say I never want children or a relationship but I say it because I *know* ill never have those things.

Fuck Society,"NSFW

You know what this whole shit i’m going through right now is ridiculous and overall shouldn’t have to happen. I (M19) have a suicidal girlfriend (F19) that has her mental health absolutely deteriorating due to so many factors that we face as youth and early adults that it’s absurd that it is even possible to live through this shit. Like the stress of university, work, family, friends, significant others and already poor mental health all held under by COVID-19 restrictions is absolutely ridiculous. I have been this girls only outlet for almost seven months now because of this covid bull shit where, no matter what option the government pick, a group of people will die. And you know what fine that’s understandable but now having to deal with all the liability horseshit that makes suicide prevention so fucking unsuccessful has literally driven me to the edge. Like how on earth am I expected to do all of the above stressful things as well as a semi pro sport and my family being high risk for COVID-19. Like honestly what the fuck is wrong with society where “liability purposes” and “insurance reasons” dictate how fucking humane and actually fucking caring a suicide prevention line can be. It’s fucking ridiculous and I could not be more frustrated right now. I am in over my head with my own mental health beginning to deteriorate all because of these bull shit hotlines that can only answer with fucking links to resources like honestly what if I called them when i was ready to jump off a bridge or some shit. Are they just gonna send me some links so they’re “not liable” like for fucksakes just help me help my fucking girlfriend.

I think a lot about my mom, cause she already has so much problems, I don't want to make her any sadder, but at same time, I feel like this world is not a place where I want to live.

"All prevention tactics don’t seems to work for me, I don’t really like this world ya know?","I didn’t ask to be born here, I was forced into this crap, these systems, a trash society. 

I can’t even get help without emptying my entire bank account. Talking about it doesn’t help, doing something about it also doesn’t help, meds don’t help, nothing actually does, not therapy not anything unfortunately.

I have around 6 mental disorders, life is truely hell. There’s no snapping out of it or trying to change or challenge my thinking, no change of lifestyle or job helps. Suicide lifelines are useless for me, any type of prevention doesn’t work.

I don’t feel connected to the human race, it’s as if I’m trying to speak to a wall, and once my ideas are out I’m treated in subpar manner, like I’m some sort of rodent. And that’s not my negative outlook, it’s what actually happens..

I don’t want to work my entire life, eat, drink, or have consciousness really, one of my coping mechanisms is sleeping for extreme amounts to escape this world, yet it still haunts me in my daily-weekly nightmares.

I don’t desire friends or people, I wish to live a quite and alone life, but that’s not possible these days. You’ll constantly need money, which means interacting with people, the very thing I deathly avoid.

I’ve looked at all my options, none of them are good. Death truely seems to be the final solution, I don’t care that it inflicts pain on others, I want to be selfish here, think of that what you will. 

I have no access to guns, but pills are abundant, I set a date for 2-3 years from now, enough time for improvement to set in, and if no sufficient improvement happens then I’ll end my life of course.

Told my dad I was suicidal and he did nothing,"I (20F) often get bullied by the rest of my family (I have four brothers, only girl). For one reason or another, everything is always my fault. 

First off, my oldest brother (32M) wrote me off for good last year because he asked me to give his ex girlfriend’s belongings back to her. He would do this a lot, and one time he asked I didn’t have the time (I was a caregiver and had a 12hr shift). He told me that since he co-signed for my car that I should’ve had his back, and said I wasn’t family.

My two other brothers (26M) (24M) live with him and are basically sheep, and took his side. I found out that the 24 y/o actually agreed with me, but didn’t have the guts to say anything. 

The 26 y/o sexually assaulted me when I was a child, and was horrible to me for years. He just apologized for everything a few months ago, so I guess he’s trying to make amends.

My youngest brother (19M), I thought, was my best friend. We frequently get into arguments because he doesn’t have a car and I always take him everywhere. I honestly don’t mind, but he gets into these moods where it seems like my very existence is a bother to him. Last week after we got into an argument I overheard him telling my dad how annoying I was, and I’ll admit, it hurt me. I take care of him like my own (my mom left us when I was 15- she was a drug addict and child abuser).

After the argument, I told my dad that I wanted to die because everybody around me hated me. He said “why would you do that to me?” and criticized me for not getting any help. I did make an appointment to see a psychiatrist, but I don’t know if I can make it to Sunday. Nobody has checked on me all week. I could’ve killed myself two days ago and no body would’ve noticed.

The only thing I deserve is to pay for my mistakes,"The overwhelming guilt and regret for all the choices I’ve made is unbearable. All of my decisions have led me here. I’ve hurt people, done terrible disgusting things, been a burden and only let people down. I’m retarded, no seriously I am mentally retarded I have been diagnosed. I try my hardest to be the best I can be to be a regular person, i 100% believe I think like a regular person does. The way it all goes wrong is what I choose to do. My actions, the way I talk and move. My poor judgement I make in the moment hurts people. In the past I made a really fucked up move, ever since I was a child I’ve tried to moved away from people. Ruined what could have been good long lasting friend ships simply because of my overwhelming guilt of what I did to someone and still managing to hurt them because they think they’ve done something wrong because I pushed my self away from them. I get close to someone and then rip my self away. 

All I’ve wanted to do since I was a child was die. It never leaves me. I’m now 17 and for the past 3-4 years suicide has been an almost daily thought, all the ways I could do it. I reach out for help and it looks like I’m seeking attention so I keep it all hidden to myself, no one ever takes suicide seriously until something happens. My diagnosis gave me a psychologist who hasn’t really helped me at all, I left school and work 9-5 at McDonald’s and every shift i imagine smashing my hand through the fry vat oil. I don’t believe in/trust religion anymore and have no beliefs of what happens when I die or what the point to all of this seemingly needless suffering is. I have sexual urges but I have seemingly no love interest wether that be man or women so girlfriends, boyfriends or just having friends in general has been hopeless. I almost feel like I suffer from a ptsd from what I did and have regular panic attacks about it. I just want to drop my job and sell all my shit so I don’t have to worry about paying them off. I simply want to lie on a bench for the rest of my life wether that be homeless or somehow still keeping my spot at my parents house. Either way I started caring less and less about life to now I’m at the point where I could throw away everything tonight right now. If I end up on the streets I don’t even care at least I would be forced to die sooner instead of waiting on my self to find a good way to do it. Discovered Australia’s got shooting ranges you can go to completely unlicensed with 12 gauge shot guns. Pretty fucking tempting lately. I’m out of options and out of time before I make some kind of decision. 

Any suggestions or life advice would be appreciated at this point. I’m even thinking of prolonging the last of my life by turning to a drug like weed which I’ve never touched before. I mean I know when I go down that path I’m well and truly fucked but at this point as I said I couldn’t care less if I was sleeping on a park bench tonight. Death just seems like the best escape, leave all this pointless suffering behind. Be at peace, like turning off a computer. No thoughts, no knowledge that you exist and well technically not existing at all. Being free. I will never suffer again.

My dad up and fucked off. And I dropped all my friends I used to have because I was still last with them. After leaving the school (along with three other kids from the group), I was left out of everything, where as the other kids were invited to everything. Even the kid we all found hard to be around. So the be all end all is that the only time I matter is when I’m needed or I’m missing, so, why in the fuck should I live knowing that. Also.

There’s so many of us :(,"I got in a verbal fight with my brother. The rage the depression and suicidal thoughts are awful every time I argue with him. It’s soo intense that I desperately want to die. 

I want to run away. Leave it behind and start fresh but I don’t have a job rn. I wanna hide somewhere and deal with just me.

I wish there was somewhere I could go to rest. Low on cash to stay at a motel. Walking around my neighborhood crying in the dark seems pathetic. 

Where could I go? No job no money. Streets are scary. Loony bin sounds scary bc they won’t let me go easily. Shelters have too many ppl who prob have covid.

I just want a place to escape to not feel anything when this happens. I feel miserable right now. 

This rage drives me to make harmful and impulsive decisions.

A fair question?,"Yesterday my suicidal thoughts got the better of me and I drove out into the country until I had barely any fuel and then after 5 or so hours I steamed out and asked my brother for help to get back home, a question he asked me ""Why do you want to die?""

i want to do it but i'm too scared of failing.,"i'm 20 and my life is at a point where i dont believe i can ever turn it around and be happy. i have been suicidal since i was 6, tried for the first time when i was 8, the second time when i was 13, the third when i was 14, and the fourth when i was 15. i have struggled with self harm, anorexia, bulimia, abuse, rape, gaslighting, death threats, blackmailing, depression, anxiety, hallucinations, and so much more, i am just tired. i was recently diagnosed with BPD, i have no control over my life, i am forced to study something i hate, and i am completely alone. i'm so sick it literally is not worth it to even fight it anymore. my mind slowly shut down, then it claimed my body, and now it controls everything. i gave up my dreams to please my family and now i'm miserable and incapable of changing it, most days i'm too frail to do anything. i pushed all my friends and loved ones away because i am too much. in the 5 years since my last attempt i have really tried to get better, so find happiness, but more and more trauma and abuse has come my way, to the point that when we got quarantined i just gave up. my family thinks i'm just lazy, and honestly, i'm tired of proving them wrong. they can call me lazy when im dead if they want.

so i'm ready. i have stockpiled my xanax, i have alcohol, i have my antidepressants and other random medications. i wouldnt even be writing this if it were not for how afraid i am i might survive. i already survived an overdose once and the pain is... terrible, but i have no choice.

Its been awhile...but I think I should try again,"The last time I tried to kill myself was 7 years ago, in July 2013. After treatment, I started creating more advanced career goals to keep my mind off the loneliness and isolation I felt from the new people I was supposed to be friends with, in a place I never had a choice to be in. I felt like striving to complete those tasks would put me in a better place than where I was, and I was right financially. But my family just left me off here and destroyed my group of close-knit friends I had had. And the two times I complained, I was told it didn't really matter. 

These days I hear ""That must have been really hard"". Bitch, why couldn't you tell me that then? Due to that response, I figured being heartless and callous was the supposed norm. Your friends, your relationships, they don't matter. Previously, I had a great happy group to trust and rely on. And then, in the blink of an eye, all those friends and connections disappeared. Even when I was asked if I would prefer to keep them, and I said yes. So I sold out my family and friends. So why invest again? Again and again, the moves were chaotic. I never really felt that I would finally feel that happiness I hear other folks talk about. 

I tried to recreate a new social circle, spending years and years to get to know these folks well, or so I thought. Then, on the same day, both my best friend and ex-girlfriend lied/omitted info to authorities, but there was no one left for me to prove it. I always had thought my friend would have had my back. I had his and got him out of several tight spots. And my ex had manipulated my living situation and independence throughout the relationship. It took me a while to realize I was right all along; you should never trust anyone. And I realize it was my fault for letting them sell me out.

It's been 7 years. I've advanced far enough in my career since the first attempt, but when I clock out of work, all I can hear is the voice I'm starting to imagine in my head. It isn't particularly comforting...constant berating, belittling...anything to motivate me to do something better, motivated by depreciating self-esteem. It doesn't help that I don't often talk to actual people anymore due to COVID. Just screens.   


I feel I would have been better off finishing the job 7 years ago. I wish I wouldn't have told my plan. I wish I wouldn't have tried again only to find my dreams could never come true.

"Truly, I find no purpose within me.","I'm a male, 28 years old, I live alone in a small apartement in the middle of fucking nowhere. I work as a lifeguard/janitor/factotum under a 5 star thermal hotel in Italy. Despite being a great goal to work in such a prestigious hotel, I feel lonely and unsatisfied. I can't make connection with people and I feel a great sensation of emptiness everytime I take the car and go to work. Sometimes there are days when I basically feel dull and devoid of any emotion. I am familiar with this stuff, since I've been in therapy for basically 4 years, gulping pills of Paroxetine each day of those years. However, it didn't help, and I knew the only way to move forward is to gain some money to live the life I wanted to live. I accepted everything life threw at me, disgraces and opportunities in equal measure, and I weathered the storm. However, now, I fear I might fall to the same path moved by inertia, therefore towards misery again. Furthermore, with this whole Covid predicament going on, I can't go swimming, which was the only way I could ease the pain away. I am still a virgin and kind of a dork. I open myself too much while making conversation with my colleagues, which makes them feel weird. I wish I could have some purpose in life, some self worth and respect for myself but I have got none. My parents call me on the phone each and every day, which makes me feel angry for some strange reason, since most the time I think they call me so they don't feel guilt for the fact they didn't love me enough when I was younger. My father was abusive towards my mother and me, as my mother and my sister were towards me, the latter ones don't remember, however I do. I was a problematic child until I reached 16 yo: I used to steal out of my mother's purse, even my grandma's, I stole from my sister to get it the way I wanted to. I wouldn't steal from a stranger, but from them I would steal with no remorse at that time. I lied constantly about school and I spent most of the money I stole in alchool, getting myself drunk. It felt good, it made me feel happy, though it wasn't true happiness and a momentary relief from a condition of unacceptance of my true self and a open door the path of eternal repent. I hate myself for that. I oftenly write on paper long paragraphs of insults towards myself, hoping I could change something about myself and take action for the disgusting sullen filth that I am and embracing what I really want in life. I really feel I'm out of place in this world and I 'm not a fitting gear inside this great cosmic mechanism which is this existence. I want a way out of this misery, but sometimes I realize, after all that I've done I am not able to forgive myself and that I don't deserve any better than this predicament. So, basically I am here, a strawman without passions, emotionally vegetative and without further goals in life. I am simply a waste of air and space at this point.",FractalThoughtDevice,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxm7rj/truly_i_find_no_purpose_within_me/,male 28 year old live alone small apartement middle fucking nowhere work lifeguard janitor factotum 5 star thermal hotel italy despite great goal work prestigious hotel feel lonely unsatisfied make connection people feel great sensation emptiness everytime take car go work sometimes day basically feel dull devoid emotion familiar stuff since therapy basically 4 year gulping pill paroxetine day year however help knew way move forward gain money live life wanted live accepted everything life threw disgrace opportunity equal measure weathered storm however fear might fall path moved inertia therefore towards misery furthermore whole covid predicament going go swimming wa way could ease pain away still virgin kind dork open much making conversation colleague make feel weird wish could purpose life self worth respect got none parent call phone every day make feel angry strange reason since time think call feel guilt fact love enough wa younger father wa abusive towards mother mother sister towards latter one remember however wa problematic child reached 16 yo used steal mother purse even grandma stole sister get way wanted steal stranger would steal remorse time lied constantly school spent money stole alchool getting drunk felt good made feel happy though true happiness momentary relief condition unacceptance true self open door path eternal repent hate oftenly write paper long paragraph insult towards hoping could change something take action disgusting sullen filth embracing really want life really feel place world fitting gear inside great cosmic mechanism existence want way misery sometimes realize done able forgive deserve better predicament basically strawman without passion emotionally vegetative without goal life simply waste air space point,truly find purpose within,fractal thought device,2923,35,fractal thought device male 28 year old live alone small apartement middle fucking nowhere work lifeguard janitor factotum 5 star thermal hotel italy despite great goal work prestigious hotel feel lonely unsatisfied make connection people feel great sensation emptiness everytime take car go work sometimes day basically feel dull devoid emotion familiar stuff since therapy basically 4 year gulping pill paroxetine day year however help knew way move forward gain money live life wanted live accepted everything life threw disgrace opportunity equal measure weathered storm however fear might fall path moved inertia therefore towards misery furthermore whole covid predicament going go swimming wa way could ease pain away still virgin kind dork open much making conversation colleague make feel weird wish could purpose life self worth respect got none parent call phone every day make feel angry strange reason since time think call feel guilt fact love enough wa younger father wa abusive towards mother mother sister towards latter one remember however wa problematic child reached 16 yo used steal mother purse even grandma stole sister get way wanted steal stranger would steal remorse time lied constantly school spent money stole alchool getting drunk felt good made feel happy though true happiness momentary relief condition unacceptance true self open door path eternal repent hate oftenly write paper long paragraph insult towards hoping could change something take action disgusting sullen filth embracing really want life really feel place world fitting gear inside great cosmic mechanism existence want way misery sometimes realize done able forgive deserve better predicament basically strawman without passion emotionally vegetative without goal life simply waste air space point truly find purpose within

Death would make all of my problems go away,"I have quite a few problems on my plate. The biggest one is that I just lost my job about a week ago. Along with that, I’ve got bills that are adding up with no money to pay them with. I have a car that barely runs and will probably die or break down any minute. I just got served for small claims court over bad debt - with more to come. My credit is in the shitter. I can’t enroll in classes at school because I owe them money. I have student loans coming due next January. I’m morbidly obese and am no longer a candidate for weight loss surgery because I lost my health insurance when I lost my job. I have a bunch of mental health issues and probably won’t be able to continue seeking care and medication management because my mom makes too much for me to get state health insurance, even though I’m no longer her dependent. I *might* be eligible for unemployment, but it only pays about 2/3 of what I was making after taxes and what I was making after taxes was barely enough to get by. On top of that, I can’t apply for work until mid-December since I can’t pass a drug test. I’m also not sure how I’m going to be able to pay back my loans given that I have no money and they’ll be drafted from my checking automatically. As if having no money wasn’t bad enough, I’ll now have negative money and have to pay for the privilege of having negative money.

I feel like I've reached the point where there's nothing left and I have no future...,"I'm not even sure where to start... but I've reached a point where I feel like there's nothing left and no future for me in life...

I've always been the unwanted child in my family, ""you're not special, you can easily be replaced"" to quote my parents over the years... And then they had a younger child and did replace me, confining me to the smallest room and leaving me to do everything by myself.

I tried drowning myself when I was 15, I somehow survived and decided that for whatever reason I survived I shouldn't waste a second chance but then when I was 16 I got my life destroyed by false rumors from other students who impersonated me in school with fake emails and Facebook accounts.

Thanks to them my name means shit and in my town getting a job won't happen because of the bs they did years ago. I've been trying to get a job just so I can get some money to start a new life somewhere ever since I left school 8yrs ago to no avail.

I can't move anywhere as I have no money to do so, and can't get a job to get the money. I had a volunteering role for a while but they threw me out when a student I went to school with visited where I was volunteering and spread shit about me to them.

I have no friends, nowhere to go, I'm unemployable and I'm worthless.

School Leaves Me Feeling Empty,"It's like I can never be good enough. I just exist day to day just trying to please everyone around me. I feel talentless and so stressed all the time. There are a billion things going on at once and I'm sick of playing this balancing act, sacrificing things to do well in the others. What's the fucking point? What's the fucking point of it all?

And in the odd time, I do have something to celebrate about, there's not a person to talk to about it. Because in their lens- my friends, family, teachers- that 85 wasn't good enough. It ain't good enough because schools want nineties. The system isn't about how well you improve or how much you try, no, it is a system that compares you to others and caters to neurotypical people. I've had a literal breakdown in most of my classes after grade 9 at this point. 

Everyone tells me I'm lazy, when just existing feels like the most exhausting thing to do. I can't do more when I am barely hanging on by a thread. That 60 may look bad to most people, and it definitely isn't my peak performance, but I look at that and smile because of the 50 I got last week. Or because I didn't think I understood it at all, and I still passed. Yet it is never good enough. Never. And then the people around me make me feel lazy and ungrateful for having those thoughts- ""you live in a first-world country, there are starving people! Be grateful and grind harder!""

The worst part of it all is when you tell people about the stress you have and the thoughts you have, they'll just say you're too much a coward to actually do it. The loneliness I have isn't due to a lack of people, it's due to a lack of understanding. 

People say your worth isn't assigned to grades, then turn around and berate you for anything less than they see fit. Every time I enter class, all I hear is people comparing their grades. It hurts me because people call their 90s bad, but I am objectively doing much worse when I am truly trying my best. 

I'm just sick of it. I really am. I just wanna sign myself out. With the marks I have now, there is no way I am getting into schools because of these elitist policies. In my country, it's very hard to get a good job without a degree, and I am a girl so I will be greatly discriminated against in skilled trades.

I don't really want to go into details about why I'm feeling suicidal, but I really could use some advice on what I can do to calm myself down. I've been suicidal for about 10 months now, but I do have enough hope to keep going. I don't want to die, I want things to change and I want to feel okay. However I can't see any way this will happen, and then I get suicidal because the idea of things being like this forever is just unbearable. I'm doing everything in my power to make things better, but I feel so stuck.   
Talking about how someone needs me in this world makes me feel guilty, then angry, and makes me want to self harm to punish myself for being selfish, and then I feel worse and want to die even more. It seems to be default response to people who are suicidal, but it backfires on me.   
I am in therapy already, but they can't fix the things that drives me to feel suicidal.

I let it in and it took everything.,"I want to start by saying I'm a diagnosed autistic man. High functioning. 39 years old and I want to die. The craziest part of this is that when you do the research, you'll find the average age of death for white autistic males is you guessed it, 39 years old. I've had suicidal thoughts most of my adult life. Two attempts. Both extremely close. First by cutting my wrists in a warm bath. Roomie found me. Saved my life. Second, years later, I was barricaded in my room with the cops at my door (on a wellness check). I told them I had a gun, which let me tell you, COMPLETELY changes the situation. TBefore it was all said and done, I'd opened the door and thrown the gun out in to the hall. I immediately changed my mind and dove after it at the same time one of two officers jumped on me to wrestle the gun out of my hands while screaming at his partner not to shoot me. He succeeded in getting the gun. I was handcuffed and put in a patrol car to be transported to hospital for psych eval. While sitting in the car the officer who had had his service weapon pointed at my head, came up to the car. He looked right in my eyes, crying, and he said ""man, I almost killed you just now. My finger was on the trigger, shaking, and I was deadlocked on your head"". 
Years go by and I'm involved in a horrible accident. A woman ran a red light, late for work, and t-boned me, tearing my car in half. Breaking my entire neck in the process. I was paralyzed below the neck for a short time, having an emergency surgery to try and correct it. Which by the Grace of God they did. However it just gave me partial feeling back, which I know is still great, but hard to live with when you're a drummer. I've played my entire life. Two very good signed bands. Father was a country star who got me in it early. He committed suicide a decade ago. Funny how that works. I've had three more surgeries the past four years. The last having a recovery window of 12-16 months. Having two steel plates, six pins, several multi level fusions, the pain is other worldly. I started using heroin after I figured out it was much easier to get versus going to the drs with the judgment, drug tests like you're on probation or some criminal. Expensive but easier to get. 
That brings me here. I want to die. I really, really do. I have nothing. I've lost everything. Relationships. Friendships. Family. Personal belongings. Everything. Gone. And I'm so tired of hurting mentally and physically. I might be able to fend this off if I was dealing with one or the other, not both at the same time. I don't know if anyone could. I've tried doing a bunch of heroin but I keep waking up. Every time I know I'm close to od'ing and I feel my self nodding off, I think ""this is it, the last deep sleep"". Then I wake up. Rinse and repeat. Fuck. I'm still here. 
I've read on hanging and with a 70% fatality rate, it seems to be the best method. I was always afraid of doing more damage to my neck, possibly paralyzing myself completely and living. That'd be my luck.

"Another post, another sad story, still there ?","Hi,

I don't even know why I'm writing right now. Maybe extreme boredom, because I already know that nobody in here can help me.

I'm just another post, some words placed here and here that creates a sentence, a story. We're all that on the web, just words, sad ones.

Speaking doesn't help me, it never did. Receiving support ? Again, just words on a hopeless little screen. I've talked to a therapist for three years, it never improved my condition, neither the pills (SSRI). It ended badly, and as pathetic as I am I've tried to recontact her but she didn't want to see me again. Then I went to see a CBT therapist, but it didn't improved my symptoms either.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I'm sick, I'm tired of talking, telling the same story, again and again, but nothing changes. I've followed every things they told me : go ahead rent a apartment and live by your own, go ahead go back to college (while I told bullying destroyed me, but I've followed what the first therapist said anyway but it went bad as expected), go to clubs, socialize.

&amp;#x200B;

I just **can't** socialize, I've been alone all my life, since primary school, I was all alone waiting for the playtime to pass, waiting it to pass, seeing all of the childrens playing with each others. Now it's still the same, I'm afraid of people, if I don't go towards them they NEVER go towards me. They don't give a shit about me, not a single fuck.

&amp;#x200B;

What's the point of living then ? I don't feel any emotions, I don't feel anything since years, neither hate, neither love, neither happiness. There's nothing left in that brain, it's all dead.

I never worked, and right now I don't want to work at all ! Working, but for what ? To continue my existence ? What's the point ? We work to live our life, not just continue it.

&amp;#x200B;

I even have symptoms that are not on any websites or books : I can't stretch, you know the stretching when you wake up or when you're tired ? I can't do it, because it **disappeared** from my automatic part of my brain, it doesn't happen naturally, I have to do it ""manually"" but it doesn't work.

A lot of manual processes of my body ceased to function, because I'm always looking at myself from an outside point of view. Like if there was a mirror in front of my face, all the time. I can never be at peace. Like, when I'm stretching, suddenly **I know** that I'm stretching so it ceases to function. And I can't prevent this. Like a knife trying to cut itself, it's impossible but there's a force, forcing it to do that.

&amp;#x200B;

I can't reach climax anymore, at the end there's a force ruining, crushing the pleasure, sweeping it away.

And that's a thing I think I always had : my mind wants to do the opposite ""I"" want, and it ALWAYS wins.

&amp;#x200B;

No words can describe how I feel,"This past year has not been fun. Life has never been easy, but from November 2019 to November 2020 life has been the cruelest to me. I've had a lot of suicidal ideation in this time frame too (after so many years of finally breaking free from those thoughts). They have come back in full force and it hasn't really been pretty.
Last year at this time, my family and I lost our home. My SO and I had to move in with their emotionally abusive family in hopes it'd be short term (still here btw), then COVID hit and things just turned into a straight shit show it feels like. I've always been a homebody, but I liked my few outings I'd do, but now I can't really... I can't catch a movie randomly, or enjoy a nice meal at restaurant on occasion. Then April 2nd my younger brother committed suicide.. that has been one of the toughest things to go through. It stirred up a lot of weird, mixed emotions... I've suffered from depression for so effing long and I've thought about suicide so much in my life, that I just started hating myself for wanting to die after my brother. Like it's so hard to explain the mixed feelings about suicide now and after him dying like that, there's no way in hell I could put our family through that for a SECOND TIME! Like Jesus I'd be such a lowly, selfish, piece of shit for that... So I must persevere this sad life. And now my SO is questioning themselves (both of his grandparents are on their deathbed right now) and just going through it too. But now it's causing our 5 year relationship to be questioned. It sounds weird, but I understand where they are coming from. They want to feel more independent and like they can do things for themselves.
They feel like they cannot accomplish anything on their own. It was a hard talk, but I understood honestly. Can't hate people for wanting to better themselves. But I just feel lost, can't formulate any words to describe my feelings. I don't want to lose more people in my life. Can something go right for once?

just a rant about how useless i feel,"For the last few weeks I can't stop thinking about killing myself. My life is definitely going nowhere but downhill and I cant imagine myself having a future. It's always been like this, though, I've never been able to envision my future self as living a good productive life. but its only been recently that I've actually thought of ending it.

My ADD makes me feel like a piece of shit. I haven't been productive in decades and I feel so stupid when it comes to school. I'm neck deep in missing assignments because I just couldn't care less about any of it. I don't give a shit about college, or my future at all. 

I don't think I'll actually do it, but at the end of the day it's all I can think about. I envision how I'd do it, what id leave behind, and what would happen when I was gone. I even wrote a suicide note for my friend to read if I follow through. (I wrote it cause apparently its supposed to make u feel better)

I also imagine failing my attempt. I somehow don't see failing the attempt as a negative, does that mean it'd all just be for attention?

Being Depressed and Suicidal and Trying to Catch up on School Sucks,"For me at least, my depression and suicidal thoughts takes the form that blocks off all base motivation, meaning, even if I want to get better, I can't by trying harder. What's worse, is I am behind in schoolwork because the suicidal thoughts and depression make it impossible to get schoolwork done. But I am supposed to take more breaks and shut off my brain. But to do that I need to get more behind in school work. It's so fucking hard.

I hate to say this, but this dilemma literally gives me no way out. I do not know what to do. Trying harder to get work done ends up making my brain just sorta crash, and causes stress problems which fuel depression and suicidal thoughts, and make me unable to work on stuff effectively the next time I work. But not working on school makes me get more behind, become more suicidal because I realize i am unable to get work done, and do not get anything done, but it gives my brain the rest it needs- just not the amount it needs. And I can't do anything about it, like, if it was just stress, i could power through it, do whatever it takes, but my brain just breaks when i try to do that, because there is no mental energy and the base-level motivation is impossible to get. And even if it does work to force myself once, I know it will get worse the next time i try from experience, making staying up to date in school basically impossible. Online classes makes it worse because, a. teachers don't know how to teach well, so i can't easily absorb info like i usually did, b. my hindsight bias, and lack of cognitive function and memory stemming from depression and insomnia make me retain like 50% of the info i normally would, and like 50% of the natural connections i should make. I need to somehow break from school and improve my mental health, but, im in high school and i can't drop out. Working on school makes me suicidal now. The sad part is, most of my teachers are pretty good and the online situation makes the class have less assignments and pretty much infinite time for assignments, which would be better than me just going to school normally, but i still have huge trouble. I can't join a study group because of corona, i am basically trapped in this stupid situation, where i know i won't suicide, but school makes me suicidal and worsens my condition, but i am left all alone to learn the content anyways and get the work done. I am losing a competitive internship i got that i really wanted, because of my declining mental health, I kept up with the work for the longest time, but because it was work i got suicidal thoughts trying to work, because i got suicidal, i couldn't focus and fell behind ultimately just withdrawing. I am literally in an impossible situation, and I know i am (or was pre-depression at least) incredibly smart, but because it affects my ability to learn so much and do academic work, i can't learn. It is so frustrating, i have tried literally everything i can do from a mindset perspective, and i don't have an obvious idea or habit to solve like it is in some cases, so i have no idea what is healthy anymore and what is not. I literally can't solve my way out of this problem through my own thoughts, and i'm pretty open-minded. I probably deserve this since in the past i have done some pretty shitty things. but i wish i could move on because i recognize that I am not that type of person anymore.  


Also fuck, in ap psychology i learned melatonin is a terrible thing to take as a sleep aid. If you don't take it the same time every night and go to bed at the right time, it screws up your circadian rhythm which effects sleep and everything. No wonder medicine stopped working eventually, and sleep problems are worse than ever before (aside from depression obviously, but that wouldn't give me weeks of insomnia).

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways, i have kind of given up on life from a non-suicide perspective. Like I won't suicide, but i probably won't do anything either, which might get me kicked out. If i get kicked out, i might suicide maybe, but doing so when family is here to support would be dumb, but like it's impossible to keep up with school. At least i'm a senior so this is my last year. Probably should not have kept suicidal thoughts to myself for a year as they slowly debilitated me i guess, but in fairness i also am pretty open minded to new ideas, so i felt like self help would be an option, and was disillusioned that trying harder would somehow make everything ok, and that moving forward was a necessity, even though i knew base motivation was the problem and no matter what i tried it kept slowly declining.  
I know all my problems effectively, or realize them when they come up, because i am way to self conscious and indecisive (i used to be decisive though), which makes it worse.

This is a pretty clunky rant i guess, idk if i'm one of the only ones caught in this sort of loop rn though or not. I wouldn't call my circumstance exactly common, but definitely not that rare i think. 

If someone read this through I appreciate it because it was a pretty clunky rant which probably took some time to read, and someone understanding and reading it would just make me feel better i think for some reason. If not pretty understandable given the clunky sentence structure lol.

That's why you don't see a way out.,"You don't see a way out because there's no way out. Life is struggling and life is pain, there will be no day in your life that you will wake up without problems and without painful thoughts, just because we are humans and humans are imperfect, EVEN THE HAPPIEST PERSON HAS PROBLEMS and I mean big problems. That's why I think that you should start to accept your thoughts, your problems, etc and live with them, try to solve them but don't let them ruin you.

I've wanted to die my entire life,"Yesterday I got pretty high off an edible.

I can't remember when was the first time I thought about killing myself, but I know it was over a decade ago. I have vague memories of when I was around 5 and I tried to jump off of my balcony one night. That memory lived in my mind as a funny story about how I sleep-walked and how weird and hilarious it was; apparently I was asleep when I tried to jump. My dad saved me. Not a lot of people know this story - or if they do, I only let them see the funny side. I felt confused. Like my memory wasn't my own.

I remember when I was 14 I had a huge fight with my dad that left me in tears. I was left alone in the house. I remember going to the kitchen and desperately looking for a knife. When I found one I pressed the sharp edge onto my wrist, but I didn't let it slide down to cut. I felt shame. Like I was trying to prove something to someone.

This year I attempted for the first time.

It's weird to say ""for the first time"", as if there were more to come.

It was March, before the pandemic. I cut with a kitchen knife for the first time. I had a flashback to when I was 14. I wasn't sure if my intention was to kill myself or not, but I wanted to feel pain and see the vibrant red dripping down my arm. So I did. I just needed to figure out if I needed more. Was this it or was there anything still holding me back? I was standing on the kitchen floor, so I remember walking to my room to lay down on my bed so it'd be easier for my roommates to clean when I bled to death. I didn't do it. I had a moment of clarity and called my mum and cried on the phone with her for hours. I just screamed into the phone, no words, just sobs. We weren't in the same city, so she heard me crying from kilometres away without any way to help. It must have been torture. She called my aunt and uncle who lived about thirty minutes away to check on me. She stayed on the phone with me the entire time until they arrived. I felt guilt. Like I was the worst daughter for not killing myself in silence, but begging for help.

Now I'm doing alright. I'm trying to get used to the idea of being alive. What if it's worth it?

"ok so...i have never written to anyone about this but here is my situation ,,,i need people to reply quick","When I was 13 yrs old and in the 8th grade I was an overachiever in everything- first in studies, spell bee competitions, art, dance, karate, even singing. But i had to transfer from a metropolitan city to a very small city and had to change schools. Yes you are absolutely correct if you are thinking that i could not make any friends and literally went into depression after a year in the 9th grade. Due to this transfer , i was forced to discontinue all my classes like karate and etc...i hated it but i was a mentally strong girl. i joined this school mid semester and still performed outstanding in my academics and i was praised for that by evry1.

the twist of my life came later when everyone had formed their friend groups but no one was interested to involve me in. it was understandable, cuz they had been together for the past 10 to 12 yrs but no matter how hard i tried, i was never a part of anything. being good in academics led to many jealous and rebellious classmates who were always passive aggressive to me. the biggest mistake was to enter a group where i did not belong and then i was given a tag of ""introvert"" even though i was not one. i have no problem with being an introvert but this was wrong. it made me confuse my identity. as time passed by, i began to lose interest in studies i was always worried about what other people will think of me at school. i became a nervous and an anxious student. i could not even raise my hand to answer in the class. i tried to be away from evry1 at school and had my lunch break alone. 

Eventually, my academics went so low my marks were average and below. i did not know what was happening . i got yelled at at home, school and tuition classes for my low marks. so one day , when my mom was out , i was all alone and crying, i took a plastic bag and tried to get away by suffocating myself. i failed to do  it and felt so scared and embarrassed that i quickly hid the plastic bag when my mom came and pretended that evrything was normal.

this happened again .

by the time i got to 10th grade next year i had already committed suicide twice, i used to be depressed most of the time and pretended to be happy. somehow i studied for my 10th yearly exams (they are very important exams) , then this pandemic happened and the exams were stopped midway. thanks to the marking scheme i secured a decent %age. 

but thats not all.

&amp;#x200B;

now i am 16 and in the 11th grade i am studying for my pre medical exams i want to be a doctor, i have dreams...but ..but idk...6 months have gone by and i am not able to perform well i am so scared and anxious and have suicidal thoughts every now and then. and yes i transferred yet again to a different country away from the scary past i had , and i dont want to make this new place a suicide area again ..no... otherwise i wont be able to live in the same room where i had decided to end my life...i did that for a year and it was the most difficult thing ever.. i dont know how many will read this and relate to it...but its just that i want people to talk to ...why am i so fucking alone in this world of 8 billion fools?????

Opened up to my mom,"I'm lucky she tries to be so understanding. On top of this shitty pandemic we're all stuck in, this year I had to move to a new city over three hours away from home for a new job I got after being fired from my old one, I'm financially supporting my girlfriend while she studies to be a nurse here with me, and I had a severe manic episode triggered by the protests that have been happening in my country that made me think I was the successor to Vladimir Lenin 
Which almost got me fired yet again.

My psychiatrist has been switching up my meds lately and the withdrawal from abilify has been the worst of it so far. I feel so much pressure to be performing well so my girlfriend's life doesn't collapse beneath her, and I just can't. A few days ago I thought about ending it all this Sunday night so I wouldn't have to face another day at the fucking office on Monday. I've hated every job I've ever worked and I just know if I kill myself one day it'll be on a Sunday night. I called my mom up and she managed to talk me down from it. She knows I struggle with bipolar and that my uncle killed himself because of it too, so she takes that shit seriously. I'm lucky to be able to talk to her, but my God I felt close to the edge.

This shit has been going on well before 2020 also. Emotionally abused by my dad as a kid, expelled from highschool for a misunderstanding, addicted to psychedelics, injured in a car accident twice, diagnosed with a mental illness that worsens with age, fired, sent to a psych ward, etc. I'm just tired. Everyone says it gets better but I just don't see the light at the end everyone's talking about. A lot of people live long sad lives up until they kill themselves in their 70's.

ISO Angel of Mercy,"As the title says, I am looking for someone to help me pass on. I was recently diagnosed with two diseases and my quality of life has not been good for a while now. I’ve lost 30 pounds and I’m not getting any better. I can’t even stand to look at myself in the mirror. These diseases are killing me and I would prefer to “GO” on my own terms.

"I'm a broken, unlovable person.","I found out today I lost a friend because they had romantic feelings for me. I'm devastated to say the least. But I came to the realisation that im a broken, unlovable person. I have severe trust issues, I cannot ever get into a romantic relationship because I just cannot trust. I will fear they will leave or cheat on me. Now I'm second guessing all of my friendships. Maybe they don't really like me. Maybe they'll break up with me, and im just a lamb waiting to be slaughtered. 

I will never find someone. I just cannot. Not even a friendship, they always fail. I don't know what's wrong with me. I just keep getting hurt.

Quarantine is making me feel suicidal. Help.,"I am a 16 year old kid in high school. I've always been a good student and I've had good grades, I'm not the happiest person in the world because of family and life issues though.
Now that we're quarantined I realized that going to school to have some human interaction was the only thing that kept me a little motivated and happy. Now, I feel worse than ever; I've had my sad moments even when life was normal but quarantine is making it worse. I started skipping online school because I feel too sad and unmotivated to do anything, I feel like a failure. I dont even draw or play my guitar anymore. I don't do anything, I just feel sad. I want to go back to studying but I've missed so many subjects that I don't know what to do anymore. Going to actual school was the thing that kept me motivated on studying and waking up in the morning, but now all i want to do is just lay in bed and cry, because i feel like im a disappointment to my mother who is all alone, my uncle and grandma recently died of covid too.

I have a severe drug addiction and my parents think it’s just my choice and I’m being dramatic/ looking for help.,"My parents think my addiction is solely a choice and that me quitting is me being dramatic and looking for attention.

I’ve had a drug problem for a while. Lately it’s been opioids.  I take them from the minute I wake up to the minute I go to bed. Every day that im alive is living hell aside from the 45 minute buzzes I get.  I’ve quit so many times just to come back. I also mix with other prescription drugs. I genuinely think I’m going to die soon. I’ve been to the hospital 3 times this year. 

My parents have some weird egotistical thing where they ignore it. It’s scary and bizarre. My parents 10 months ago sat through a convo with a doctor about preparing for suboxone and it’s like they forgot. They refuse to believe it’s genetic and they refuse to believe it’s difficult. They’ve called what I’m going through “drama” and looking for attention. My mom always says “just choose not to do the drug.” I wish it was just that simple...

A traumatized chick who just wants it all to end.,"Read post history to get an idea of what has happened.

These past few months have been very hard for me mentally. I had a lot of things happen to me that keep me having nightmares almost constantly, which means I haven't been getting sleep. I recently lost a decent job I had that covered health insurance and seeing a therapist cost me $100 per trip, which I can't afford. I am stuck doing a job I hate for minimum wage and my bills are due soon and I'm not sure how I'm going to cover it all.

My fiance is in a totally different country from me, my friends a two-hour drive away. I told them all I was struggling and needed something to get me out of my head, and so far nothing. It's like they don't care, but I couldn't really blame them for that. There's not much of a decent human for them to care about.

I haven't eaten these past few days because I just don't have the energy to. I'll make the food, but as soon as it gets to where I actually eat it, I get tired and don't want to.

Today I feel really sad,"It's been a wild rollercoaster of events lately, and it's been hard to handle, from my family and life itself making life really unbearable and hard to live, to losing the one and only reason that I've lived for and pushed so far, the person I love. It's hard to fight these suicidal thoughts, and sometimes I really lose will to live, and it's been getting more and more difficult to fight the feeling, the thoughts, and especially the pain of losing you. Recently we made up and agreed to start again, from zero, but it hurts acting so differently and I'm so impatient for us to go back the way we were. You cannot even tell me that you love me, you feel it's too intense at the moment and you barely reply to my messages. I write you lines and lines of text, but you reply as if I didn't even write anything. I just don't know how to react, or what to say. I send you voice messages, but I honestly don't even know if you really listen to them. It's painful to not be able to be by your side, to not be able to hear your voice, to make you happy and know what's on your mind, to not have you say that you love me. Maybe I've been moving too fast, ever since we agreed to start again. I say too much, I express my feelings too much. But how can I not when I love you, and love isn't just expressed in the romantic way, love is being dedicated to you, caring for you and wanting your best more than anything in this world. You're my everything, and I love you so much, you've no idea. But I don't know how to react to what's going on, and it's painful, but I'll do my best to continue being understanding, though it hurts, you still make me just as happy, even if right now it's by thought, since we didn't even talk yesterday.

I want to die but I don’t want the pain,"I’ve tried overdosing 3 times in quarantine but it hasn’t worked because I don’t take or have enough pills because I’m scared of pain or being permanently disabled. 

I don’t know any painless way of dying it’s so annoying, I have new tablets which can make me drowsy so maybe I could die in my sleep if I tried but I don’t want it to not work and upset my parents and grandparents again.

I’m not sure why I’m still here.,"For the first time in 10 years I’m speaking “publicly” as public as this is on a throw away. For about the last 3 years I haven’t been able to wrap my head around why I’m still alive.

My mother was a single mother of four growing up, we lived in the projects of our small town, in a 2 bedroom so our mother in one room, the children in the other. I remember being happy and content with this since I was young and it was all I knew, we had a PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and computer she got from the office she worked in from her boss. She always made what felt like miracles happen on Christmas even though I remember her always stressing about money and working multiple jobs. So I don’t remember having real reason to complain or be upset at our living situation. All of the project housing was very close, community wise and literally in space. The next house over shared the front yard with us, in a square shape we were on the bottom of the square, they were on the right side of the square. We’d play football, kickball and other sports after school or on weekends, it was normal for me to go into our neighbors home, we knew them well my mother would babysit their kids sometimes. I don’t remember how old I was, roughly 8-10 years old, it was around 2 pm I was with a kid that always came around for sports, but I wasn’t sure which house they came from. He was showing me a trick on his bicycle or something and said he was going to get a soda from his place and offered me one so I followed it was just a 3 or 4 minute walk. When we got there his father said they were out but he could go to the gas station and pick some up, I was told to wait there and his son went with him. I didn’t think much of it because the TV was on and this gas station was maybe a 5 minute drive I’ve walked to it before. Someone else came in shortly after and said they were looking for the father, I said they went to the store and I was the sons friend. I don’t know what happened next, I don’t know how this man got my pants off or why I allowed it, I always fought with my brothers and was always vocal, but I froze while this random man molested me. I just remember pain, and blood in my underwear. I don’t know what was put inside of me. It felt like an hour went by but it was probably less than 5 minutes, he randomly stopped and walked out. I looked down and that’s when I saw the blood so I went to the bathroom and cleaned myself up. I began to walk home confused, still in pain, still with this frozen feeling. My mother was on the front porch talking on the phone when I got to my street and she asked me where I was, I told her down the street with a friend, and she told me not to go out of her sight without asking first. The rest of the day is a blur.

About 2 or 3 years later apartments were finish being built about a 5 minute drive from us, and my mother had been seeing a man for a year or so. We ended up moving into them with him, it was first year of middle school. I am now 11 or 12, I knew a lot of people at school, I had a lot of friends, I was the class clown. I had very bad eczema as a baby, and some of elementary school but didn’t remember it much it had cleared up since then. About 5 months into the school year, I got a really bad patchy scab on my cheek, in my first year of middle school when I’m already worried about my looks I remember hating going to school, sometimes wearing a bandaid over it. Not long after my skin was at its worst head to toe, I was pulled out of school to do online classes. From head to toe my skin was red, itchy, scabby, wet, dry, burning, I’d feel my skin rip in spots for moving. Doctors said it was hormonal and I’d grow out of it, some would prescribe steroids quickly and said they should work, some said it’s because of the dust mites in the carpet since the house in the projects didn’t have any carpets and I had to get use to it and I’d heal in time. My mother took a lot of time off of work, just missing work was very costly for her, just to get me to doctors, specialist, 2 or 3 hour drives sometimes. Not a single doctor could help, a new steroid with horrible side effects every other week, “have you tried not scratching, using fragrance free soap etc” common sense suggestions. The doctor appointment that stuck with me the most was during an allergy test, where they pricked my back to see what irritated my skin, and the doctor summed it up as “allergic to everything under the sun” and “top one thousand worst cases in the world” I remember holding back tears, at 11 or 12 years old, until I got to the car just from hearing that. After a long 3 hour drive back home, nothing changed, not a single doctor could help. At one point I was rubbing Crisco on my entire body after every shower, showering felt like hell. Not showering would make my skin even more raw and crusty, I was not allowed to share a room with my brothers because of the scratching noises I’d make in my sleep, or crying from pain when I was not able to sleep at all. I was moved to the couch downstairs, I’d have new sheets every day, because of all the oils and ointments I was using after every shower full body, and all the skin flakes that would come off of me that felt like I was laying in dirt. My mother’s boyfriend would make fun of my skin and call me a “lizard” because of all the dry skin flakes, or call me a “wolf in the night” because my crying sounded like “howling”. She never spoke much to it to get him to stop. My friends from school wondered what was going on, we’d talk through Facebook sometimes. Until we were prescribed a really strong steroid that cleared me up within a week, I remember having so much hope, and being so happy. It cleared me up over the summer, and I started the next school year in public school again. Incredibly happy to see my friends, to not feel pain every day. And about 4 or 5 months into the school year, this happened again. Even worse than before somehow, I wrote my first suicide note without having any plan on how I’d do it. I just felt hopeless, the pain and suffering I felt overwhelmed me every day. Eating hurt because the skin around my lips would rip and burn, showering was horrible, doing any activity or seeing anyone was painful, sleeping was impossible, I couldn’t focus on online classes. They ended up having a teacher from the school come to me to teach me. And it repeated, doctor visits, no medicines or any kind helping, my mother being beat by her boyfriend from time to time, him hitting us with our mother’s encouragement over small things, him breaking our Xbox and Xbox controllers at 12 am when he was losing on call of duty screaming over voice chat, while being 30 years+. This went on for 3 years, my skin getting better, I start the school year in public school hopeful, just for my skin to become horrible again and again, 6th, 7th, and 8th grade. I passed each year, out of what felt like pity, I wasn’t doing well on test, I wasn’t paying attention, I couldn’t do work by myself, I wasn’t learning. 

And just like that, during summer my skin clears up, strong medicine, I’m about 14 or 15 and high school would be next. Since I was always home I had a big online presence, I was always on the landline talking to a friend, messaging on Facebook, or on voice chat. We had a family ipad I would fall asleep using sometimes, in the living room on the couch. My mother would dedicate losing sleep for her 9-5 office job to go through my Facebook messages and question me about them later, she would listen to my phone calls outside and question me. Constantly invading my privacy and making me feel unsafe, she would tell me I’m lying about stories I told to my friends about her boyfriend, lying about stories about abuse verbal and physical. It felt like she was beginning to hate me and I wasn’t sure why. I was the 2nd oldest, but would hit her boyfriend when he hit her. I would always try to help, while in pain already. I remember waking up to him choking her, my siblings went downstairs in fear and just sat there, I went in and jumped on his back trying to help her. I was always loving and helpful. But I was still being treated like shit by her. She wasn’t like this to any of her other 3 kids. Over the summer she left her abusive boyfriend and started seeing someone else, he wanted to move about 6 hours away, we ended up doing this after a couple of months. I was able to say goodbye to friends and begin high school in this new town. All I had were my friends it felt like, I was able to keep in touch online but I felt like I was losing everything. After a few months in school my skin started getting bad but not bad enough to where I couldn’t handle it, we had found an oil with a steroid in it that kept my skin at a moderate level. A few patches but nothing horrible. I was doing horrible in school, as I didn’t learn a lot during middle school because of my learning situations. I didn’t want to be there, I’d breakdown and people would notice. One day I just stopped going, I told my mom I wanted to work on getting my GED, she was against it but I wasn’t going to go back. At this point she’s still listening to my phone calls, hitting me and pulling me off my bed in the morning, constantly gaslighting me, kicking me out then when I find my way back to my hometown by taking buses she calls the police on me saying I’m a run away, so I get taken back. She would lock my shoes in the trunk of her car so I couldn’t go anywhere throughout the day, while telling me she also didn’t want me there, telling me I couldn’t eat the food in her house, etc. we had a court hearing about my truancy from school, and the judge we spoke in front of agreed I could begin adult education classes to get my GED. So I was taking the bus every day for that going to the local college.

I’m 16 now, I visit my hometown and see some friends I haven’t seen in a long time since moving away, I don’t remember how this was planned or how I got there because I was broke and constantly fighting with my mom but I remember being happy. I was with my closest friend I’ll call her K, we always talked on Skype, phone, kept up and talked for hours. I didn’t have a friendship like this with anyone else at this age, able to talk for hours non stop. She stayed with me the longest on my final day there while I was waiting for my ride, it began raining, and since she had to bike home from the coffee shop we were at we agreed she should go before it rained harder. This would be the last time I ever saw her. Every secret, embarrassing moment, happy moment, sad moment, anything in my life, she knew. And vice versa. About 3 months later I get a call from her boyfriend, one of my friends, I set them up since they told me they liked one another privately. Telling me she was hit by a car and flown to a hospital, I’m 6 hours away, 16 years old, broke, with no idea how to see my friend that’s in the hospital. I’m told she wouldn’t make it that night after a couple of hours, her boyfriend put his phone up to her ear while she was on life support and let me say final words. I am completely broken at this point, I don’t know what to think or what to do. I just wanted to be around friends. We were all on Skype the next day or two comforting each other, I got help with money to go back to my hometown and see friends. Attend the service, and try to move on. I ended up moving back to my hometown that year and house hopping. Sometimes homeless, I worked a basic cashiering job I’d walk hours to or ask around for rides.

It’s been six years since then, I watched my class graduate and saw how happy they were. I missed out on a middle school experience, and a high school experience. I see people now finishing college, beginning in med school, law, etc. I’ve worked decent paying jobs for someone without a high school education, and have a few friends here and there. I still talk with my mother online we’ve gotten better since not living together. I live with friends near their college. I have a girlfriend of three years, in the last 6 years I haven’t progressed in any career opportunities, education, happiness, or healing. At the end of the day all I can think about is my past. My skin still gets bad and I still find myself losing sleep and dreading having to shower. I never grew out of it like all of these highly trained specialist said I would. I recently found a medicine that is showing improvement, but I feel it’s still too late. I miss K more than anything, I lost pictures and many messages with her when my mother was going through all my messages, out of panic when I was 14 or 15 I deleted everything on my Facebook, messages, pictures, anything. I can never confront my mother about this I’m sure even now she’d blame it on me. I’ve missed out on so much, I’ve seen all my friends be handed cars by their parents, and easy paths to college and ways to pay for college. I don’t know why I’m trying when I’m not progressing and have no motivation to progress. I have no immediate family I speak to besides my mother online from time to time. I’ve been on my own for so long, and only feel happy when I’m with friends, able to help my friends, able to surprise my friends, able to give heartfelt gifts. I told myself long ago that if I wasn’t going to kill myself I was going to make others around me happy. But it doesn’t seem worth it anymore and hasn’t the last 3 years, no matter how many distractions I give myself, video games, voice calls, movies, at the end of the day all I can think about is all of these things that have happened to me, I mourn the loss of my friend every night, I have nightmares, I am having memory problems, I have this new medicine for my skin that may or may not be helping, it’s to the point where if I hear my roommates in the common area which is right outside my room, I won’t leave my room even if I have to use the bathroom, because I can’t even wear a fake smile anymore.

I have written 13 suicide notes, I have attempted suicide twice, even with my lack of education from school I’ve been a manager everywhere I’ve worked. I have amazing social skills, and am still the funny guy to be around, always making people laugh in any group I’m in. I feel like I have a good head on my shoulders, and I may not be book smart but I am street smart. And not existing through this constant pain and suffering, makes the most sense to me. Even if the cost is upsetting others at this point, it’s not fair to me to live this life for the sake of others. I’m not sure what I’ll do, I’m not sure what the solution is, all I’m sure of is I don’t want to exist and haven’t for a very long time.

TW: I’m giving myself a month. I truly don’t want to do this anymore.,"Note: Copied and pasted from another subreddit. After finding this place, I feel like it belongs here. More than anything. I added some notes at the bottom. It can be removed if it doesn’t belong here. That’s cool.

——

I’m 19. I’ve never had a job and I can’t drive. Getting a job, working, makes me extremely anxious. Driving makes me even more anxious. I feel like you can just die at any moment when driving. I don’t see it as relaxing or peaceful like most people my age do. 

I’m not allowed to leave my home. I don’t even live at home anymore. I live with my grandparent and they’re not willing to help cut off my parents because they’re religious and family is super important because of Jesus and other things. I’m an atheist. I do not believe in any god who can put people through this hell.

As a kid, I was not allowed to see anyone outside of school. No birthday parties or sleepovers. No going to a friends house after school. No seeing boyfriends outside of school. I was always too young to be doing anything. Or I was just too stupid. I’m extremely shy and anxious now as an adult. I will never be independent. 

I can’t leave to have a job, or drive, or see friends (I know we’re in a pandemic but still). I can’t even see my boyfriend of two years without being yelled at. I can’t cut my hair without being cussed out about it. I’ve never even been allowed to cut it. 

And I’m too scared to just leave. I will never leave because I’m paralyzed from the fear. I’m absolutely terrified of what my parents can do. The police will not stop them, especially my father. He owns several guns, has anger issues, and has pulled one out on my mom several times. He’s threatened to kill my pets. He’s threatened to leave me and my mom. He’s always been screaming about how we’re useless and they would often fight, screaming and screaming until they came into scream at me. Screaming in my face about how they hate each other. How much they hate each other. Both of them venting to me about how horrible the other one is. 

I will never leave. I won’t ever be forced to leave, as that’s already happened and I just couldn’t. I couldn’t leave. I’ve been told to leave multiple times but I can’t. My boyfriend has tried to get me to leave and live with him, but I can’t. Several friends have tried to help me leave but I can’t. I’m too terrified to do so. 

I’m thinking about breaking up with my boyfriend, because I’m never going to get out of here to live a life with him or anyone else. He isn’t my first boyfriend but he’s the first to know how bad things are for me. Our three year anniversary is on a Saturday this year and I can’t bring myself to even see him on it or near it. 

I’m thinking about pushing everyone away because they can no longer help me and I can’t keep acting like I’m not jealous of them. They may have bad parents too but they’re not afraid of their parents. They can work. They can drive. They can see people. They can cut their hair and their parents would fawn over them.

I’m in college, sure. I have 2,000 dollars in debt because my family won’t help me by bringing in tax papers I need. I think I’m going to drop out. I can’t pay off that money at all. I feel so stupid for even thinking about going to college. I feel stupid for even starting my classes. 

I’m just truly thinking about killing myself. I have no reason to be here anymore. Every day gets harder and harder. I don’t see any hope of anything getting better. I’ve been depressed and suicidal for years. It’s never been this bad. I’ve never been so scared and alone. I’ve never been more exhausted. I truly don’t want to continue living. I’m not happy. I’m nothing. I just want to go to sleep and never wake up.

I think I’m going to give myself until the end of the next month. I want to experience Christmas and see my boyfriend again before I do anything rash. I’ve been clean from self harm for four years now. I really feel like relapsing. But if I do, my boyfriend will see and I don’t want to worry him about it. I don’t want to bring him more pain than I will. 

I’m just really sorry. I’m just so tired. I’m so drained. I don’t see a point in living here.",PizzaMoonie,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxi5n0/tw_im_giving_myself_a_month_i_truly_dont_want_to/,note copied pasted another subreddit finding place feel like belongs anything added note bottom removed belong cool 19 never job drive getting job working make extremely anxious driving make even anxious feel like die moment driving see relaxing peaceful like people age allowed leave home even live home anymore live grandparent willing help cut parent religious family super important jesus thing atheist believe god put people hell kid wa allowed see anyone outside school birthday party sleepover going friend house school seeing boyfriend outside school wa always young anything wa stupid extremely shy anxious adult never independent leave job drive see friend know pandemic still even see boyfriend two year without yelled cut hair without cussed never even allowed cut scared leave never leave paralyzed fear absolutely terrified parent police stop especially father owns several gun ha anger issue ha pulled one mom several time threatened kill pet threatened leave mom always screaming useless would often fight screaming screaming came scream screaming face hate much hate venting horrible one never leave ever forced leave already happened leave told leave multiple time boyfriend ha tried get leave live several friend tried help leave terrified thinking breaking boyfriend never going get live life anyone else first boyfriend first know bad thing three year anniversary saturday year bring even see near thinking pushing everyone away longer help keep acting like jealous may bad parent afraid parent work drive see people cut hair parent would fawn college sure 2 000 dollar debt family help bringing tax paper need think going drop pay money feel stupid even thinking going college feel stupid even starting class truly thinking killing reason anymore every day get harder harder see hope anything getting better depressed suicidal year never bad never scared alone never exhausted truly want continue living happy nothing want go sleep never wake think going give end next month want experience christmas see boyfriend anything rash clean self harm four year really feel like relapsing boyfriend see want worry want bring pain really sorry tired drained see point living,tw giving month truly want anymore,pizza moon ie,4171,69,pizza moon ie note copied pasted another subreddit finding place feel like belongs anything added note bottom removed belong cool 19 never job drive getting job working make extremely anxious driving make even anxious feel like die moment driving see relaxing peaceful like people age allowed leave home even live home anymore live grandparent willing help cut parent religious family super important jesus thing atheist believe god put people hell kid wa allowed see anyone outside school birthday party sleepover going friend house school seeing boyfriend outside school wa always young anything wa stupid extremely shy anxious adult never independent leave job drive see friend know pandemic still even see boyfriend two year without yelled cut hair without cussed never even allowed cut scared leave never leave paralyzed fear absolutely terrified parent police stop especially father owns several gun ha anger issue ha pulled one mom several time threatened kill pet threatened leave mom always screaming useless would often fight screaming screaming came scream screaming face hate much hate venting horrible one never leave ever forced leave already happened leave told leave multiple time boyfriend ha tried get leave live several friend tried help leave terrified thinking breaking boyfriend never going get live life anyone else first boyfriend first know bad thing three year anniversary saturday year bring even see near thinking pushing everyone away longer help keep acting like jealous may bad parent afraid parent work drive see people cut hair parent would fawn college sure 2 000 dollar debt family help bringing tax paper need think going drop pay money feel stupid even thinking going college feel stupid even starting class truly thinking killing reason anymore every day get harder harder see hope anything getting better depressed suicidal year never bad never scared alone never exhausted truly want continue living happy nothing want go sleep never wake think going give end next month want experience christmas see boyfriend anything rash clean self harm four year really feel like relapsing boyfriend see want worry want bring pain really sorry tired drained see point living tw giving month truly want anymore
So many regrets and mistakes,"I’ve made so many bad decisions in my life and I have so many regrets about them. I’ve hurt people and not apologised because I didn’t realise at the time it was wrong. Some of the things you could pass off as me being too young, but other things I’ve done more recently and I should’ve known better. I’m 20 goddamn years old - why don’t I fucking learn?!

I struggle with anxiety and OCD, and I believe this is what has led to me making these mistakes - I’m so scared of one thing that I do another thing that ends up being worse than what could’ve happened if I did things right the first time. I’m so stupid. 

I want to reset my life, go back to when I was like 3 years old and start again - but with some kind of manual that tells me not to do the stupid things I’ve done. I feel so guilty and so stupid, I have too many regrets and I don’t think I deserve good things because of all the shitty things I’ve done. 

My friends and family think I’m a good person but that’s because they don’t know what I’ve done. I want to get help but that will probably ruin my life anyway - so should I just die?

"Told my bf I was leaving to go kill myself, he went to sleep.","I'm literally spiraling into the depths of multiple mental illnesses; most prevalent, BPD/bipolar 1 combined diagnoses (which also means depression associated with said conditions, anxiety associated, PTSD, etc).  
I know that ultimately, my mental health is my responsibility. I realize no family member, friend or partner is responsible for making me feel better.  That being said, when I talk about my intrusive thoughts and contemplate suicide, my bf says ""go check yourself in somewhere"" or ""I don't know what else you want me to do, we go through this all the time"".  Am I wrong for thinking this is not what you say to someone on the brink of killing themselves?  I honestly don't know.  So tonight was bad.  I basically said I have no want to live anymore and I already have my plan. He said ""if I would've known we'd be going through this tonight, I wouldn't have taken 3 tylenol PMs"" and goes to sleep.  I mean, it was 1am so I get it but...I actually grabbed a knife and left my house and went to my preplanned spot, and just sat there.  The idea was to slit my wrists and give myself some time and distance to make sure I couldn't be saved.  That's the closest I've been to attempting since I was a teenager.  And my bf doesn't seem to understand the gravity of what I'm saying.  It's just me again, being dramatic.
I'm 24 years old. I have two kids, 4yo and 18mo, and I don't even care to live to see them get older.  I love them, and I provide for them.  I work full time, I take my son to therapy, I organize school and bussing and homework.  I take them to the doctor, I take them to see family (well did pre corona) and I kept it all together for them.  I went through the motions of being a good mom.  Until I started dating my now bf, I was a single mom and the kids dads would be parents when they wanted to be, I picked up the slack.  But anymore I just don't even want to go to sleep because I'll end up waking up and having to go through all the motions of the day, and realize how mundane and boring my life is, and how I have no desire to even change it.
 I just want it all to stop. And really the only reason I haven't gone through with it yet is because I am my kids sole provider, and I'll feel guilty that someone has to pick up that responsibility.  Also, I have a lot of debt from my previous marriage and I feel guilty leaving someone to deal with that.   But I also wish someone (my bf is literally my only friend, I have self isolated for the last 3 years) took me seriously.  I wish I felt validated.

"I honestly don't know if this is suicidal or not, maybe a combination of logic and suicide ideation","So I've been thinking through the process of natural selection. In a way, I've come to realize that the reason why narcissism is so prevalent is because it has become a method for those who survive the longest in life. Narcissists are naturally wayyy more resilient to things. It is only logical why narcissism is so common or why people develop narcissistic personalities. Unfortunately for me, I did not develop a narcissistic personality. Yes, I said unfortunately. I've come to the realization that because I am so neurotic, I literally will kill myself at some point. Not now, maybe not in the next 10 years, but I know I won't die a natural death, other than early death caused by accident(s). I just wanted to get this off my chest. I don't know this feeling. I feel suicidal and not at the same time. Ever since my antidepressants started working I've been trying to meditate and practice mindfulness, but I guess for some of us it may never be enough. My personality is fucked, and all I can do is try to change. I usually a really nice person, but when things overwhelm me or if things trigger my C-PTSD, I go haywire sometimes and it just feels out of control. I got into a stupid argument today with my mom over printing a bank statement because it brought back a lot of traumatic memories. I began to berate her because I was so angry at my dad. I basically felt insanely guilty right afterwards and meditated and apologized to her. 

It's strange to not know how much time you have left. I can't really trust my own mind, but it's all I have and will ever have. I think suicide as a phenomenon has its benefits and uses. Other species commit suicide too, so it's not limited to only humans. Suicide solely rules out those who had weak genes or epigenetics that triggered downregulation of genes. This way those who do pass on their genes are typically healthy in some way or another, just not as broken as us I guess.

So I guess, I will try, try, and try to keep living and push positively until that final breaking point. It seems that people typically don't like to see the bottle leaking(me letting my emotions out) once in a while. So why not just let it burst when it does. I think people should stop feeling guilty or making suicide look like a bad thing. It's the human paradox of wanting to ""help"" each other but not being able to even when you want to because healthy people's egos know when to prioritize themselves. This is why we feel that people abandon us and such. People need to protect their own sanity before they lend/share theirs to others, and that's OK.

It funny that when you get to this point in the rabbit hole. You suddenly understand why suicide sometimes seem, ""sudden"" and it slowly begins to feel enticing to join them.

It won't be tonight, probably not this year. 

But as long as these thoughts are here, I will try to fight them and see the positive. Until there are no more positives. Yes, I know everything is perspective. I've lived that, but there's a certain point of understanding where you realize everything is pointless and just feel like giving in. 

Maybe there's a point for us to suffer this thoughts. Maybe those of us that survive to pass of our genes causes epigenetics for out children to be more resilient.

haven't felt this way in a while.,"honestly it's hard and I think I just need to put my feelings into words because they've just been stuck inside my head. 

over the past few weeks, I've had a very overwhelming feeling that I do not want to continue living anymore. For a number of reasons I won't get into. I do not believe that I will actively try to take my own life, but I'm just bogged down with this weight of not wanting to carry on or feeling a reason to live. I know I have reasons I should want to live for but I just can't bring myself to want to live for them. 

The only time it gets really bad is when I have panic attacks, and then i stop myself and try to meditate or listen to music and relax. My fiance has caught on, he asked me what's wrong. I confided in him, I let him know that honestly I feel like i want to die. He was very upset with this and worried. I understand that. He wants me to tell my therapist. I really do not want to. If i tell my therapist she will send me to inpatient and i do not need to be in inpatient. It will make things 1000x worse. 

So, idk what to do or how to make things better. Maybe I'm just stuck with this feeling and i shouldn't tell anyone.

"I'm playing a game without any clear goals, whose rules I cannot comprehend, that is hardly even enjoyable in the first place.","I don't know what the hell I'm even supposed to do with this life, honestly. I don't even know how to conceptualize it. Hell, I don't even know if anything exists outside my own mind, and if it does, whether my mind and internalized biases give anything even approximating an accurate representation of it, let alone how and where any value should be applied to it. I just have no idea what to do with all this. My entire conceptualization of the broader world and the laws that govern it is driven by pure imagination, fueled by the writings of people whom I have never even met. What basis is this for comprehending reality? Not to mention the, at the very best, questionable reliability of the senses, instincts, and memories which, failing the imaginary world I have created from my interpretations of the mythos of my culture, I have no recourse but to rely upon. Even language itself, which is so fundamentally a part of me that it would surely be impossible to banish from my memory, is but my own approximation of the meaning of sounds and markings. There is nothing whatsoever concrete or objective about it, nor is there about any tool I have for interpreting reality, save PERHAPS for the fundamental laws of logic, which are, by some twisted cosmic joke, ever so limited in their applications. There is nowhere I can turn for objective truth. How can one be expected to reconcile such madness, to live with such incoherence, to make any sense of anything whatsoever? It's almost funny, all my life I've lived with preconceptions about reality that had surely been forming since the time I begun to experience, but even these preconceptions are so far outside of my comprehension that I couldn't provide a comprehensive list of them.

"I'm not even sad, I'm just disinterested in life.","I see a lot of depressed people who are very sad. For a long time, I was aggressively sad. No one cared much about my safety or happiness. On top of that, I haven't played my cards well with the women, past or present, in my life. My bones are crooked and quite poor, and I think I just don't have a lot left to do. 

Really, I might be beyond being sad. 

Also, I have begun to suspect I am aware of things humans are generally not supposed to register. 

Overall, selfkilling, or the thought of it, doesn't make me uncomfortable anymore, but life does, which leads me to believe that my fate is already sealed.

idk what sub to post this in.,"yea i kinda had a reality check. sorry if i come across as trying to be funny or shy in this post. it's how i cope.

ever since i was young, very very young, I've had these horribly sexually intrusive thoughts. about everyone. even family. i hated it. i couldn't stand it. i couldn't decipher whether it was normal.

over the years I've just went downhill. i was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes around 2 or 3 years ago, and currently in the process of being diagnosed or null for ADHD. i have horrible anxiety here and there, you know.

i don't wanna be like this.

this is the first time i think ever I'm really truly realizing how shitty of a human i am. wow. 

this isn't overdramatic cliche either. I'd probably be locked away if i ever acted on some of the compulsive shit i think of. 

i can't help it. i wish i could sit down and do school work like a normal kid. i wish i didn't constantly think horrible thoughts.

suicidal thoughts, been there. suicidal attempts and self harm, been there.

that's not what this is about. this is about me wanting to rewire my brain to not think such fucking horrible thoughts. to not consider acting fucking stupid even though I'm too pussy (or smart) to do so anyway. to not be a drug fiend. to not be addicted to anything sexual in any way. being horny all the time gets boring and sad.

to be able to not think of something that scares the shit out of me and not being able to get it out of my head. 

to actually have the motivation to do so.

but you know what? tomorrow is gonna be a different fucking story. I'm going to wake up, forget that I'm breaking down crying right now because i can't balance my sexual life, school life, thoughts, mindset and mentality. 

because I'm fucking lazy. I try and try and try and try everything i CAN to just CHANGE MY VIEW. I have TAKEN LSD BEFORE. and still haven't gotten a single fucking scratch at the surface at trying to change my mind. it's like i jusf don't care.

i WANT to say that I'm being lazy and just not putting in the fucking effort but I TRY AND TRY AND TRY AND YET no matter what i do, the next day just resets everything. i don't want these compulsive thoughts. i don't want to be overly sexual anymore. i don't want to think horrible, gruesome, bloody, or scary thought ON REPEAT 24/7 SIMPLY BECAUSE I CANNOT DO ANYTHING TO STOP IT. people SWEAR that just ""ignoring"" it works. or avoiding the thoughts. or preventing exposure. I've done everything in the book. it doesn't. fucking. work. it's like i see something mildly traumatic and i just, CANNOT stop seeing it in my head. 

same thing with sexual stuff. i am so overly sexual sometimes I'm scared for my mentality. 

I just....it's like my mind has no limits. it will do anything to make me uncomfortable and anxious. I'm over it.

I think I'm forced to kill myself due to my bad behavior,"I had a mental breakdown a year ago. I used to smoke way too much weed and cigarettes and I ate extremely unhealthy too for 9 years. On top of that I had just lived life without thinking clearly and just lived in the moment. I became suicidal. My mind was set on killing myself. 

Then I contact my ex who I dumped and she blocked me. In some random, dumb, depressed, idiotic, life-ruining impulse I made a new account and wrote extremely suicidal texts to her. She said she had improved a lot and I said. 'Fuck improving. I'm done with life. Pointless bullshit anyway. You still want my cat?'...

After that she got angry. I start to explain it. She engages, but then blocks me. This happens like 8 times. After a while she says 'you didn't change a bit and only went backwards'. Then I reply that I did change because I hit the gym 6 times per week, eat extremely healthy, quit smoking, graduated and starting my career. That's her cue to explode. She writes an extremely mean message filled with hate, disdain and degrading stuff. 'You'll never learn how to live your life' 'Loser' 'Whiner' 'This is the same irrational behavior as at that concert when you were arguing with random ppl'... She also told me she would never reply again. 

Then it becomes chaos in my head. It was already chaos, but after that it just went overboard. I hate those insults so much. They repeat in my head all the time. I can't cope with it. I'm too emotionally weak already. I struggled to recover from my suicidal thoughts and this on top of it was too much. 'You'll never learn how to live your life'... Constantly repeating in my head. Flashbacks to arguing at that concert. Feeling even worse about myself. 

Initially fucking HATED her! She was 8 years older and came into my life and I never asked for it and then she can't even bring herself to end it without a bunch of insults that are so toxic for my mental health at that time! So I was fucking angry and wrote insulting messages back in the beginning. 

After that I changed though. I started to realize that I was in the wrong. I changed my tone and began explaining all the time. Begging to talk it out. I did this for like 4 to 5 months because I couldn't think of anything else. In the end I wrote an extremely personal e-mail to her workmail that got forwarded to her co-workers in which I called myself a piece of shit and more dramatic stuff 😓 I fully took the blame in that one. I still had one weak moment and wrote another message like a month later to her LinkedIn and that was it. 

I hate myself. I can't believe that this has happened. I hate that this is part of my life story. I feel like I should kill myself. What the fuck??? Those messages are also black on white. They won't disappear. She can expose me 10 years from now. I've officially ruined my life by being a crazy, deranged and idiotic stalker because I couldn't deal with those insults.",Vapo3030,3,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxib4r/i_think_im_forced_to_kill_myself_due_to_my_bad/,mental breakdown year ago used smoke way much weed cigarette ate extremely unhealthy 9 year top lived life without thinking clearly lived moment became suicidal mind wa set killing contact ex dumped blocked random dumb depressed idiotic life ruining impulse made new account wrote extremely suicidal text said improved lot said fuck improving done life pointless bullshit anyway still want cat got angry start explain engages block happens like 8 time say change bit went backwards reply change hit gym 6 time per week eat extremely healthy quit smoking graduated starting career cue explode writes extremely mean message filled hate disdain degrading stuff never learn live life loser whiner irrational behavior concert arguing random ppl also told would never reply becomes chaos head wa already chaos went overboard hate insult much repeat head time cope emotionally weak already struggled recover suicidal thought top wa much never learn live life constantly repeating head flashback arguing concert feeling even worse initially fucking hated wa 8 year older came life never asked even bring end without bunch insult toxic mental health time wa fucking angry wrote insulting message back beginning changed though started realize wa wrong changed tone began explaining time begging talk like 4 5 month think anything else end wrote extremely personal e mail workmail got forwarded co worker called piece shit dramatic stuff fully took blame one still one weak moment wrote another message like month later linkedin wa hate believe ha happened hate part life story feel like kill fuck message also black white disappear expose 10 year officially ruined life crazy deranged idiotic stalker deal insult,think forced kill due bad behavior,v apo 3030,2910,56,v apo 3030 mental breakdown year ago used smoke way much weed cigarette ate extremely unhealthy 9 year top lived life without thinking clearly lived moment became suicidal mind wa set killing contact ex dumped blocked random dumb depressed idiotic life ruining impulse made new account wrote extremely suicidal text said improved lot said fuck improving done life pointless bullshit anyway still want cat got angry start explain engages block happens like 8 time say change bit went backwards reply change hit gym 6 time per week eat extremely healthy quit smoking graduated starting career cue explode writes extremely mean message filled hate disdain degrading stuff never learn live life loser whiner irrational behavior concert arguing random ppl also told would never reply becomes chaos head wa already chaos went overboard hate insult much repeat head time cope emotionally weak already struggled recover suicidal thought top wa much never learn live life constantly repeating head flashback arguing concert feeling even worse initially fucking hated wa 8 year older came life never asked even bring end without bunch insult toxic mental health time wa fucking angry wrote insulting message back beginning changed though started realize wa wrong changed tone began explaining time begging talk like 4 5 month think anything else end wrote extremely personal e mail workmail got forwarded co worker called piece shit dramatic stuff fully took blame one still one weak moment wrote another message like month later linkedin wa hate believe ha happened hate part life story feel like kill fuck message also black white disappear expose 10 year officially ruined life crazy deranged idiotic stalker deal insult think forced kill due bad behavior
Depressed With My Girlfriend,"So I’ve been dating my girlfriend for 9 months. Before we dated I had the biggest crush on her, she was my dream. Towards the end of my senior year in high school we finally connected and started doing things. I was cleaning things up with my ex at the time so she was not fond of it and stopped doing stuff w me because I had another girl. Yet She knew how much she mattered to me and after us having sex for the first time she ended up having sex with a guy who had a girlfriend on the boat after she wouldn’t do stuff with me because I was finishing up with her. It makes me feel like a backup option and as if she was just using me for my attention and care. She knew I would do anything for her. Eventually, a few weeks after we ended up getting together officially. She’s the best girlfriend to me and she makes me the happiest man in this world and I desire to be with no other girl. Never have I cheated on her. She’s never done anything wrong, aside from lie to me about this guy she used to fuck 3 different times. I don’t know if this goes for other guys, but for me her past, and the idea that other guys were inside her just hurt me so much. It kills me to the point was where everyday I just wanna Jump off my building because I only want to love her but I suffer so much because of her past. I bring it up to her sometimes and talk about it but it really doesn’t help me. She’s a depressed person too so it’s very hard on her when I do bring it up. At this point I feel like I need to kill myself, I don’t imagine myself with no one else, but I can’t bare the fact that other guys have been inside her before me.

Does the fake feeling ever go away?,"I didn't plan for life after 17, my plan was to be dead.
I was 19 when I overdosed on prescribed pain killers after a surgery.

Now, I'm 23 doing things with my life that in theory should make me happy. Right? 
Working out, forcing myself to go to friend events ( on zoom, I'm suicidal but not an idiot ) and be part of things, going to school, taking antidepressants, working out daily, seeing my family, doing motivational pep talks and shit. Like actually trying for several months.

But it feels so fucking fake. None of these things have taken away that feeling that I was only meant to live 17 years.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm not really sure why im posting here, i dont want to get better and there is little to any hope to get better but I dont really care. Maybe it has something to do with wanting to have an impact on other people or something social that has been deeply rooted in our genetics.

I don't know what's wrong with my brain.,"I suffer from bipolar disorder. I don't know if that is relevant here.  
For the past few months I've developed a problem. Day to day I am incredibly unmotivated and bored with my life, until I get the idea to do something, then for anywhere from 2-48 hours my life only revolves around that thing. It's all I want to think about, it's all I want to talk about and my life only consists of working towards that thing until ultimately, my brain has chewed up and spit out all the serotonin I get from that idea and then I don't care about it anymore.   
Sometimes it's gotten so bad that the moment I realize I've lost interest I become massively suicidal and angry because I'm no longer getting the good feelings from that thought. Today that thought was selling some paintings, (I've been making art for 15 years, but seldom sell it) and after making one half assed painting in a medium I'm honestly not super familiar with, I became extremely dejected and upset about how much I hate my art and myself for making it.   
Not just that, I'm used to hating my art and myself, but i got out of bed to put the painting up to dry and two of the corners came off the edges of my mattress. For some reason, this was the last straw, and i didn't even know we were counting. I became filled with genuine full blown rage and began throwing things around my room, yelled, and punched the wall after fixing the sheet. For about 5 minutes all i wanted to do was kill myself because i felt so useless. 

Basically, any minor inconvenience barrels me into an unwarranted rage and the intense desire to dead myself.

There is literally no rational reason to continue living when my life always gets worse and I'm powerless to make anything better.,"My closest friend died back in May this year, and he was the only person motivating me to write and helping me find new people after my heart's been broken since 2018.

&amp;#x200B;

No one loves me. I'm a misanthropic autistic reject of humanity, ostracized for being the uncivilized barbarian that I am.

&amp;#x200B;

Constantly told that I should be locked up for the rest of my life because of how violent I appear. Locked up in the psych ward where I'm restrained to a bed for the next few days. I constantly think of revenge against hospital staff who tormented me, and friends who betrayed me, used me, threw me under the bus.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing is real. Everything is fucking fake. Does anything really exist? Yes, but I don't want to exist anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I live in a province in Canada that's just a fucking lot like America now that our premier and his dumbfuck petrofascists and redneck supporters are privatizing our healthcare system.

&amp;#x200B;

It's too fucking expensive to get mental health treatment anymore. It fucking costs money, and it already stripped me of my sanity and morality. I fucking hate everyone and trust nobody anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I want all of human civilization to just collapse and fucking burn already. Be a post-apocalyptic marauder if I don't kill myself, so someone can just fucking put me out of my misery already.

&amp;#x200B;

I want nothing more than oblivion. I don't want to exist anymore. Whatever alien/advanced AI ""god"" or gods created this shithole universe are sadists worse than any mortal could ever be. Deceptive alien psychopaths if there's anything beyond our material existence, pretty sure they like to pretend to be spirit elves through DMT as well. Maybe that's why I've never enjoyed psychedelics. I see through the bullshit beyond the veil and the sadist alien gods don't like that.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking refuse all afterlives and reincarnation if any of that spiritual mumbo jumbo exists at all.

&amp;#x200B;

Love always betrays. Will never reconnect with my boyfriend who threw me under the bus as my mental health deteriorated as I failed to find the right help... just locked in the revolving door of the psych ward system.

&amp;#x200B;

My tormenters can enjoy their shallow ""victory"" over how defeated I am. I'll be dead and sparing myself the fate worse than death we all created for ourselves as this fucked up worthless species called humanity, and I'm glad we're going extinct. I hate you all.

&amp;#x200B;

I'll finally be at peace in death. I plan on going out with either fentanyl or running a dirty old car in a closed garage, it's supposed to be peaceful.

&amp;#x200B;

I just want my tormented soul to rest. I'm painfully aware that for how much I wanted to be loved in return, at best I'll only be manipulated and used, and given ""tough love"" to fuck me up even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Love and beauty... what treacherous fucking deceptive lies and tools of manipulation and coercion it all is.

&amp;#x200B;

Miss me with the OpTiMiStIc NiHiLiSm as well. You guys are literally just a virtue-signalling cult of grinning martyrs.

&amp;#x200B;

Nothing is worth anything. I should have been aborted, I wish there were screenings for autism so my torturous life never would have begun to begin with. Never had a father in my life either, just my dumb bitch of a mother who neglected me, and then my gullible idiot grandmother. Fuck religion for destroying my intelligence I thought I had... if I ever really had any to begin with and wasn't just a know-nothing know-it-all from day 1.

&amp;#x200B;

You all made jokes of me getting molested by my special needs teacher and gossiped and spread rumours about how I'd become a mass shooter. I even gave up my gun license and now you cunts slander me as a potential rapist. I hate sex, and nothing I could do even with how sadistic I am now, you all create your own suffering. I don't have to do shit because all your lives are fake and ready to topple like a house of cards once we wipe out our own biosphere, when there's no more food being delivered to your grocery stores, when you can no longer get healthcare, and so many calamities that you abominable hairless human apes deserve.

&amp;#x200B;

You all deserve death and extinction. That's the only redemption any of us will ever find, is our inevitable deaths.

&amp;#x200B;

Why not speed it up? I fucking hate the fact I was ever born to begin with. And don't bother me with stoicism because I'm a broken emotional trainwreck all the fucking time, as much as I wished I was just an emotionless stonewall.

&amp;#x200B;

I fucking hate everyone and everything. Nothing and no one is worth suffering for.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm ready to fucking die. I'm already dead inside, aside from growing rage without friends to keep me in check. You'll all throw me under the bus when you can't pretend to help me anymore. You're all selfish, deceptive cunts.

&amp;#x200B;

I will die next year, or you all will regret the monster you all drove me into becoming. I have no fucking empathy for anyone anymore with how much you bastards gaslights me and treat me like shit, and expect me to be calm and docile so you can manipulate me and backstab me even more.

&amp;#x200B;

Fuck you all. Fuck all humanity.

&amp;#x200B;

I don't care what fucking damn well happens anymore or how much I hurt people anymore.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm lonely because I'm an unsociable arse, and no matter all the therapy I'm going through right now, I can't be rehabilitated. You all invalidate me and call me lazy anyways.

&amp;#x200B;

Pain has become a placebo in the absence of all pleasure.

&amp;#x200B;

I only live to spite you all. But why even bother? It's all fucking useless. Fuck all your mind games of dominance to justify all your fucking narcissism. All 8 billion of you human bastards.

&amp;#x200B;

Why the fuck am I even writing and posting this shit? There is no real help.

&amp;#x200B;

And as I explained above, I'm not fucking going to the psych ward EVER AGAIN. And I'll know if you're actually listening to me or not if you recommend I be hospitalized again. You never helped me but betrayed me to going back into the corrupt and abusive mental health system, just to make yourselves look like better people than you actually are.

&amp;#x200B;

I'M FUCKING SAD AND ANGRY AND LONELY ALL THE TIME AND I JUST WANT TO FUCKING DIE. WHY IS THAT SUCH A BAD THING TO LET ME DIE INSTEAD OF KEEPING ME ALIVE TO FESTER IN MY OWN GANGRENOUS MIND.

&amp;#x200B;

Therapy isn't helping me, it's making me worse as usual.

&amp;#x200B;

Meds don't numb me anymore.

I dont wanna be here anymore,"My life has became 10x more boring, meaningless, and wasteful since i moved during quarantine. I literally have no friends because i do online school and the only person i talk to in real life is my dad and family members sometimes. I really don’t like my dad’s side because theyre all really bitchy now, but i just assume it’s cause theyre old and have kids now. I just wish life could go back to how it was, I miss my old friends and all the fun stuff we would do. I’m failing school, unmotivated, severely depressed again, incredibly insecure and just want it all to stop. Everyday is the same, i wake up, nap or stay up playing games, smoke weed, and fall asleep. Repeat over and over and im sick of it. Music isnt fun anymore, weed isnt fun, games arent fun, nothing is the same anymore. I really hope this is just apart of being a depressed teenager, or else I might leave early.

Reaching out is so damn hard for me.,"I'm falling down this hole, once again for the 100th time in the last 13 years.  I have two people to talk to, occasionally three when he desides to have a working phone, but most of the time I isolate myself. It's easier that way, because if I do break, and I'm afraid that I will, the less they lose the less they will hurt. Today my friend saved me in knowingly from writing the fatal note. He didn't know and he never will, he just showed up to take me out for a drive like we've done so many nights. Before he showed up I had been sitting curled up in a ball in my shower so no one could see or hear what's happening to me. It'd better that they don't know just how bad it is, they don't understand that getting help is as hard as it is. ""Just talk about it."" They say, but when I explain to them the last time I had done that I was told I was just a spoiled little brat. By a professional. Even when I try to talk to my dad about it, he doesn't really listen. My sister doesn't care, all she's worried about is her cosplay. My friend I tell this to doesn't help, the only thing I get from her is ""I feel that, geez, damn."" I know she cares she simply doesn't know how to deal with my bs. So I guess this is me reaching out for the first time. The thoughts are getting too loud now to ignore, whenever I drive I have the urge to end it all. I go into a store and I immediately panic, whether it's the abuse I suffered at the hands of men, or whatever else is wrong with me. My dad's angry because I'm ""not trying hard enough"" but I cook and do all the shopping despite wanting nothing more than to cease existence. I don't know if I would kill myself or not, but if a car was speeding towards me I don't think I would move.",oddly-placed-brick,6,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxhnw9/reaching_out_is_so_damn_hard_for_me/,falling hole 100th time last 13 year two people talk occasionally three desides working phone time isolate easier way break afraid le lose le hurt today friend saved knowingly writing fatal note know never showed take drive like done many night showed sitting curled ball shower one could see hear happening better know bad understand getting help hard talk say explain last time done wa told wa spoiled little brat professional even try talk dad really listen sister care worried cosplay friend tell help thing get feel geez damn know care simply know deal b guess reaching first time thought getting loud ignore whenever drive urge end go store immediately panic whether abuse suffered hand men whatever else wrong dad angry trying hard enough cook shopping despite wanting nothing cease existence know would kill car wa speeding towards think would move,reaching damn hard,oddly placed brick,1728,36,oddly placed brick falling hole 100th time last 13 year two people talk occasionally three desides working phone time isolate easier way break afraid le lose le hurt today friend saved knowingly writing fatal note know never showed take drive like done many night showed sitting curled ball shower one could see hear happening better know bad understand getting help hard talk say explain last time done wa told wa spoiled little brat professional even try talk dad really listen sister care worried cosplay friend tell help thing get feel geez damn know care simply know deal b guess reaching first time thought getting loud ignore whenever drive urge end go store immediately panic whether abuse suffered hand men whatever else wrong dad angry trying hard enough cook shopping despite wanting nothing cease existence know would kill car wa speeding towards think would move reaching damn hard
maybe life just isnt for someone,someone said that life is important. It's a very lucky chance for everyone.You must treasure it. But if life is just... horrible for you? I gone through many things that I feel like god just want me to go away. A uncureable disease killed my father when I was 12.I tried changing my personality over and over and nothing worked and I ended up screwing myself over cause I don't even know what I am anymore. Treasure your friends they say. All the time when they will ever say something about me is making fun of me. He cross dress alot! why don't you just wear girls uniform already? He's so sleepy? what's the point of you being here? Piss off... these words.. they could be making fun of me.. but I am unsure.. well maybe home is a safe place.. right? It never was.. everything I said leads to a dead end when me and my family is eating dinner.. the lesson that teaches me Japanese Chinese are not working for me... what the point of me being here? Life is suppose to be fun right..? or st least something for you to enjoy right? at least one thing? or something? I can't find anything I want to enjoy at all.. I wish I can disappear and not leaving a trace so all of my family can move on without a weird disfigure child like me.

"Isn’t it weird how even when everything is amazing, I still want to die?","Despite having a couple of bumps and potholes here and there, my life at the moment is pretty great. I’ve overcome a lot of challenges, built up a nice resume, passing my classes and working towards a career that I like. I’m going to one of the best universities in the states. Working out since the summer has paid off well and I’m proud of how I look. Technically, everything right now is almost everything I or anyone else could want.

Yet— I still see suicide as an inevitability. It’s been 4 years since my first suicide attempt at 15, where I tried to hang myself with my favourite scarf shortly after my birthday. Ever since that day, it’s almost like I look to the future and can only see my end in suicide, no matter how great things get or how content I feel. I simply don’t see anything in any potential future that really excites me or motivates me. It seems horribly arrogant to say when we have such a colourful, beautiful and incredibly complex universe, that I find no interest in it, but that is how I feel. At this point, I think suicide has become a logical solution to a philosophical conundrum of sorts. Or perhaps, I am just bound by fate to kill myself. 

Or maybe it’s genetic? I guess suicide skips a generation since my grandpa went and killed himself when I was a kid. 

These days, I sit around quietly planning my inevitable end— if my congenital heart condition doesn’t do me in, then by forty I’ll probably die by my own hand.

Given up,"I'm ready to die now. It won't be this year hopefully. Next year will the year I take my own life. I feel it. I know it deep down. I've started to write and plan for it. 

Not much going on in my life and it's really too difficult for me. I have a few friends who don't want to see me go but, I can't handle the stress of life anymore. 

I'm 32 years old and i'm tired of life. I feel old and worn. I'm one of the fittest people you can ever meet and right now that counts for nothing. 

My mental health has been in decline for the past decade. I'm sure I suffer from bipolar or somewhere on the spectrum.

I'm sorry for the few that I have and will let down eventually. I have a handsome and smart son and even that isn't enough  to keep me in this world.

I hardly get to see him, spend time with him. I'm a horrible father, friend, son, brother, nephew. I'm a human being who has given up on life.

I constantly self mutilate. Constantly searching for answers. I know I have inspired people to do good. I have done good in this life. That's about the only solace I have in this miserable existense.

As my mental health declines so does my circle of friends, family and lovers. I don't need this torment anymore.

I just need help. I feel like I have no one to talk to.,"This is about to be a super long wall of text, so here's a quick TLDR. **TLDR: I'm a burnt out university student and I feel like I can't take all this pressure anymore.**

I've been feeling terrible lately, even suicidal for the first time in awhile. I thought that maybe posting about my struggles anonymously to Reddit would make me feel a little bit better.

I'm 20 years old and a junior in college. I'm about to turn 21 in February and I just feel like there's nothing left for me. I've exhausted all options and I have no potential. My freshman year was awful and my grades dropped to a 2.1. I managed to tough it out and get a 3.05 last semester, but I honestly think I'm going to fail some classes this semester due to the fact that I've had chronic insomnia my whole life and it makes me sleep throughout the entire day most of the time. Thus, even though I've done all my homework and had good grades on exams, I still will fail based on attendance. I've emailed all my professors and they say they understand, but I know they can't do anything for me because that would be unfair to the other students they have (ie: the students who aren't fucking worthless wastes of space). I've tried everything I know how to do to manage my insomnia, but nothing helps. I feel like there's no point in carrying on if I can't even sleep like a normal fucking human being.

If my GPA drops again, I have no choice but to kill myself. My dad will cut me off financially and I won't have anyone to cosign my student loans anymore (in most cases you need to have someone to cosign). I won't be able to afford going to college anymore, not even a cheaper school, and without higher education I won't be able to make anything of myself. I feel like I'm destined to repeat the same unhappy lives that my parents and grandparents have led. My only purpose in life was to be an anchor baby for a toxic relationship, and that purpose has been served, so there's nothing else left for me to do in this life.

The fact that I can't sleep due to anxiety is only making my insomnia even worse. I should feel like I'm on top of the world right now-- I'm attending my dream school, I'm in the marching band, I just joined a sorority with lots of new friends who say they care about me and like hanging out with me, and I have a boyfriend, a roommate, a best friend, and two siblings who I consider my best friends and my only true family. I know they would be devastated if I was gone, but even that can't hold me back anymore. I stopped taking my medication and I bought a lot of OTC stuff to combine with the multiple bottles of meds that I still have. I've done my research and I'm pretty sure this would work.

The insurmountable pressure of knowing that I'm about to lose everything I've ever worked for is killing me inside. How is it that I'm so close to getting my degree, but I managed to fuck up again and now I'll never get it? It feels like my death certificate is all but signed. I can't even look in the mirror without crying. I try talking to my boyfriend about this stuff sometimes but even he doesn't know the whole truth of it because I don't want to make him worry about me-- the same goes for my roommate, best friend, and siblings. I can't tell my parents because my dad doesn't believe in depression and thinks that therapy is just a waste of time and money and my mom would just make me feel worse. I just can't handle the pressure anymore, even though I've tried. Nothing helps anymore.",susesudo,1,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxjduh/i_just_need_help_i_feel_like_i_have_no_one_to/,super long wall text quick tldr tldr burnt university student feel like take pressure anymore feeling terrible lately even suicidal first time awhile thought maybe posting struggle anonymously reddit would make feel little bit better 20 year old junior college turn 21 february feel like nothing left exhausted option potential freshman year wa awful grade dropped 2 1 managed tough get 3 05 last semester honestly think going fail class semester due fact chronic insomnia whole life make sleep throughout entire day time thus even though done homework good grade exam still fail based attendance emailed professor say understand know anything would unfair student ie student fucking worthless waste space tried everything know manage insomnia nothing help feel like point carrying even sleep like normal fucking human gpa drop choice kill dad cut financially anyone cosign student loan anymore case need someone cosign able afford going college anymore even cheaper school without higher education able make anything feel like destined repeat unhappy life parent grandparent led purpose life wa anchor baby toxic relationship purpose ha served nothing else left life fact sleep due anxiety making insomnia even worse feel like top world right attending dream school marching band joined sorority lot new friend say care like hanging boyfriend roommate best friend two sibling consider best friend true family know would devastated wa gone even hold back anymore stopped taking medication bought lot otc stuff combine multiple bottle med still done research pretty sure would work insurmountable pressure knowing lose everything ever worked killing inside close getting degree managed fuck never get feel like death certificate signed even look mirror without cry try talking boyfriend stuff sometimes even know whole truth want make worry go roommate best friend sibling tell parent dad believe depression think therapy waste time money mom would make feel worse handle pressure anymore even though tried nothing help anymore,need help feel like one talk,use sudo,3493,55,use sudo super long wall text quick tldr tldr burnt university student feel like take pressure anymore feeling terrible lately even suicidal first time awhile thought maybe posting struggle anonymously reddit would make feel little bit better 20 year old junior college turn 21 february feel like nothing left exhausted option potential freshman year wa awful grade dropped 2 1 managed tough get 3 05 last semester honestly think going fail class semester due fact chronic insomnia whole life make sleep throughout entire day time thus even though done homework good grade exam still fail based attendance emailed professor say understand know anything would unfair student ie student fucking worthless waste space tried everything know manage insomnia nothing help feel like point carrying even sleep like normal fucking human gpa drop choice kill dad cut financially anyone cosign student loan anymore case need someone cosign able afford going college anymore even cheaper school without higher education able make anything feel like destined repeat unhappy life parent grandparent led purpose life wa anchor baby toxic relationship purpose ha served nothing else left life fact sleep due anxiety making insomnia even worse feel like top world right attending dream school marching band joined sorority lot new friend say care like hanging boyfriend roommate best friend two sibling consider best friend true family know would devastated wa gone even hold back anymore stopped taking medication bought lot otc stuff combine multiple bottle med still done research pretty sure would work insurmountable pressure knowing lose everything ever worked killing inside close getting degree managed fuck never get feel like death certificate signed even look mirror without cry try talking boyfriend stuff sometimes even know whole truth want make worry go roommate best friend sibling tell parent dad believe depression think therapy waste time money mom would make feel worse handle pressure anymore even though tried nothing help anymore need help feel like one talk

It’s hard trying to hold composure when your moods are consistently up and down. 
     So I’ll write the vulnerability down.
Writers are pretty transparent, you can see our attentions, any opportunity that arises for us such as these days when we feel gloom . . . It makes fit for a novel. “One about ourselves.”
 I thought this out Maybe that novel is worth it after all, just vanish not let anyone know. It just shows people that a writer can also be the actress of there own damn novel. 
      I’m just a writer, some cannot handle that. I’m going to make something out of the pain the vulnerability I feel.

My heart hurts,"Let me start this out by saying that I'm not going to commit suicide. I have a daughter who is the same age that I was when my dad passed away and knowing how losing a parent was at least part of what fucked me up for life I absolutely cannot do that to her.

Right now my daughter is crying because the squirrel who comes and sits in the tree in our yard when she plays outside got run over by a car and she found him like that. They had been friends since the summer and she named him Stanley. She is inconsolable and I'm pretty broken up about it too tbh. I'm sorry if this sounds selfish or something but why did that need to happen to my daughter? Seeing her grieving just makes my already horrible mental state so much worse.

I'm not really doing her any favors by staying alive, since I'm literally just a sad sack who breaks down sobbing between 8-12 times a day, at home, in public, literally anywhere. But having the empty shell of me here seems to comfort her so I guess I have to stay, at least physically.

It's not going to get better. Even if the circumstances that make me feel this way change for the better, they can always change back again, plus I have zero coping mechanisms despite medications and intensive therapy. I'm super afraid that I will live a long life and not die until I'm old, and that thought fills me with dread. I can't take 50ish more years of suffering. I used to look forward to the future with hope, now that the man I love is gone all our plans have been ruined, my 20 year life plan is useless, I am useless now and a waste of space. When I hear about people who passed away I don't even think ""oh, that's so sad"", I just feel jealous because they got the one thing that I want so badly. I'm sorry because I know how insensitive that sounds but life is just like a bad dream that I can't wake up from. 

Yes I know it's trivial to be suicidal over a significant other, but I am, and I don't like it any more than anyone else does. Plus there are a whole host of other contributing factors but losing my boyfriend of 6 years and consequently all the stability and security of the life we had planned together was the straw that broke the camel's back. Not to mention seeing my daughter break down over Stanley today felt like a million knives twisting in my chest.

Goodbye. So long. Farewell.,"I’ve had severe endogenous depression since I was diagnosed at 10. I’m now 25; they have me on experimental levels of medication being studied by the NIH to keep me alive and mostly from killing myself. The only thing I asked of them was to stay as numb as possible. I never want to feel again. The side effects are true hell but not being on them is a truer fate than a lifetime in hell. 

Everyone I know is just trying to keep me alive but I don’t want to be alive anymore. I’m begging everyone around me to just let me die. The only person I ever loved or wanted a life with left me because of my alcoholism which took two periods of detox, both which almost killed me. 

The only way I’ve been able to cope with her loss is to hate her, I’ve drilled it deep into my soul that I hate her, I have never hated someone like this. Unfortunately deep down I know it’s all my fault. I put alcohol before her. I put it before everyone. I’ve spent two months of my life in bed since she left and I rarely see anything but doctors and a mild walk at best. I’ve begun to have neurological issues where some days I can’t walk or move. Honestly I don’t wanna walk or move because it feels like I’m treading the edge of death and I’m begging for it to pull me under and never let me back up. I don’t believe in god but if there was one I’d already be dead the sick fuck.

I left what I consider my home, my state, everything I’ve built in my life. Because I’ve come to hate this place because of who I am and what I’ve lost here to it.

Weeks I went without eating, 10’s of pounds lost, many a night sitting with a blade in my hand just trying to pull that fucking trigger. I haven’t been able to yet but I will, I know so deeply I don’t want this anymore. I’ll never want this anymore. I was destroyed by myself and the only person I ever truly loved. This is not a request for help.

"I feel like I can't make it through every day without getting hopelessly discouraged about myself, and I'm circling suicidal thoughts.","I've always felt alone, I have good set of friends, and some that would offer help if I asked it, but I don't think they are the naturally compassionate kind, and outside of a few of my immediate family, I feel starved of love. Compared to a few years ago, I'm miles better in my life situation, I have my own place, bought my dream car, have a job where I enjoy the people I work with, but I can't seem to find ambition to love myself. I see my life here as temporary, so a passing thought at becoming something significant in the cultural norms seems irrelevant, insofar as I have enough for myself not to be starving and can stand up on my own. I've never had a serious relationship, and within the last few years have definitely retreated into myself, I can't confide in my own true nature because I'm too deterred by insecurities, simple things I feel as if I already have the ability to fix given some effort. I don't want to sound verbose, but something in me, just instills a natural doubt over myself, and it looms heavier after each instance of it, like some call to the void. Perhaps its covid, or something from my past depressions, but I can't really remember being really happy, I can recall many times I've have jovial conversations or enjoyed the lack of seriousness in a moment, but not honestly sit there and thank God for satisfying my dailiness, and I'm ungrateful, and every day seems like a missed opportunity better taken by someone else.",Duhssert,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxiher/i_feel_like_i_cant_make_it_through_every_day/,always felt alone good set friend would offer help asked think naturally compassionate kind outside immediate family feel starved love compared year ago mile better life situation place bought dream car job enjoy people work seem find ambition love see life temporary passing thought becoming something significant cultural norm seems irrelevant insofar enough starving stand never serious relationship within last year definitely retreated confide true nature deterred insecurity simple thing feel already ability fix given effort want sound verbose something instills natural doubt loom heavier instance like call void perhaps covid something past depression really remember really happy recall many time jovial conversation enjoyed lack seriousness moment honestly sit thank god satisfying dailiness ungrateful every day seems like missed opportunity better taken someone else,feel like make every day without getting hopelessly discouraged circling suicidal thought,duh sert,1461,134,duh sert always felt alone good set friend would offer help asked think naturally compassionate kind outside immediate family feel starved love compared year ago mile better life situation place bought dream car job enjoy people work seem find ambition love see life temporary passing thought becoming something significant cultural norm seems irrelevant insofar enough starving stand never serious relationship within last year definitely retreated confide true nature deterred insecurity simple thing feel already ability fix given effort want sound verbose something instills natural doubt loom heavier instance like call void perhaps covid something past depression really remember really happy recall many time jovial conversation enjoyed lack seriousness moment honestly sit thank god satisfying dailiness ungrateful every day seems like missed opportunity better taken someone else feel like make every day without getting hopelessly discouraged circling suicidal thought

"Hotlines are a joke, and the United States is a mess, why stick around?","I know I shouldn't say that because I'm sure they've helped many, many people. But they've never helped me. The suggestions they always give are things like, ""maybe you could take a walk, listen to your favorite music, take a nice warm bath"". I've called so many times to get these types of responses. So I always feel angry when those hotline numbers are listed like the rest of the world can't handle it and they can't, I know.  


Why are the answers to call a hotline or ""get help""? I'm arguing with myself here because I know the answer is that people just aren't equipped to deal with me, so they have to push you off on professionals that can handle it, but has anyone had a professional that's handled it? Anti-depressants, benzodiazepines, anti-psychotics... meds have made my life more difficult, especially benzodiazepines.  


I'm just sick of searching for the light when I'm this way. People mean well but most will never understand the amount of pain it took to get to this place. And if you're in the states, we're a country that's divided and cannot handle a pandemic. I think Trump was right about one thing, suicide rates will rise. The only thing is a lot of it is because of him. Letting people who were racist, homophobic, xenophobic, etc. come out of their shells and speak freely. Hasn't anyone else lost empathy because of this? When I'm losing empathy for other human beings, I've already lost.  


Why would anyone want to keep going in a world like this? On top of EVERYTHING else we have to deal with, why stick around for *THIS*?  


I don't understand the point. I've lost so much empathy. I can't even feel love anymore. I can't appreciate what's beautiful in this world.

I’ll finally be free.,"I have struggled with mental health issues since my early teens. It plagued my life. Then the white hot pain of sexual assault, addiction, and domestic abuse followed. All misery, just different kinds. I hate myself and the way I treat people, especially the latter. This may sound melodramatic, but I can’t remember being sincerely happy since I was a child. I have no hobbies or interests. Nothing to look forward to. I laugh but it feels empty. I lack intelligence, I feel so dull all the time. My boyfriend broke up with me- not that this is his fault- but it cements the fact that I have never ever positively influenced anyone in my life. 3 years. He knew everything about me and decided that he could not tolerate it anymore. My family will miss me, I know this, but they will undoubtedly live without me. I know it sounds selfish, but I have caused them a great deal of pain in the past and will only continue to do so. My plan is to go out as peacefully as possible. I am getting my hands on a lethal amount of heroin and injecting it before my ex gets home. I will lock my bedroom door and slip a piece of paper under it that says “call 911” so he will not have to see the body. If there is a god, I pray for forgiveness.

“You’re not alone” doesn’t help me and I don’t know why anybody thinks it will,"I don’t understand why people say shit like this, along with lines like “other people have it worse” “things always get better” “you don’t have it so bad”

Like, how do people not understand that this shit makes me feel WORSE? I already know I don’t have it as bad as other people! That just makes me feel even shittier because I should be seizing the opportunities I have, but I don’t. Keeping myself from spiraling down even further is like a full time job, leaving me no time or motivation to do anything else. 

I don’t see how I can possibly move past this when I can’t even bring myself to have a basic daily self care routine. I feel like I’m working my ass off and moving literally nowhere. I’m 30 with no job, no money, no girlfriend (or friends in general), and no self esteem. 

I’m a fucking manchild who still has to be supported by his parents. I constantly see and feel the judgement of people when they start to piece together my life and realize I’m just a fucking loser. I was never as smart or capable as I thought, I was just really good at faking it. But now people can see that I’m really just a pathetic piece of shit and nobody wants to be around me anymore.

The one thing I had left was my looks and now that I’m going bald, that will fade away soon too. I’m so lucky to have parents who offer to help, but they’ve already spent so much on me that I just feel fucking pathetic making them do anything else for me. I can’t stand leaving the house now and I’ll put off simple tasks like getting groceries for weeks, rationing my food and sorta starving myself until it becomes unbearable and I work up the courage to go outside.

Everyone I get close to fucking leaves me and I’m sick of building up relationships just to be broken down over and over again. This shit is fucking dumb and I really don’t see the point in putting myself through all this suffering just to inevitably end up with a mediocre life. This wasn’t how shit was supposed to go down.

I just wish my parents weren’t around so I didn’t feel so bad about killing myself. They’ve already lost their only other kid, and I can’t put them through that pain again, especially when I have a choice. But I just don’t see how things will get better.

I've been too weak and stupid to make something good out of my life for a very long time, and a lifetime of regrets are surfacing in my mind now. I just don't see any hope anymore.

It’ll happen soon,"I’ve brainstormed pros and cons of different suicide methods and ultimately decided on the ‘good sleep’; that being pills and alcohol. My only issue is that I don’t have any connections to get Xanax or anything of the sort, especially considering I’m still a minor. Alcohol is obviously much easier to get, so I don’t have to worry about that.
I know that I’ll feel calm once I acquire what I need. The thought that I could end it all whenever I’d like, in the case that it would work, somewhat eases me.
Though I’m worried I’ll have to do something else if the pills/alcohol combination doesn’t work. I don’t want to have to jump face first off a bridge, though it’s almost a guaranteed death if I do that, but my body would be completely mangled and I don’t want to put people through that.

Getting closer,"I made my plans a little while ago, as time goes on nothing is changing but the knowingness that it’s happening soon. I emailed my therapist yesterday and thanked her, and cancelled the rest of our appointments. Last month, I cut out most of my friends and family. I haven’t spoken to anyone but my employer, roommates, brother, and boyfriend in a month. But with them, I’ve been pretty open and honest about what I’m experiencing, so it won’t come as a surprise. 

I had thought about faking my death, as not to offend or hurt anyone else. I thought about going on a long hike, and killing myself far off trail in the woods so nobody can find me. My family would be distressed for a bit, but probably more at peace thinking it was an accident. But I’ve realized that actually... nobody is too phased by the concept. I’ve been posting on instagram and Snapchat that I am literally planning on killing myself soon and the response is very accepting, if not supportive of my decision. Some people will say “reach out if u need me!” but I can’t tell if they’re joking or not... you’re commenting that on a post where I wrote “please, anyone help me.” If they’re not joking... that’s so lazy that I’m almost offended? And if they are, well haha! 

I was considering sticking around so I didn’t make my little brother’s depression worse, but he expressed to me himself that he plans on committing suicide soon without regard to our family. I don’t think he needs me as much as I thought he did. I asked my mom if I can borrow her gun next week and she said yes, but I’ve been walking in and out of my closet all day messing with belts and ropes. At one point I slipped with a belt around my neck and thought “oh wouldn’t this just be rich” before my hanger rod snapped. 

I keep hoping I’ll tell the right person or say the right thing that can fix it all and make life the better option here, but there’s just nothing I can say. Nobody knows how to swallow something this big. I was molested and raped starting when I was a baby, and I have CPTSD now from repeated abuse, assault, and so much mental manipulation that I can’t even discern reality from feelings anymore. I don’t want to have panic attacks every time I wake up. I literally vomit every single morning because I’m so physically panicked when I come to reality. My reality- every aspect about my life- makes me panic. I don’t want to be here. I can’t work anymore. The government doesn’t think mental illness is real so assistance isn’t an option. Nothing makes me happy. I can’t eat. I’m sleeping all day. I’m starting to give away my instruments and art supplies. I can’t use them anymore.

"So many things said, so many things done....","...it never gets any better.

My life started with misfortune and it only kept spiralling.
What little memory I have of *my*self, I grasp onto, I act out in my head, where it is safe, but it only makes the lack of feeling and enjoyment in the real world all the more noticeable.

My illness over three years brought pure misery upon me, stripping me from all I held dear, naked, pure.
Each day, suffering, uncertainty, how long will I make it? Why me? What have I done?

But one thing it gave me: Time with myself, a period of contemplation and alone conversation, pure isolation.
A monologue, starved off any emotions, any outer factors, just myself.


I used my last bit of energy and luck happened to be in my favour, I found a diagnosis, salvation, I thought.

Surgery, my body was opened, people carefully mending my vessel, disfiguring my once beautiful body as a byproduct, one of the few things I was happy enough with to not be pained by it, despite gender identity issues.
But if that was the price for my life, so shall it be, I was more than happy to pay it.

A magic mountain, high above it seemed like, beautiful, until I realized I was at the very bottom of it, having tumbled down to the foot of the giant I once tried to conquer.

Waves wash over me, all the emotions coming back, all the pain, now realized, fully processed, I feared this would happen, my sober, starved self foresaw this.

Yet I was there, weak, feeling worse during my recovery than I was, I felt ungrateful, horrible, why was I not happy?
So much laid ahead of me, but at the same time, nothing, my family urging me to get out, no connection with former friends.

I had experienced things nobody I knew had, as if I spoke a different language.
Yearning for love after a lifetime of abuse, was probably natural, my body and my soul hurt, I wanted a soothing warmth to comfort it, all those nights in pain, physical and psychological had left me starved, damaged, seeping the precious blood of confidence I had managed to accumulate prior to my downfall.

Online I met someone, the urge of my family, and the urge of decisions led to me fleeing my country, the negativity, the bad and good memories in an attempt to start over.

I was mistaken, immaturely I had acted and now pay the price for.
In this country, I do not feel at home, but nor do I in my home anymore, everything falls apart.

Who I love turns out to be different than I hoped, I love them, and yet, it hurts, my previous words of caution regarding sex had not worked, I was damaged, now even my sexuality in shards, cutting my brittle skin.

All words out of my mouth, falling into the void.

My identity, soul, sexuality, stripped, squeezed into a form, recycled into something more desireable.
Their words of comfort don't reach me anymore, I try to hear, I try to smile and ease their fears, their sadness, but I can't help but break and yearn for the touch of someone who doesn't hurt, who understands me.


Myself, the only person I can truly still love and trust, but can't be alone with anymore.

I don't want to be this facade and yet... I have lost my self.

Like an urge to rip my skin off, I can't be like this anymore, I want to get out of here, I feel ashamed, humiliated by everything, present, memory, the things to come.. every touch, every word, it shames me.

And yet I depend, unable to provide for myself in this land, in this state, wanting to love but struggling to.

I feel like I was responsible for someone's (potential) suicide.,"So a bit of backstory, this took place over a Discord server at 3 in the morning. The people involved were me, the person who committed suicide in question, and her friend (whom I am also friends with)

So I was on the server talking to the mutual friend and generally having a very relaxed time when the person in question joins the call. The mutual friend tells me that our friend slit her wrists and is bleeding badly, so immediately my first aid training kicks in and I tell her to find something and apply pressure to stop the bleeding.

""no""

The friend and I beg and plead for an entire hour, I tell her she needs to stop the bleeding, that it wasn't worth it and that she needed to let someone know this was happening. We both told her she needed to tell her parents, but she refused on grounds that her relationship with her father was practically abusive. We continued trying, reasonng as desperately with her as we could, but no matter what we said, all she said was ""no"" and ""I'm done with this life guys"". I continued to desperately beg and reason with her, and as this was 3 in the morning and I was bloody exhausted, what I meant as ""don't do this, don't die on a Discord server..."" came out as ""Don't do this here..."" I immediately realised what a massive fuckup this was, as it sounded so bad, but it was too fucking late. She instantly leaves the call and me and her friend start panicking. We immediately start spamming her and calling her and telling her to come back. As this is happening, I submit a report onto Discord's trust and safety team with her user details.

She still hasn't responded and I'm assuming the worst right now. I'm just a kid (16M) and I wish I went to sleep earlier. I don't think there was anything else I could have possibly said and done but a part of me blames what I said out of pure exhaustion and I wonder if I could have said something else which could have saved her. I feel horrible and guilty right now and responsible for her death.

It just all feels so surreal...I wish there was more I could've done or said... but noone knew enough about her other than her country (no one knew her real name either)... it just feels so hopeless and I hate it.",throwawayselfblame,0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/SuicideWatch/comments/jxig2g/i_feel_like_i_was_responsible_for_someones/,bit backstory took place discord server 3 morning people involved person committed suicide question friend also friend wa server talking mutual friend generally relaxed time person question join call mutual friend tell friend slit wrist bleeding badly immediately first aid training kick tell find something apply pressure stop bleeding friend beg plead entire hour tell need stop bleeding worth needed let someone know wa happening told needed tell parent refused ground relationship father wa practically abusive continued trying reasonng desperately could matter said said wa done life guy continued desperately beg reason wa 3 morning wa bloody exhausted meant die discord server came immediately realised massive fuckup wa sounded bad wa fucking late instantly leaf call friend start panicking immediately start spamming calling telling come back happening submit report onto discord trust safety team user detail still responded assuming worst right kid 16m wish went sleep earlier think wa anything else could possibly said done part blame said pure exhaustion wonder could said something else could saved feel horrible guilty right responsible death feel surreal wish wa could done said noone knew enough country one knew real name either feel hopeless hate,feel like wa responsible someone potential suicide,throwaway self blame,2204,64,throwaway self blame bit backstory took place discord server 3 morning people involved person committed suicide question friend also friend wa server talking mutual friend generally relaxed time person question join call mutual friend tell friend slit wrist bleeding badly immediately first aid training kick tell find something apply pressure stop bleeding friend beg plead entire hour tell need stop bleeding worth needed let someone know wa happening told needed tell parent refused ground relationship father wa practically abusive continued trying reasonng desperately could matter said said wa done life guy continued desperately beg reason wa 3 morning wa bloody exhausted meant die discord server came immediately realised massive fuckup wa sounded bad wa fucking late instantly leaf call friend start panicking immediately start spamming calling telling come back happening submit report onto discord trust safety team user detail still responded assuming worst right kid 16m wish went sleep earlier think wa anything else could possibly said done part blame said pure exhaustion wonder could said something else could saved feel horrible guilty right responsible death feel surreal wish wa could done said noone knew enough country one knew real name either feel hopeless hate feel like wa responsible someone potential suicide

"What do you do, to distract yourself from your thoughts?","Firstly, I would like to apologise for those who have it so much worse. I hate coming out like this when I’m well aware in comparison to what could be, I’m not in that bad of a situation. But by heart and head can’t be stopped and this time I accept I am only human, so please, don’t see my cry for help the wrong way. 

I’m 27 years old and I don’t want to get into my sob story, but once again I’ve found myself to be so lost and alone. I can fill you in on a little of what’s happened.

I’m surrounded by people on social media but it doesn’t help me at all because I don’t ever actually see these people. I’ve lost of the heart of my life mate and my daughter moves away out of country again with the grasp of her mother. 

I sold my good life back in Scotland and moved to Germany to be a father to my 1 year old daughter after her mother and I split up in Scotland and then was cheated on for 2 years until I realised what was happening, from there I stayed in the country to be her father and eventually I found love again. A true deep love. 

But it’s been 2020 and it’s knocked the hell out of us and it’s finally destroyed us. Now what comes next in June/July will be my daughter being taken away by her mother to go live with the man her mother cheated on me with. 

Germany isn’t so bad but I struggle to speak the language and I got in a lot of trouble for punching someone who attacked me, they ruled it was self defence but the injury was so sever I was classed as a dangerous weapon and charged anyway, €4000 by the city and €13,000 by the mans compensation (a court case I wasn’t even allowed to go to and no lawyer would accept me because they “couldn’t speak english”.) so I’ve been left without money for quite some time and I have to deal with xenophobic people every single day because I’m a foreigner. 

It seems there will be nothing left for me here. But jobs in Scotland now are none existent so going back is almost a certain failure for my career and life. Most of my friends have all gone their own way and I don’t speak to really anyone at all. 

I’m an ex army veteran of five years and one tour of Afghanistan. That led to many attempts of suicide from 2014-2016, I managed to recover by the love of those around me I endured. 



All in all, I’m alone. I have nothing left to give and the ability to gain nothing. The love I have is unwanted or not good enough. People want my body on social media but no one actually wants me as a friend and companion. Each country I look at to start fresh looks like a failure waiting to happen. I’ll be replaced as a father and a lover. 

Now all I have is 4 walls to look at, with nothing but blank misery in my future. I went onto google and searched “what stops you being depressed” then “what stops you wanting to kill yourself”.

I’m constantly thinking of ending my life.

I have so much things just bottled up inside of me. So much shitty thoughts I want to tell ANYONE but I can’t fucking do it. 

I have cut and self harmed in the past and it’s devised the people in my life, made them think it was there fault and basically caused a domino affect all because I fucked up. 

I noticed this and changed myself, stopped the self harm and one day just thought positive. This kept up for 3 months before all the bad thoughts like “I’m worthless” “I can’t do anything” “Im nothing like the people around me” all shit like that. Started comparing my self to people quite a lot, even when it made no sense to. 

I keep this all inside tho. Kept this reality up for the people around me thinking I’m okey. But I’m about to lose it. I’m going to exploded it’s going to end really shitty. 

People are always saying that I’m smarter have potential and can learn shit really well but that means NOTHING WHEN I CANT EVEN PUT EFFORT IN THE SMALLEST THINGS. IM USELESS AND A WASTE OF ENERGY.

Peaceful ending to a hard year,"I've decided that I will end my life. After years of struggling with depression and emptiness, this year has by far been the worst. I thought my younger years when I attempted to take my life and ended up in hospital were the worst years but 2020 takes the cake.  


After studying and getting a degree I have found it impossible to get a job after sending off hundreds of applications, even to jobs that don't require degrees like stacking shelves and those sorts of jobs. It's got me really down but that's only a small part of why I feel the way I feel today. I also have to go to court for drug driving where my license will be taken off me. I have let my family down. I have let myself down. My dad is disabled and my mother cant drive. They've given me the world but I haven't given anything to them except for sadness and hard times.  


I've spent most of my life since my teenage years trying to make up for all the bad things I've done. I try and help out the elderly in my local community and I try my best to be an approachable person for others who need help and assistance. I tried to get a degree in something that will directly help people. Now with a criminal record and no license I will not be allowed to do any of these and it has killed the life force in me. I want to do good but the universe doesn't want me to.  


Before I go I want to say thanks to for letting me say how I really feel and thanks to all the lovely people who give their time to helping others in any way.  


I never wish I had a different life. I just wish to stop living completely.

I want to kill myself to protect the people I care about,"This is gonna sound backwards, but I've realized a long time ago my brain doesn't work logically anyway. I'm a bad person. I don't ""think"" I'm a bad person, to me it's a fact. I could get into all the details, but I'll keep it brief. I do bad things that I know I should stop doing, but I never do. I actively choose to do things I know are bad. I feel bad about doing it, but I never actually change. I know my friends, family, and girlfriend all care about me, but I feel like they don't know the real me, the shitty me. I care about these people in my life but I don't treat them how I want, and I never change to treat them properly. I honestly feel like it would be better if I was gone, so I could protect them from me. I feel like I'm a danger to them, not physically, mentally. I feel like I cause problems for all the people I care about. Not only that, but I have problems myself that are getting worse and worse which just makes dying sound better and better. I protect the people I care about, and my issues are gone as well. It's more about the first part though, my issues just go away with it too.

Everyone and everything has given up on me and I am in unbearable pain,"&amp;#x200B;

Everyone. Therapist, my parents, etc. Today my abusive, narcissistic mother was like, ""Why don't you just get married and get out already? I want to have a smart grandchild i can raise to be like me instead of a failure like you."" 

I know I'm a failure. I couldn't even graduate high school despite wanting to. i couldn't achieve my dream of becoming a writer. i wish I was anyone but me. i hate myself. i want to take a knife and cut my face and wrists and my body because I'm a disugsitng person and I need the physical proof of it.

I'm tired of seeing the person who sexually molested me as a child and not being able to go anywhere because I'm unemployed, broke, codependent my mother, low self esteem, and stupid. stupid as fuck. I'm tired of this 

She said it in  a joking manner but it got to me.

There are a lot of other things. But I honestly cannot take this pain anymore. I am giving myself a week. If my new medication doesn't work, I will steal some of my molester grandpa's vodka and down my antidepressants and try to slit my throat. No one listens and no one cares. 

My stupid DBT therapist says its because I don't try the fucking skills enough. My life is shitty. I'm a toxic person. I am in an abusive relationship with myself. I keep hoping I'll change and things will get better and deep down inside I'm a good person, but I'm not. I'm anything but good.

Tired of fighting the good fight and keeping up appearances.,"I (F) have been battling mental illness since my teen years and I am almost 35. I think even as a child I was more sensitive than most. I always thought I’d die from this or self destructive behaviours. Yet I LIVED. With no family support I ever remember having. Rape and sexual assaults. Physically, emotionally, and mentally abusive friendships and relationships. Many personal losses, alcoholism, and a love of cocaine. I got my life together though. Seemingly. People think I’m a survivor and I’m open about mental health on IG but truly I’ve been planning on giving up. 

Yes I have no more addictions. Beautiful place of my own. SUV almost paid off. Work out 6 days a week and take care of my appearance meticulously. Great employee with a government job (albeit low paying and soul destroying I’ve smiled through it.) Outwardly I seem like I have it all together. I seem like a catch. It’s all just a mirage though. Smoke and mirrors. The cracks have begun to show at work and I’m no longer able to fake I’m ok. On my days off I don’t want to get out of bed and often times don’t. I started out anxiously puking up my food to deal with my mental health spinning out of control and now I just don’t eat at all. I seem friendly and kind on the surface but a confusing diagnosis between either being BPD or having CPTSD means I destroy all the healthy relationships I have. Especially romantic ones. 

I have no trust for others because I believe myself to be too much. I believe that I am inherently unlovable and considerably toxic. I test those I love who may love me but they get pushed to the point that they can’t anymore to protect their own peace. I’ve had so many bad relationships that have broken me that I now break down potentially good relationships because my mind tells me people are bad and out to hurt me. When I realize how good they are it’s too late and they are gone. I just did this and the person I’ve loved most, ever, just said it would be best if we never saw each other again. I begged but he’s right that my insecurity will always test us. No one has ever made me feel seen, and as accepted as him and I still pushed him to his limits. I don’t see any hope for my future. Not romantically. We are in this world where a lot of people are just looking to get laid or put on false pretences while they dishonestly date others behind your back. That’s all I experienced before him. I felt like just some hole to play with and it was really demoralizing. I felt like a shell of a person and I can’t go through that again. Please don’t tell me I should just work on myself. I’ve done a lot of work. I’m tired. I have one true friend that checks up on me but if her relationship was happier I’d probably have zero support. 

I want to say you really don’t know what demons inhabit someone’s mind. The constant shame of just existing can reside in anyone regardless of looks, status, or how their life may seem. Sometimes being grateful is just not enough when you feel alone. I appreciate any messages and I applaud those of you who selflessly take the time to offer support on here. It’s just that I want supportive people in my area and I want true love. I have decided my course of action within the next 24 hours. My home is staged like a Christmas open house. I have a cute outfit to be found in. I deleted and cleared out all my social media which went back to 2007. I am about to write my note and have a plan. I’m mostly at peace with this decision. I feel it’s time. I haven’t had any sign from the universe yet tonight that I shouldn’t go through with this but the only person that could probably talk some sense into me is my ex who will not be contacting. I feel bad that work will wonder where the heck I am on Monday and leaving them short staffed. No one really checks on me so I know it will be awhile before I’m found and I feel bad for the person who does. My only fear is of failing and ending up just messed up but still having to live. Other than that though I just feel ready for whatever’s next.

I'm in a Very Dark Place Right Now,"On the outside, I look calm. But, I am literally battling every second to try to stop myself from having a panic attack and a mental breakdown. 

Everything I worked for was for nothing. Everything. I'm in medical school and I just bombed the most important exam that will determine the course of my career. I've been preparing for this exam non-stop for the past three months. I went into the exam feeling like I did my best. I finished the exam feeling pretty good. I was confident that I did ok. So, when I saw my score yesterday, I almost fell to the floor. I barely passed. Like literally just one point above failing. I needed a good score to keep my doors open. Now, I am screwed. I am absolutely screwed.

I put myself under so much pressure to prepare for this exam. I tried to make connections. I got involved in research and published important articles just to fet my name out. I pushed everyone around me away. I lost the love of my life because I was overbearing on her. All of this to end up with such a horrible score. 

I have a history of cutting myself and the urge to pick up the razor again has never been stronger. I can't sleep because my heart keeps pounding and I keep imagining myself hanging from the ceiling. It sure feels like a very attractive option right now, although I know I'm too much of a coward to actually pull the trigger on myself. While driving to work this morning, I thought of intentionally speeding and ramming my car into the wall. I want to disappear from the face of this Earth. I want to be put out of my misery. I just can't accept the fact that I'm a failure and deserve nothing good my way. 

I would like to consider myself a fairly religious person. I prayed regularly and believed in pre-destination. I always thought that I just had to do my best and be a good person, and somehow things will work out for me eventually. Well, I'm starting to feel like a fool for ever believing in that. For the first time in a while, I stopped praying. The only praying I'm doing right now is for God to take my soul and let me rest in peace. 

Everything I did has been for nothing. I have no fight left in me. I just can't reason myself out of this. This was my last chance and I blew it. It's all over. I lost everything. I'm a failure and I just don't know how I will ever be able to face myself or my family again. I failed everyone that loves me.

I had a happy dream for once and it made me more sad than the constant nightmares,"
I used to have constant nightmares. all of them upset me or make me anxious in various ways but a few nights ago I cried after waking up from a happy dream.

in this dream I made up with a friend who I fell out with a while ago and we went on vacation to a place where I always wanted to go. I was with my two favorite people i've ever felt close to and loved by and we got to explore my dream vacation place.

I had no responsibilities and no money problems, just me and my two favorites living in the moment laughing, running around, and around, and having tons of fun.

I woke up and it fucked me up immensely thinking I could never make that a reality. i'll never be that happy or have that because i'm inherently disgusting and stupid and gross and no one wants to be around me and they shouldn't have to put up with me because I wouldn't

I've Had A Breakdown And Can't Move Forward,"This is my first ever post on reddit and I've been struggling with myself all day on whether or not to post this.

I've always suffered with mental health issues but once I met my girlfriend everything got so much better in an instant. It felt like I actually mattered to someone and it seemed like we very quickly fell in love.

This whole week has had me at the lowest I've ever been. I had dropped her off at work on Saturday morning and she kissed me and told me she loved me. On Sunday she was very quiet and distant then on Monday morning she broke up with me by text and ignored me all day.

Halfway through the day I started drinking and planning out my suicide. I had a note written out and a noose ready. I knew that my dad was coming to see my on his way home from work so I wanted it to be a final goodbye. However a friend I had confided in had called an ambulance and I was stuck with him around all night.

I just want my intelligence back.,"Over the past 17 years of my life, I was very intelligent with multiple people at school and at home commenting on my intelligence. I was a high achiever at school constantly getting excellences and getting merit endorsement last year I knew so much about history but that all gradually changed over the last couple of months I'm now very forgetful, it's so difficult to think right now, and now I just can't remember fucking anything. I'm a shell of a person and now I perpetually feel like shit every day and in some days I just want to fucking kill myself.  Fuck My Life. The brain fog also makes it such a chore to study when I used to somewhat enjoy it go figure, especially in the middle of exams

Hi,"Today I have decided that my life will end by my own accord.

The moment someone reads this, I´ve left precise instructions of what should be done with my goods, and with my body, a testament of sorts.

I´ve been so broken, so alone, so sad for so many years now; it´s time to end it all.

There is, unfortunately, no precise date for this event; as that´s not up to me; regardless, there is no more than two years left for me, from the time I post this, ´till the day of my demise.

"It will always get worse, it's inevitable","I barely have the strength to write this post. When a day goes well, I feel so happy, it's mostly when my social life is going well. But it can never last a full week and things start to go bad. People always have there ways to get to me and today I lost someone very close. I've been suicidal for a long time but I keep it hidden well. The only problem is how it delays my ability to socialize. I apparatus don't look sad or anxious. So I guess I come of as an unsocial loser. My life is pretty complicated but basically, I've always had this one friend who I've been able to trust. It wasn't just me and her, she had other friends who some were mine but I could never trust anyone like her. 

Eventually she couldn't put up with me anymore and she left me. She just stopped including me, texting me and talking to me. She ignored me when I talked to her and started to avoid me. It's happened so much in the past and I've only just started to trust again. I was starting to trust her, her and my 'friends'. But no. They ditched me because they couldn't stand me. I'm just a hinderance. I'm sorry for my existence.

i’m tired of feeling so fucking alone,"i’ve been working on a sexual violence essay (that’s supposed to be 10 pages, so i have to do very thorough research) and researching this topic has brought back a lot of unsavory memories of my childhood. i was sexually abused by a family member when i was 7 or 8, and i couldn’t tell anybody for years. on top of that, my family wasn’t at all nurturing, and i’d get made fun of for crying or showing any kind of emotion. i didn’t realize that being raised that way hurt me so much until i started doing research about attachment styles, like how your attachment with your caregiver as a child impacts your future. i have a fearful avoidant attachment type which means i want so badly to experience true love and deep, honest intimacy with somebody, but every time i get anywhere near that, i break it off before it can go any further. i reject people before they can reject me. i have always broken up with people and cut off friends because i would find one fatal flaw in them that i couldn’t live with. but now that i’m realizing my lack of genuine connections is due to the way i was raised, i resent my parents and siblings. they were all so cold to me, and never really asked me how i was honestly feeling. i’ve grown up believing that my feelings make me weak, so i never truly show them to people, and if i do, i completely regret it, and i distance myself from the person i told. i just feel so guilty and disgusting all the time and i can’t tell anybody because nobody FUCKING cares. my friends couldn’t understand what i’m going through because they weren’t sexually abused as children, so how could they understand the shame i’ve carried around for my entire life? my friends and family always make fun of me for cutting people off so quickly but now that i know why i do it, i’m so angry that nobody was able to help me through these difficult times. nobody tried to check in on me, nobody asked me what i wanted, nobody gave a shit. when i told my mom 1 year ago that i was depressed, she screamed at me and told me it was bullshit, since she’d never seen me depressed. at this point, i’m starting to feel like there’s no real reason that i should continue living. i’ve been having dreams about dying and they put me at peace. i don’t care about how my suicide would affect the people in my life, because they would only care about be after my death. they didn’t care for me while i was alive, so why should i protect their feelings? i’m 17f, and during this time of applying to colleges and deciding where i want to take my life, i feel stagnant. i don’t know what i want to do and my mom doesn’t believe i can make money through art. nobody wants to give me the benefit of the doubt, nobody wants to listen to my embarrassingly suicidal thoughts, and nobody gives a shit about me. what’s the point in trying to heal my trauma if it will take me a lifetime?

I am trying not to have a hard time,"I'm sure you guys will go through my history and determine that I am a neurotic headcase. That's true in a sense, but I am a decent partner overall.

She seems to be happy most of the time. When I tell her that I am having a hard time, suicidal thoughts, or stressed out she turns against me. Last night she came into our place and caught me on the suicide hotline.

She went to the kitchen and complained about my cooking. I asked her to talk about the phone call and she went to the bedroom and locked the door. I was sitting on the couch in an emotional teeter totter. Deserve to kill myself, or will the pain I inflict on my family be too much?

We have a rule where we don't talk to others about personal matters unless we explicity say that we want to. It's a little relationship quirk, but it's very important to me. I started to get concerned calls from a lot of contacts. It was very embarrassing to say the least.

The trust violation has really hurt me. Today we went for an outing that she was really looking forward to. I felt hurt about the past and sort of afraid because she has been violent and has lied publicly about me to diminish my character in the past. I lost my dream job because she falsely accused me of constraining her to an isolated location. She wasn't even working and I paid for her vehicle, mma training sessions, and all other expenses.

She had her MMA friends beat the shit out me. It was a terrible, dehumanizing experience. That was our initial break up.

A few months later she calls me because she is pregnant with our son. I decide to man up, swallow my recently bruised pride, and take care of her and my future child. That requires me to end my employment and move to a state that I hate.

Tragically our son dies. I may have not loved the circumstances that brought my son into my life but I loved my son. I will forever be scarred by the memories of giving him CPR when I knew that he was dead.

I know the taste of cold baby blood forced into my mouth during CPR. That is impossible to forget.

A few months later my role model sister hung herself in an RV. About 90 days from todays date.

Disturbed saved my life.,"I don’t know if this is the right place but I needed to get this out. 


45 minutes ago I was in my car with the engine on, window cracked in my garage. I was writing a goodbye letter to my daughter. 
I googled how long it took and the first thing that popped up was the Suicide prevention line. I didn’t call it, just scrolled on by to get an estimate. 
I sat there and wrote and listened to music and then I got an even worse headache, dizzy, sleepy, calmish. I kept asking myself is this what I want. Do I really want to do this. Whenever I would panic and think of opening the garage or turning my car off. I would chastise myself and just tell myself it would be over soon. 
I started thinking of my daughter(who is at her grandmas) and my pups(they’re 6 and 3 and my babies). And then I started worrying that they might get poisoning as well cause they were in the house attached to the garage and my husband wouldn’t be home until 5 hours later. I didn’t want to hurt them. 
I was looking at pictures of my daughter, reflecting, and then started listening to the music(which at this point was background) and it was Disturbed, Reason to Fight. I took it as a sign to live and turned off the car and got out. 
Then crumpled to the ground sobbing and getting puppy kisses. I can’t believe that I came that close and was that committed.

Everytime I cross the street I pray for a car to hit me, I tried to hang myself but freaked out at the last minute cause I know way to well psych wards because of my mother's illness and I don't want to go there if I don't succeed in killing myself... I also self harm, not cuts anymore, but I find other way... I don't sleep, I starve myself until I feel dizzy, I take too many paracetamol pills at the same time to see if my body will take it... I used to be shy and reserved but now I even started to get into some fights with random people in the street to see if something will happen to me... I'm messed up, I really am... And I don't know what to do.

Post Abusive Relationships &amp; Troubles keeping my sanity.,"So first off, my name is Aaron. I just turned 25 years old. 

Over the past year I have dealt with severe depression, anxiety attacks and lack of self worth with multiple attempts on taking my life, there are many nights where I can’t sleep because I’ll have panic attacks randomly and it’s taking a toll on me. 

It’s starting to become unbearable, I’ve visited doctors with minor help but I know their intentions are in good intent however when I don’t have people in my life I can talk to or interact with it becomes even harder to deal with, I unfortunately lost of my friends due to a former abusive relationship where I couldn’t spend time with my friends, couldn’t speak to family or even go out for walks. I felt trapped, I was too scared to walk away and it dealt some damage to my self worth. I have tried to get back in contact with former friends but the damage had been done. 

I don’t like being like this but it feels like the only way out. I haven’t really got anyone so no one would notice if I had disappeared and it hurts.

Advice please- long post ahead," 

Hi. Sorry if this is a bit long but I am DESPERATE

So I have a long track history with mental health issues. I am also physically disabled. I didn’t explicitly tell anyone this when I moved in, but I use a walking stick.

I moved into a shared house last month. I was very careful where I moved and chose an estate that felt safe; living with two girls of a similar age with lots common so thought it would be a good match. 

A week into it things started to go wrong. The eldest, G, has a way of communicating very different from mine. She was nagging at me and using a lot of passive-aggressive language when talking. I felt like she was talking down to me, and found myself getting angry because I'm a grown-ass adult and know how to take bins out etc.

We had friction about a sofa, which made things tense because I wanted the sofa and she didn't because she already has her 'special' armchair. She didn’t understand why I need a sofa close to the TV (spoiler: my boyfriend is partially sighted, and my vision isn't great either. I told her this.)

When lockdown hit we talked about not seeing our boyfriends, as everyone lives in shared houses. The youngest, M, said she wanted to still see hers and told me to do the same. I said no and she left. We haven't really spoken since but I know she has been seeing him and has also been to Wales. 

I’ve been trying to make peace by baking, and up social ideas, so we can all get to know each other. When I suggested a movie night, M said she did not want to hang with us and took her things from the shared space.

I've been struggling since sofa-gate, plus I'd already been falling behind at work and taking sick days. I knew I couldn't keep this up. My paranoia was awful at this point, being convinced someone’s tampering with my food and being scared someone is watching/following me. I didn’t tell them because I didn’t know/trust them.

Saturday I accidentally opened a package of M's thinking it was mine and text her to say so. 

Sunday our landlord came to visit, and I was to clean my things in the living room beforehand. I overslept and woke up in a panic. I went downstairs with a massive apology to both G and the landlord but M was not home. 

After this, I fell asleep. I woke to texts from G nagging and from M about the mail. M lost it with me, I apologised and offered a replacement. She said I was crossing a line and it was a complete lack of respect. She also berated me for not cleaning my belongings for the landlord.

I then texted G asking if she was angry at me for not cleaning; she was.

After many texts, I decided it was the final straw. My thoughts were impossible to silence and I called 111.

Fast forward and I am staying at my boyfriend's. I got a text from G about a missing Tupperware. She later sent a photo of it in the bin saying ""I hope this picture helps everybody to remember"". This led to me telling them what happened and that receiving massive angry texts is a trigger for me. If we have something to say, we call a house meeting.

G said that I should have told them before I moved in that I've mental health issues because she has a family with similar issues and she “didn’t sign up for this”. M chimed in and agreed.

I said to stop texting me and they could call me if they needed me. They kept texting me, and the next day asked about my plans. I told them I don't owe them that. They then contacted the landlord.

"""Don't be sad, there's no point being sad."" TF? just tf?","So this happened a couple of days ago, and it seriously makes me angry. So  I was talking to my dad and I hinted about a year ago that I might be depressed and suicidal. After that he never really said anything about it until a few days ago. Now my dad is the kind of person who will say wake up early, exercise and think healthy and all problems will go away. While I'm fine with his methods as long as they're for himself, but he didn't do that. So the story, on Saturday I was a little far too low, and it was visible. And so my dad walked into my room and saw me, then he sat down and talked to me about school and so on. After that he went on about how the weather is pleasant and I should enjoy it. Now that's all fine, but then he said ""Look, there's no point thinking you're useless and all that. Just think that you're useful, you're so useful, you help me so much."" and I internally just lost it, like no shit, i never thought of that, like holy fuck, that's just bad advice on another level.
